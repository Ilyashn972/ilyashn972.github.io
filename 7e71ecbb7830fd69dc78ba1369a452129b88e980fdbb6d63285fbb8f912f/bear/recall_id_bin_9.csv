I lived on the farm and my buddies were from the city. They liked to come to the farm after we went to college and they wanted to do some hunting. Even though I was from a farm, I was not a fan of hunting but I went along when we went hunting for squirrels etc. As we grew older, someone suggested that we go bear hunting in Canada. The other three were mad keen but I was not but allowed them to talk me into it. We took a plane way up north then had to travel a further 500 miles to our hut in the woods. By this time my 3 friends were not as mad keen as they were about hunting bear. We sat around eating and playing cards however we knew that because we had talked about bear hunting so much before we came we knew we had to take one back or we would be totally ridiculed on our return. We decided whoever had the highest card number was the one to hunt the bear needless to say I was the guy who ended up with the job. When I eventually came across a bear, I could not believe how big it was when I fired my gun I had forgot to load it so had to make a run for it chased by the bear. I eventually got back to the cabin, opened the door and left my friends to deal with the bear. Needless to say my friends have never asked to go hunting again."

They had all previously known each other at school, through high-school athletics. The man grew up on a farm. The other three, who were city boys, visited him on the farm. They went shooting rabbits and squirrels. The man wasn't that keen on hunting. It was part of rural life. His three friends loved it. After graduating university, and several years friendship, the group came up with a plan to go bear hunting. The man really wasn't keen on this. He was talked into it. The four of them went to Canada, to the North Woods to hunt their bear. The trip was long. It required a five hundred mile hike to get to the cabin they had booked. Once there they spent the first three days not hunting bears, but instead hanging out, playing cards and so on. On the penultimate night, they decided that they would look very silly if they returned with no bear. So they decided that one of them would go out the next day to hunt a bear. Then the other three would skin the bear and prepare it to take home, down south. The protagonist drew the short straw, and was the hunter. The next day the man went out and walked for a very long time looking for a bear to no avail. Eventually, he saw an enormous bear. He drew his gun. But then realized that he hadn't loaded it. So he couldn't shoot it. The bear was not happy so started to chase him. The man ran, as fast as he could, back to the cabin, with the bear in hot pursuit. As he approached the cabin he shouted for his friends to open the door. As he was nearly at the cabin, the man feigned left. The bear ran straight into the cabin. The man closed the door after him. The man is still friendly with the other three. But they have never since invited him to go hunting with them."

We became acquainted through sport. We went to different schools but through sport became friends. When we finished school, we somehow applied to the same college and became reacquainted. The other three boys were from the city while I was a farm boy. Even though I didn't like hunting, we used to go hunting together, hunting animals like squirrels. One time, the boys decided to go hunt a bear in Canada. I didn't like the idea but had to go along because my friends wanted to go hunting. We left Fort Wayne and went further north into the northern forests of Canada. We reached a lake and took canoes out until we couldn't go further. We then hiked for 500 miles until we reached our cabin. We didn't want to hunt a bear, so we stayed in the cabin for four or five days, playing cards. After four or five days, one of the boys said we need to hunt a bear or the people we told back home would laugh at us. So we decided whoever pulled the highest card would have to hunt the bear. Guess who got picked? The guy who didn't even want to go hunting, me! I walked for bit until I found a huge bear. I didn't even see one so big in pictures. I took the shot and missed. The bear chased me and I ran as fast as I could. When I was close to the cabin, I shouted, ""OPEN THE DOOR! OPEN THE DOOR!"" and quickly turned sharply left. The bear ran straight through the door into the cabin, and I said, ""There, I brought you a bear."" It's no wonder the guys don't take me hunting since this event. This happened 30 years ago."

They all used to enjoy visiting the farm to help out as they were all quite physical. They also like to go hunting for rabbits and the like. Although, even growing up on a farm I did not like hunting. We would often meet up. But after several years one of the guys said about going bear hunting. Even thought this was not something I liked, I agreed to go as we are all part of the group and I didn't have a good excuse. So they planned a trip to the north woods in Canada, we flew up from Fort Wayne and landed on a lake. We hired some canoes to paddle as far as wee could, seemed like over a day. We then left the canoes and had a long hike to an old cabin they had rented. It seems like we must have hiked hundreds of miles. We settled into the cabin but didn't like the look of the woods, we all found it a bit spooky. So much that we would not go outside at night. We just chatted and played cards for several days. When it got near to the time of leaving, one of the guys thought we would be embarrassed not returning with a bear. As a group we decided to cut a deck of cards to decide who would hunt for a bear before I return. As you might guess I was the one who drew the high card, the one who didn't like hunting. I had to follow through, so it was agreed I would hunt the bear and the rest would skin and butcher the bear. I wen out with the old rifle to hunt a bear, it seemed like I wasn't going to find one. But I heard a noise and turned around to see a huge bear, the biggest bear I had seen even in pictures. I raised the rifle , aimed at the bear and pulled the trigger. Nothing, I had forgotten to load the rifle. The bear decided it was going to defend its territory and started towards me, I just turned and ran as fast as I could towards the cabin. Even though in good shape the bear was gaining. Finally the cabin was inside, I shouted for help, called for them to open the door. The bear was almost on me as a reached the door. But rather than go in i swerved to the left of the door, the bear couldn't stop and ran straight into the cabin. I quickly closed the door and called to the guys, over to you, I have hunted the bear, now it is your turn to process the bear. This is what happened over 30 years ago. They have never asked me to go hunting with them since."

Three were from the city and one was from a farm background. All of them were of strong build and liked to help out on the farm and hunt squirrels and other small creatures. In 1949 they planned a bear hunt despite the boy from the farming background being indifferent to the trip. They flew up from Fort Worth into Canada with a view to canoeing up to the Great North Woods. They canoed some great distance and then backpacked up to a cabin that they had rented. The bulk of the time they played cards and did not go out at night. They felt that they had to have some thing to bring back and drew cards to decide who would go out and get the bear. The farm boy went out but had not loaded his rifle. He found a bear that chased him all the way back to the cabin. He yelled to them to open the cabin door and the bear rushed into the cabin. He announced that he had delivered the bear and joked that he was going back for another one. Years later they laughed but he remarked that he was never asked to go on another bear hunt.

I had never seen one so big. I pulled the trigger on the gun, but I had forgotten to load it! The bear started to run at me so I ran as fast as I could, with the bear on my tail all the way back to the cabin.

They got to Canada, landed on a lake took canoes and paddled about a day and half and backpacked for about five hundred miles too til they got to their cabin they had rented.

A decision was made about the person with the highest number of card going to hunt the bear and the remaining will butcher skin and pack him up. Obviously he was the guy who ended up with the highest number. He took an old turkey gun and set of the woods to hunt. He came across a big old looking bear and when he was ready to fire, the gun didn't because he had failed to load it back then. He had no other choice than to run, and by doing so the bear chased him all the way to the cabin where he screamed and shouted for them to let him in. Alas he got in and closed the door where he told his friends, there is your bear, you asked for it and i have done my part, now you guys go do your part. All this happened thirty years ago and since then he hasn't been asked by his friends to go hunting again with them."
