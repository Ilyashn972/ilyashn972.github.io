1,This is a story about three of my friends,57,0,57,57
70,if we don't go out and hunt some bear ...,62,11,51,51
35,"I don't care anything really much about hunting period,",62,11,51,51
22,"But these guys got a big kick out of it,",47,0,47,47
69,"and somebody said “Hey,",45,0,45,45
20,"Uh ... being born and raised on the farm I was used to the outdoors,",53,11,42,42
79,so we could take him home with us.,41,0,41,41
121,"But can you BELIEVE,",60,100,-40,40
63,no one was in the mood to go out and hunt bear,61,22,39,39
4,"Actually I met them before that,",50,11,39,39
64,'cause that's just a plain old spooky looking place.,39,0,39,39
21,wasn't all that exciting to me.,49,11,38,38
91,I'd never even seen a PICTURE of one THAT big.,47,11,36,36
30,"Now that didn't really appeal to me,",66,100,-34,34
74,and if we come home skunked with no bear they're really going to give us a bad time.”,34,0,34,34
3,when I started college.,66,100,-34,34
2,that I met in 1949,66,100,-34,34
115,"and pulled the door shut,",66,100,-34,34
87,"and I just wasn't seeing any bears or anything,",54,22,32,32
50,"I was even more apprehensive than I had been even before we started,",45,77,-32,32
43,"and then we rented canoes,",68,100,-32,32
49,"And after I got there,",31,0,31,31
62,and we just couldn't ...,31,0,31,31
52,"That was pretty spooky looking territory, let me tell you.",58,88,-30,30
37,Be about my luck the bear would wind up hunting me.,29,0,29,29
33,"so I left them talk me into it,",71,100,-29,29
23,so I'd go along just to be one of the group.,59,88,-29,29
13,the other three guys all lived in the city.,71,100,-29,29
96,Well he had ...,28,0,28,28
14,"So being big macho men that we all were,",50,22,28,28
41,"and we flew way up into Canada some place,",72,100,-28,28
40,"So we took an airplane out of Fort Wayne,",72,100,-28,28
38,"But as I said,",27,0,27,27
47,"then we had to backpack for another ... five hundred miles I thought,",73,100,-27,27
60,"and ate,",61,88,-27,27
44,"and paddled for another ... day and a half it seemed to me,",73,100,-27,27
122,they haven't asked me to go hunting one time since that day.,73,100,-27,27
92,"I whipped up the gun,",71,44,27,27
98,and he made for me.,49,22,27,27
68,"we got to talking it over,",59,33,26,26
17,and help me do chores and things like that.,48,22,26,26
67,"Well after we'd been there for three or four days,",37,11,26,26
65,"We never ventured outside at night,",37,11,26,26
95,I'd forgot to LOAD that turkey.,48,22,26,26
112,"I made a quick turn to the left,",74,100,-26,26
75,"Soo ... no one wanted to go out,",35,11,24,24
77,"Whoever got the high card ... would go out and get a bear,",79,55,24,24
51,'cause I didn't really need any part of that.,24,0,24,24
25,"we did this for several years,",24,0,24,24
100,"and I turned around,",78,100,-22,22
111,"and I got right to the cabin door,",66,44,22,22
113,and that old bear went right on in.,79,100,-21,21
61,"and slept,",57,77,-20,20
58,"We sat around there for three or four days,",68,88,-20,20
31,"but I'd always been one of the group,",58,77,-19,19
6,went to school at the same place.,58,77,-19,19
105,he was just right on my heels ...,62,44,18,18
16,"and they'd come out,",51,33,18,18
86,"I'm walking out there in the woods for hours it seems like,",62,44,18,18
120,and all my buddies agreed ... that I lived up to my commitment.,59,77,-18,18
7,"Previous to that during high school we'd all been high school athletes at different schools,",71,88,-17,17
106,And when I got within sight of that cabin,84,100,-16,16
114,"I just reached back,",62,77,-15,15
81,the guy that didn't even want to be there in the first place.,59,44,15,15
101,"I ran as hard as I could go,",81,66,15,15
94,and nothing happened.,85,100,-15,15
46,"Then after we ... went as far as we could in the canoes,",52,66,-14,14
59,"played cards,",74,88,-14,14
80,"So you know who YOU KNOW WHO got the high card,",86,100,-14,14
76,so we all decided that we'd cut the cards.,86,100,-14,14
28,"After we'd been acquainted for several years,",47,33,14,14
83,"So ... I took the old gun,",74,88,-14,14
24,"Things went on,",13,0,13,13
12,"I was the kid from the farm,",87,100,-13,13
48,'till we got to this cabin that they had rented way up there in the north woods.,75,88,-13,13
9,"But then after graduation when we all enrolled in school,",64,77,-13,13
11,and we became quite good friends.,68,55,13,13
116,"and said “THERE HE IS FELLOWS,",78,66,12,12
99,"Well there was nothing for me to do but run,",89,100,-11,11
119,"Now all this happened thirty years ago,",55,44,11,11
118,I'LL GO GET ANOTHER ONE!”,55,44,11,11
8,and so we were acquainted.,55,66,-11,11
10,"we found that the four of us were all now attending the same school,",77,88,-11,11
55,and ... got our groceries stored and everything.,33,22,11,11
71,"we've got to find a bear to take back home with us,",65,55,10,10
15,"they used to like to come out to the farm and hunt,",91,100,-9,9
66,we stayed right there in the old cabin.,42,33,9,9
97,"he just had no desires to have me in his territory,",53,44,9,9
39,I left them talk me into it.,53,44,9,9
18,Then we'd go rabbit hunting and squirrel hunting and things of that nature.,85,77,8,8
5,we became friends after we all...,36,44,-8,8
117,"YOU SKIN HIM,",74,66,8,8
34,wasn't too hepped up on this at all.,52,44,8,8
108,"Man I was whipping down there just as hard as I could go,",52,44,8,8
56,And after we got to discussing it,48,55,-7,7
57,those guys weren't any more hot about going out in those woods and looking for a bear than I was.,73,66,7,7
27,and hunting.,48,55,-7,7
84,and I go out bear hunting.,40,33,7,7
82,But I had agreed to play the game ...,59,66,-7,7
54,"and got set up in the cabin,",49,55,-6,6
29,one of them got the idea they'd like to go bear hunting up in Canada.,94,100,-6,6
110,"and they opened the door,",72,66,6,6
26,"they were always coming out to the farm,",49,55,-6,6
45,'till we got way up in the north woods.,49,44,5,5
104,"man he was gaining,",72,77,-5,5
103,"but that old bear,",70,66,4,4
88,"and finally I heard a noise,",62,66,-4,4
89,"and I turned around,",62,66,-4,4
73,"'cause too many people know we'd gone bear hunting,",73,77,-4,4
109,"and that old bear right on my tail,",48,44,4,4
90,"and there was the biggest old bear I'd ever seen in my life,",91,88,3,3
19,I never really enjoyed hunting.,80,77,3,3
42,"and we landed on a lake,",58,55,3,3
85,I didn't like this at all.,30,33,-3,3
93,"and pulled the trigger,",68,66,2,2
102,"and I thought I used to be pretty fast,",68,66,2,2
36,let alone bear hunting.,35,33,2,2
32,"and I couldn't find any real reason not to go,",54,55,-1,1
72,"or we're really going to get a bad time from the rest of the people,",78,77,1,1
107,"I started yelling “OPEN THE DOOR, OPEN THE DOOR!”",87,88,-1,1
53,"So we got up there,",33,33,0,0
