Time went by and the friends came up with the idea of going to Canada to hunt a bear. Again the narrator wasn't keen but was persuaded to go. They flew to Canada, took kayaks across the lake and got to a cabin. They felt the place they were in was too spooky, none of them wanted to go out hunting in the end. They stayed in for 3-4 days. In the end they discussed how they would be mocked for not bringing a bear back so split cards to see who should go hunting for one. The narrator was chosen. He went out, saw a huge bear but had forgotten to load his gun so he ran away towards the cabin. He yelled for the friends to open the door because he had a bear and they did but instead of going in he dashed to one side and the bear went in the cabin.

They had to go across a lake to get to the woods and had to walk what felt like five hundred miles to get to their cabin. The walk was scary so it put them off wanting to go hunting for bears as they were all spooked out. So for a few days they just stayed in the cabin together and played cards. Then they realised that if they didn't bring back a bear people wouldn't believe them and would probably make fun of them. So they played the high cards game and who ever picked the highest card had to go and hunt the bear alone and bring it back to the cabin dead. The others would skin the bear and prepare it to take back as a trophy. The story teller got the high card so had to go out and hunt. He went out and took a gun, found a bear bigger than he'd even seen on pictures. He went to shoot it and realised that he hadn't loaded the gun so ran instead.

5bc879d3836d560001fc421a,A boy met three other boys slightly before they all attended college together in 1949. The boy telling the story grew up on a farm. The other three grew up in the city. For this reason the city boys were quite keen on the idea of hunting. The farm boy was not so thrilled as this was quite normal to his general way of life. They would hunt together on his property. Even though the boy wasn't keen he did it to fit in with the group. One day they all decided to take a trip to northern Canada to try to hunt a bear. The boy was still not keen but was pressured to go with his group. They flew out of Fort Wayne and headed to northern Canada together. They went to some woods where they had rented a spooky looking cabin. For days the boys could not bring themselves to go and look for the bear as they were scared by their surrounding. So they played cards and drank and slept. Before they were due to come home they were worried that people would make fun of them if they came back and had not brought a bear. So they drew cards and the boy telling the story unfortunately drew the short straw (so to speak). He went out into the woods and found a bear. The bear chased him all the way back to the cabin. He let the bear into the cabin and said there you go boys there a bear to skin ill go and get another one.

The other 3 lived in the city however I was brought up on a farm and they liked to come up to the farm to help with chores and hunt. As we grew up we were talking one day and someone mentioned about going bear hunting however I really didn’t want to go. I also didn’t want to disappoint the group so I agreed to go even through I didn’t want to. So we took a flight to the canal where we then had to use canoes to get to the bottom of the mountain which seemed to take forever. Once we got to the mountain we then had to walk what felt like 5 days to get to the cabin. Once we got to the cabin we realised how scary the place was so we decided to stay inside and not go out so we stayed in the cabin playing cards. Towards the end of the break we realised if we didn’t take a bear home with us we would be talked about unkindly so we decided that we would cut cards and whoever got the highest would be the one to go get a bear and the remaining 3 would be the ones to skin the bear ready to take home. Unluckily it was me who got the highest card so I went out in the scary woods looking for a bear. I finally found the biggest bear I had ever seen ( even in a photo!) I shot the gun but it didn’t go off as it hadn’t been loaded. So I ran and ran back towards the cabin. When the cabin was in sight I shouted “open the door” when the door opened I moved to the left and the bear ran in! I told the rest id done my bit!

Once back on land we had to trek for a further 500 miles. The guys had rented a cabin in the woods. We had supplies for a few nights. The strange thing is, we didn't go hunting. We just stayed in the cabin, eating, sleeping and playing cards. The woods were really spooky up there. It seemed that the guys had lost all interest in hunting a bear. So we just stayed in the cabin. Towards to the end of our stay one of the guys said we're going to look stupid if we don't come back with a bear. So we decided to draw cards to see who would venture into the woods to kill the bear. The other guys would have the job of skinning and cutting the meat. We drew our cards. Can you believe it? The guy who didn't want to go in the first place drew the bear card. So out I went into the spooky woods. I looked for a bear. Suddenly I looked up and saw a bear. It was huge. I've never even seen a picture of a bear so big. Here was one starring right at me. I whipped up the shotgun. I pulled the trigger. But nothing happened. Like a complete turkey I had only forgot to load the damn thing. That bear was furious. He did not want me on his turf. So I turned and ran like hell. I saw the cabin up ahead.

The author had lived on a farm. But the other three were from the city. The friends used to meet up on the farm to hunt for rabbits and squirrels. The city boys used to enjoy it more than the author. He'd been brought up on the farm. So it was the norm for him. And he didn't get excited by it. This went on for quite a few years. Until one day the young men decided that they would like to go bear hunting in Canada. Whilst the idea didn't really appeal to the author. He was part of the group. And got talked into going along with them. He was concerned that he may be hunted by the bear rather than the other way round. They took an aeroplane. And landed on a lake. It was still a long way to their destination. And they had to hike and use canoes to get there. They reached their cabin. But the author was still apprehensive about the expedition. And described it as spooky. In fact, none of the men wanted to go out into the woods. So they stayed in the cabin for several days. They had taken groceries with them. And played cards. They then discussed the shame of returning home having not hunted a bear. As they had told too many people about it. And knew that there was an expectation. They used the cards to determine who was going to go out to hunt the bear. The person who drew the high card would be the one to go. Unfortunately for the author, it was him. Typical as he was the one that didn't want to be there in the first place. He grabbed his and went into the woods. There was a noise. And he turned around to face the biggest bear ever. He aimed at it with his gun. Then realised he had forgotten to load it. The bear was angry. And started to chase him. Luckily, despite the bear being on his heels, he reached the cabin. And shouted for the others to open the door. He then made a quick left turn. But the bear turned right. Once safely inside the cabin, the author then said to his friends ""There he is.

The travelling took a long time by plane, canoe and a 500 mile walk to the north woods.

I did not like the idea but because we are friends I let them convince me otherwise. So, we booked a flight to go there and stayed in an old creepy cabin. For the first couple of days, we were settling in and playing games. At some point, the idea of bear hunting grew and we started talking about it again. There was some indecision about who was going to out and hunt the bear. To solve the problem, we played a game of cards and whomever accumulated the most points will be the one going out. I was the one who did, the person who was not interested in going there in the first place. I went out in the woods, for same time it was very quite with not activity. I heard a sound and as I turned to see where it came from, a huge bear was staring at me. I was very scared and the first instinct was to shoot.

When they got to the destination of the cabin they would be staying for the next 4 nights they realised how spooky the woods were and all decided they was no longer keen on the idea of bear hunting so for three days then stayed in the cabin playing card games. Then on the last day they decided they would need to go bear hunting as they had told so many people and if they came back empty handed they wouldn't hear the end of it.

Before, he was acquainted with them because they all went to separate high schools but were all athletes who saw each other in passing. Anyway, they got close in college and the man lived on the farm and the other three lived in the city. Because of this, the three would love to come to the farm and help the man do chores or do ""macho"" stuff like hunting. They liked hunting squirrels and small things, but the man wasn't as interested because this was his regular life and it wasn't exciting. He went along with it because he wanted to be part of the group though. Later on, maybe a couple of years, the three friends wanted to go on a hunting trip to hunt bear, and although the man wasn't that interested now either, he agreed to go for the same reason as before. So, they all went to the northern woods where one of the friends rented a cabin. On the journey, they encounter scary bears and the woods itself was scary, had to paddle for forever in kayaks, and when they got the cabin eventually they all decided to stay inside because they were spooked. Inside they played card games and stuff, and near the end of the 3-4 day trip, they decided that because they told everyone back at home they'd catch a bear, then they needed to bring a bear back. They played a game to decide who would go out and shoot the bear and bring it back for the others to skin and pack. Funnily, the farmer man who didn't even want to go in the first place got the short end of the stick. He got a gun and went out though, as a man of his word. He happened to come across a bear, but it was a HUGE bear. Bigger than anything the man's seen or heard of. He tried to shoot it, but he realized he didn't load the gun. So, the only thing he could do was run because now he's angered the bear. He ran with the bear hot on his heels and went back to the cabin screaming for his three friends to open the door. They opened the door, he went inside, but the bear ended up following him in too. The man told his friends 'alright, I brought the bear to you guys to skin and pack'.

On the penultimate night, they decided that they would look very silly if they returned with no bear. So they decided that one of them would go out the next day to hunt a bear. Then the other three would skin the bear and prepare it to take home, down south. The protagonist drew the short straw, and was the hunter. The next day the man went out and walked for a very long time looking for a bear to no avail. Eventually, he saw an enormous bear. He drew his gun. But then realized that he hadn't loaded it.

Actually I met them before that, we became friends after we all... went to school at the same place. Previous to that during high school we'd all been school athletes at different schools, and so we were acquainted. But then after graduation after we all enrolled in school, we found that the four of us were all now attending the same school, and became quite good friends. I was the kid from the farm, the other three guys all lived in the city. So being big macho men that we all were, they used to come out to the farm and hunt, and they'd come out, and help me do chores and things like that. Then we'd go rabbit hunting and squirrel hunting and things of that nature. I never really enjoyed hunting. Uh... being born and raised.",811,22,329.2,216.35238926985647

So the other city friends loved to come hunting in the farm with their friend who lives there. And although he hates hunting he always accompanies his friends while they hunt. And years passed then one day they suggested they go Bear hunting in Canada and even though he hates the idea he still allowed his friends to talk him into doing it. They travelled and lodged in a spooky old cabin for days as they did not feel the need to go bear hunting anymore and one day while they were playing cards, they decided to play a game to choose who will go bear hunting and deliver the bear to the others to skin and take back to the city. Unluckily he was picked and he went out looking for a bear, he spotted one big old Bear and just when he wanted to shoot he realised he did not load his gun and so the Bear chased him all the way to the cabin and when he was near he screamed to be let in. The story ended with them agreeing that he did part of his bargain by bringing the Bear to them and they had the choice to skin the bear.",1139,26,66.48,89.88158500425139

668936b212cea5becb2cf810,"It was a story in the year 1949 about a guy who made friends in school. These friends all loved hunting but him being someone raised to farm he didn't much love hunting and all. So after school his friends decided to travel to Canada to go bear hunting. He didn't really like that idea but since he has been part of that group, they talked him into it. They got to Canada, landed on a lake took canoes and paddled about a day and half and backpacked for about five hundred miles too til they got to their cabin they had rented. The place was way spooky that they forgot they had come to hunt bears rather they played cards and this went on for about 3 days where one of them came up with the idea they really had to go hunt a bear because they couldn't go home empty handed. A decision was made about the person with the highest number of card going to hunt the bear and the remaining will butcher skin and pack him up. Obviously he was the guy who ended up with the highest number. He took an old turkey gun and set of the woods to hunt. He came across a big old looking bear and when he was ready to fire, the gun didn't because he had failed to load it back then. He had no other choice than to run, and by doing so the bear chased him all the way to the cabin where he screamed and shouted for them to let him in. Alas he got in and closed the door where he told his friends, there is your bear, you asked for it and i have done my part, now you guys go do your part. All this happened thirty years ago and since then he hasn't been asked by his friends to go hunting again with them.",1588,13,118.93,154.39095078152957

66a2ba211e0d673905b1db03,"The man was an high school athlete, and was acquainted with some other high school athletes. After high school, they found themselves attending the same college and became friends. He was from the farm while the other three were from the city. Over the years, they came down to the farm to do some hunting. The man wasn't really a big fan of hunting because he grew up outdoors, but to the rest of them, it was a lot of fun. One day, the three friends brought a suggestion to go bear hunting in Canada. The man did not want to but he let them talk him into it. They packed up, took a flight up to Canada. They landed on a lake, paddled in a canoe for what seemed like a day and a half, and then hiked what seemed like 500 miles before arriving at a cabin in the woods that they had rented. Upon settling down in the cabin, they all decided that they weren't exactly hyped up about going bear hunting. So for the next three or four days, they stayed indoors, played card games, and ate. On the third or fourth day, one of them brought it up that they had to get a bear so as not to disappoint the people waiting for them back at home. To decide who goes out to hunt the bear, they drew cards. The person with the highest card had to go hunt the bear, while the others would skin it and prepare it for travel. After they drew cards, it turned out it was the man who did not even want to go in the first place that got the highest card. He took the old gun and set out. After what seemed like hours, he heard a growl behind and looked back to see the biggest bear he had ever seen in his life. He picked up the gun and fired, but nothing happened. Turned out he had forgotten to load the gun. He turned on his heels and started running as fast as he could, with the bear on his heels. When he got in sight of the cabin, he started shouting for them to open the door. The door opened, but instead of going in, he took a left around the cabin, while the bear went straight inside. He quickly closed the cabin door and told his friends that he had brought the bear, it was their turn to skin it. Eventually, they agreed that he actually played his part. Although this happened 30 years ago, they never asked him to go hunting since that day.",2235,34,207.39000000000001,234.5514828441594
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,"I know a story from 1949, when I had three friends in college, who I had been in the same class as in highschool, but grew close too in college when we realised we came from the same school. They were 3 macho men, and we all had been athletes. After a few years, one of them suggested that we go up to Canada to go squirrel and rabbit hunting. I didn't really like hunting, but I had done everything with that group, so I left them talk me into it. One of them eventually suggested we go bear hunting instead, so we took a plane up to Fort Wayne, and hiked for a day and a half up to a cabin. The woods were really spooky, and all the others suddenly didn't feel like going bear hunting either, like me. So for a few days we waited in the cabin, eating, sleeping, playing cards, until one of us realised that too many people knew we had gone back bear hunting, so we needed to head back with a bear. They decided, and I agreed, that they would cut cards to decide which one of us would go out, get a bear, and bring it back for the rest to skin and pack so we can take it home. And WHO WOULD HAVE GUESSED, but it was the guy who didn't even want to go hunting in the first place. But I had agreed to this process. So I took our shotgun, went out and walked for hours but didn't find anything, when suddenly I heard a noise, and turned to see the biggest old bear I have ever seen. I aimed my gun and shot it at it, but then realised I had forgotten to load it! But the bear didn't like having me in its territory, so it came after me. I turned and ran. I thought I was pretty fast, but the old bear was gaining on me. I ran as fast as I could back to the cabin, yelling ""OPEN THE DOOR, OPEN THE DOOR"". They opened the door to the cabin, and at the last moment I turned left, the bear turned right into the cabin, and I turned and shut the door. I yelled ""OK I FOUND A BEAR NOW YOU GUYS SKIN AND PACK IT, I WILL GO FIND ANOTHER ONE"". The others couldn't deny that I had done what I had been told to do, but they haven't invited me out hunting since...",2050,46,235.32999999999998,276.2234470658515

However, they only started being friends after they all found out they were going to the same post-secondary school. The man was a rural boy while his 3 friends were city boys, and because of this the 3 all had a knack for hunting. In 1949, the group decided to go bear hunting, despite the man not really wanting to. They then travelled to Canada via plane and trekked through the woods to get to a cabin, but the eerie atmosphere caused none of them to actually want to go hunting. They thought of the consequences of coming back with no bear, which caused them to decide to send one person out there to hunt, which happened to be the man. He ended up finding a giant old bear, but forgot to load the gun, so he had to run back to the cabin with the bear on his tail, thankfully being safe. 30 years later and his 3 friends haven't asked him to go hunting since.",946,17,71.77,74.20052767845036
