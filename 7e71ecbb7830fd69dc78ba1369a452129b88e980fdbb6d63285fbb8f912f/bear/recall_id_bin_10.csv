We were all athletes in different schools. I was the farm guy and they were from the city. Our friendship grew when we started attending the same school we all applied for. They were interested in the farm life, so they would come visit. They helped with chores, daily tasks and explore the environment. I was not as enthusiastic because I was already accustomed to the life but I joined in because I was part of the friendship. In all the activities done in the farm, they were mostly interested in hunting. The interest grew to the point of them suggesting that we go bear hunting in the woods of Canada. I did not like the idea but because we are friends I let them convince me otherwise. So, we booked a flight to go there and stayed in an old creepy cabin. For the first couple of days, we were settling in and playing games. At some point, the idea of bear hunting grew and we started talking about it again. There was some indecision about who was going to out and hunt the bear. To solve the problem, we played a game of cards and whomever accumulated the most points will be the one going out. I was the one who did, the person who was not interested in going there in the first place. I went out in the woods, for same time it was very quite with not activity. I heard a sound and as I turned to see where it came from, a huge bear was staring at me. I was very scared and the first instinct was to shoot. Unfortunately I did not load the gun and in a state of panic I resorted to running. It was in that moment, I realized that I was not much of a fast runner. The bear was right behind me. I managed to get to the cabin, and shouted, signaling my friends to open. They did just that but the bear came in with me. I declared that I had did my part and it was time for them to do theirs. After that experience, they had never talked about bear hunting again."

I got acquainted with some guys in college. These guys loved to hunt... rabbits and deers and things. I am not the hunting type, but I usually went with them and entertained those ideas. Eventually, they started talking about hunting a bear, and finally convinced me to go with them. I was totally talked into going, even though I did not want to. Well, we travelled up north canada into some woods to hunt bears. The group of us canoed up into the woods as far as we could go, and then backpacked the ret of the way... what felt like 500 miles... to a cabin that they rented. It was a really spooky place, and when we were there no one felt like actually going out and hunting. We ended up sleeping, eating and playing cards for three or four days. On the fourth or fifth day, one guy piped up and said that we better not go home empty handed when everyone knew that we were coming to hunt some bears. If we went home empty handed we would never hear the end of it. So we all decided that we would draw cards, and whoever got the highest would go out and hunt the bear, and the others would skin it and cut it into chunks to take home. Guess who drew the highest card... the guy who DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO BE THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE. But I had agreed to play the game. So I took the gun and went out. It felt like I had walked for hours and hours in those woods and found nothing. Eventually, I heard a noice behind me, I turned and saw the biggest bear I had ever seen. I had never even seen a bear that big in a PICTURE. And that old bear was not happy that I was in his territory. The only thing I could do was turn around and run run run, but that old bear was fast. He was right on my tail. When the cabin was in sight I started yelling ""Open the door, open the door"", with the bear hot on my tail. The guys opened the door, but before going in I quickly turned to the left, but the bear went straight inside. I closed the door and shouted THERE YOU HAVE YOUR BEAR. This story was thirty years ago, and who wouldve guessed that I have never been invited to go hunting with them again."

They convinced the main character to go as he had no other reason not to despite the fact he didn't like hunting. But he got convinced and they left for Canada. They took a flight out from from Fort Wayne and landed near a lake in Canada. They rented Canoes to cross the river and get to their destination. In total it took 500 miles to get to their location. They got to the cabin where they stayed for 3 or 4 days and didn't hunt due to the creepy nature of their surroundings. They played cards, ate food and slept in this cabin for these days. Eventually one of the friends said they need to hunt a bear because they would be given a hard time if they came back empty handed to their folks. They used a highest card goes to hunt to decide who will go hunting. The man who didn't even want to come had the highest card and was sent to hunt. He found the bear and was bigger than anything he had ever seen. When he went for the shot his gun was not loaded and he had to run whilst the bear started chasing him down. He ran back down to the cabin screaming for the door to be open as the bear was on his heels. He ran in and avoided the bear and the bear got put down. After this they never went hunting again and this was a story recalled from 30 years ago."

One of the friends grew up in the countryside on a farm and the other three lived in the city. The three city boys would often visit the friend at the farm as they enjoyed the outdoor life. The farm boy, although not excited by hunting, would take his friends hunting for squirrels and rabbits, to please them. When the three city boys suggested going on a bear hunt, the farm boy felt obliged. After flying to the forest and hiking 500 miles they reached a cabin to stay in. The forest looked spooky and neither of them wanted to risk hunting for a bear. After three or four days, they decided the shame of going home without a bear was too much. They drew cards to decide who would go and hunt the bear, with the other three required to butcher and skin the bear. The farm boy, who was not keen on the bear hunt in the first place, drew the highest card and unwillingly took the gun and went to find a bear. After a while he came upon the largest bear he had ever seen, in real life or photo. The bear was clearly not happy about him being on his territory and as he made towards him, the man tried to take a shot. However, the gun was not loaded and the man was forced to run for his life. He approached the cabin as the bear was gaining on him. The man shouted to his friends to open the cabin door. The man turned at the last minute, just to see the bear enter the cabin. The man said ""Here's the bear for you, like you asked. I am going back out to find another"". Unsurprisingly, the three city boys never asked the farm boy to ever go hunting again."

They became close buddies at College. The main character lived on a farm and the other 3 were city boys. The city boys liked to spend time on the farm and enjoyed helping with chores and particularly hunting. The main character did not enjoy hunting at all. However later on his 3 friends wanted to go and hunt Bears, so they took off to Canada with the idea to catch and kill a bear and take home. When they arrived in Canada their lodgings were deep in the woods which they found quite scary. None of the men wanted to go out at all and stayed inside for days. Then they decided that they could not go home without taking a bear to show people the results of the Bear hunt and they decided to draw cards as to which one of them would go out and hunt the Bear. The main character happened to draw the highest card even thought this was his worst case scenario, he did go out and eventually found a bear. He became so frightened he could not kill it, instead he turned and ran back to the cabin. As he got close he shouted to his friends to open the door, the Bear was right on his heels. They opened the door he ran in and turned to the left, with the Bear following him into the cabin. 'There' he said to his friends I did what you asked me!"

They were high school athletes that were in different high schools but became friends in college. The main character was from a farm but the other three were from the city so they all used to go to the farm and hunt rabbits and squirrels. The main character was not too fussed with hunting as he grew up on a farm. They did this for several years. The three friends talked about how they wanted to go bear hunting. The main character was not keen but wanted to be a apart of the group so agreed. They then flew from Fort Wayne to Canada and went to a big lake where they rented canoes. They then went to the North woods and in what seemed like 500 miles, got to an old cabin they rented. For 3-4 days they did not want to go bear hunting as they found the woods spooky and did not go out at night. One member of the group stated how they could not come back empty handed as they had told many people of their plans so they drew cards and agreed whoever got the high card would hunt the bear and the other three would skin it. The main character drew the high card and went out to find a bear. He saw an old giant bear and tried to shoot it but realised he did not load his gun. He ran away but the bear was gaining on him. He screamed to his friends to open the cabin door and the bear went into the cabin. The main character told them that he fulfilled his promise and they have to skin him now. They still talk about this 30 years later."
