606c7b742c448e3ca901220c,1,A man had three friends in college in 1949.
606c7b742c448e3ca901220c,2,"They had previously been acquainted as high school athletes,"
606c7b742c448e3ca901220c,3,"but once they entered school together,"
606c7b742c448e3ca901220c,4,they all became friends.
606c7b742c448e3ca901220c,5,The man was a farm boy
606c7b742c448e3ca901220c,6,"and his friends were all from the city,"
606c7b742c448e3ca901220c,7,so they came to his family's farm to hunt and help out with chores.
606c7b742c448e3ca901220c,8,"One day, they decided to go hunt a bear,"
606c7b742c448e3ca901220c,9,and the man joined them even though he didn't really want to.
606c7b742c448e3ca901220c,10,"They took a plane up to Canada,"
606c7b742c448e3ca901220c,11,"and then took their canoes on a big lake,"
606c7b742c448e3ca901220c,12,"travelled that way for a few days,"
606c7b742c448e3ca901220c,13,and then backpacked another 500 miles or so until they reached the cabin they had rented.
606c7b742c448e3ca901220c,14,"The area around the cabin was a spooky wood,"
606c7b742c448e3ca901220c,15,so they were afraid to go out into the woods.
606c7b742c448e3ca901220c,16,"Eventually, they decided that,"
606c7b742c448e3ca901220c,17,"since everyone was expecting them to bring home a bear,"
606c7b742c448e3ca901220c,18,that they had to actually go out and hunt.
606c7b742c448e3ca901220c,19,They drew cards to determine who was going to go out and get the bear
606c7b742c448e3ca901220c,20,"(the rest would skin and pack it),"
606c7b742c448e3ca901220c,21,and it was the narrator who was chosen.
606c7b742c448e3ca901220c,22,He went out with his gun
606c7b742c448e3ca901220c,23,"and found a massive bear,"
606c7b742c448e3ca901220c,24,"but when he went to shoot it,"
606c7b742c448e3ca901220c,25,he found he had forgotten to load his gun.
606c7b742c448e3ca901220c,26,"The bear chased him back to the cabin,"
606c7b742c448e3ca901220c,27,and his friends opened the door for him just in time.
606c7b742c448e3ca901220c,28,"It has been 30 years since then,"
606c7b742c448e3ca901220c,29,and his friends haven't invited him to go hunting again.
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,1,I knew some acquaintances
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,2,and then when I went to a new school
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,3,they were then also there
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,4,and we got to being good friends.
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,5,We were all on the same athletics team.
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,6,The other 3 lived in the city
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,7,however I was brought up on a farm
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,8,and they liked to come up to the farm to help with chores and hunt.
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,9,As we grew up
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,10,we were talking one day
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,11,and someone mentioned about going bear hunting
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,12,however I really didn’t want to go.
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,13,I also didn’t want to disappoint the group
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,14,so I agreed to go even through I didn’t want to.
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,15,So we took a flight to the canal
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,16,where we then had to use canoes to get to the bottom of the mountain
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,17,which seemed to take forever.
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,18,Once we got to the mountain
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,19,we then had to walk what felt like 5 days to get to the cabin.
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,20,Once we got to the cabin
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,21,we realised how scary the place was
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,22,so we decided to stay inside and not go out
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,23,so we stayed in the cabin playing cards.
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,24,Towards the end of the break
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,25,we realised if we didn’t take a bear home with us
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,26,we would be talked about unkindly
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,27,so we decided that we would cut cards
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,28,and whoever got the highest would be the one to go get a bear
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,29,and the remaining 3 would be the ones to skin the bear ready to take home.
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,30,Unluckily it was me who got the highest card
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,31,so I went out in the scary woods looking for a bear.
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,32,I finally found the biggest bear I had ever seen ( even in a photo!)
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,33,I shot the gun but it didn’t go off as it hadn’t been loaded.
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,34,So I ran and ran back towards the cabin.
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,35,When the cabin was in sight
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,36,I shouted “open the door”
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,37,when the door opened
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,38,I moved to the left
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,39,and the bear ran in!
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,40,I told the rest id done my bit!
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,41,Looking back now
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,42,the group all agree that I did infact do my bit!
5cfc19ae3ce1c80001ddd88d,1,a guy went to college in 1949
5cfc19ae3ce1c80001ddd88d,2,and made some friends
6149d516a3c16102a1a816bb,1,A boy lived on a farm
6149d516a3c16102a1a816bb,2,and in high school was an athlete.
6149d516a3c16102a1a816bb,3,When he went to college
6149d516a3c16102a1a816bb,4,he made friends with 3 other city boys
6149d516a3c16102a1a816bb,5,who were also athlete
6149d516a3c16102a1a816bb,6,he knew before.
6149d516a3c16102a1a816bb,7,They came to his farm
6149d516a3c16102a1a816bb,8,to help with chores
6149d516a3c16102a1a816bb,9,and hunt.
6149d516a3c16102a1a816bb,10,One day they decided they would go to canada
6149d516a3c16102a1a816bb,11,to hunt a bear.
6149d516a3c16102a1a816bb,12,They flew to canada
6149d516a3c16102a1a816bb,13,and canoed all the way north
6149d516a3c16102a1a816bb,14,and walked a long way
6149d516a3c16102a1a816bb,15,to an old creepy cabin.
6149d516a3c16102a1a816bb,16,When they got there
6149d516a3c16102a1a816bb,17,they unpacked their food
6149d516a3c16102a1a816bb,18,and all decided they didn't want to hunt a bear.
6149d516a3c16102a1a816bb,19,After a few days
6149d516a3c16102a1a816bb,20,they thought they had to go out
6149d516a3c16102a1a816bb,21,and get a bear to bring back home.
6149d516a3c16102a1a816bb,22,They cut cards
6149d516a3c16102a1a816bb,23,and the person with the highest card had to go out
6149d516a3c16102a1a816bb,24,and hunt.
6149d516a3c16102a1a816bb,25,The main story teller cut the highest card
6149d516a3c16102a1a816bb,26,and went out to find a bear.
6149d516a3c16102a1a816bb,27,He found an old big bear
6149d516a3c16102a1a816bb,28,and when he went to shot
6149d516a3c16102a1a816bb,29,he found out the gun was not loaded.
6149d516a3c16102a1a816bb,30,He ran back to the cabin
6149d516a3c16102a1a816bb,31,being chased by the bear
6149d516a3c16102a1a816bb,32,and managed to get inside
6149d516a3c16102a1a816bb,33,and close the door on the bear.
6149d516a3c16102a1a816bb,34,He has never been asked to return hunting with that group.
5de83e5748241d7af1b6c348,1,The main character of the story had a group of friends
5de83e5748241d7af1b6c348,2,whom he knew from he was very young.
5de83e5748241d7af1b6c348,3,They went to the same school
5de83e5748241d7af1b6c348,4,and same college
5de83e5748241d7af1b6c348,5,"and he's from a farm,"
5de83e5748241d7af1b6c348,6,where they were from the city.
5de83e5748241d7af1b6c348,7,The city boys loved visiting the farm
5de83e5748241d7af1b6c348,8,and him to go hunt and play there
5de83e5748241d7af1b6c348,9,The farm boy wasn't that keen on hunting at all
5de83e5748241d7af1b6c348,10,as he's from the farm
5de83e5748241d7af1b6c348,11,and he's good at outdoors.
5de83e5748241d7af1b6c348,12,"One day, they went to the North Woods in Canada to hunt bear."
5de83e5748241d7af1b6c348,13,No one wanted to hunt bear
5de83e5748241d7af1b6c348,14,when they've reached the cabin in the woods in a very remote territory
5de83e5748241d7af1b6c348,15,They decided to pick the high card
5de83e5748241d7af1b6c348,16,and whoever got the high card will have to go bear hunting.
5de83e5748241d7af1b6c348,17,The main character was the unfortunate one.
5de83e5748241d7af1b6c348,18,He went to try to hunt the bear
5de83e5748241d7af1b6c348,19,but the gun wasn't loaded.
60c729ef719e831b68527d87,1,The story is about a guy and his three friends who met in college and later became friends.
60c729ef719e831b68527d87,2,"Although they met in college, they previously knew each other though from high school days."
60c729ef719e831b68527d87,3,"So, when they met in college, that is when they became close."
60c729ef719e831b68527d87,4,"This particular guy grew up on a farm, however, his three friends grew up in the city."
60c729ef719e831b68527d87,5,"So, at times, his friends would go to the farm to be with him where they would go rabbit hunting."
60c729ef719e831b68527d87,6,"Hunting brought a lot of joy to his friends since they were city guys, but to him, there was nothing extraordinary about it since he'd grown up on a farm."
60c729ef719e831b68527d87,7,"So, they continued to do this for several years until one of his friends suggested that they go bear hunting."
60c729ef719e831b68527d87,8,"Although he wasn't too hyped up about this idea, he decided to go along."
60c729ef719e831b68527d87,9,"So, they flew to Canada, ended up on some lake, then hiked into the mountains until they reached the cabin where they would be staying."
60c729ef719e831b68527d87,10,"While there though, since it was quite spooky in the woods, his friends chickened out of bear hunting."
60c729ef719e831b68527d87,11,"So, they stayed in the cabin for a couple of days playing cards, eating and sleeping, but still just not being in the mood to go hunting for bears out of fear."
60c729ef719e831b68527d87,12,"However, one of the friends then said that there was no way that they could return back home without a bear otherwise they would be ridiculed."
60c729ef719e831b68527d87,13,"So, they decided that one of them would go hunt for the bear and the others would skin the bear and cut it into pieces."
60c729ef719e831b68527d87,14,"However, although the story-teller was still not super-stoked about this idea, sadly the bet fell on him to go out in the woods to hunt for the bear."
60c729ef719e831b68527d87,15,"So, he did and while in the woods, he encountered the biggest and oldest bear that he had ever seen."
60c729ef719e831b68527d87,16,"Sadly, he realised at he was about to shoot the bear that he had forgotten to load the rifle."
60c729ef719e831b68527d87,17,So he ran for his life back to the cabin screaming for his friends to open the door with the bear hot on his heels.
60c729ef719e831b68527d87,18,"As the door opened, he took a sharp left turn and the bear ran straight into the cabin."
60c729ef719e831b68527d87,19,Upon which he declared to his friends that he had done his part and brought the bear for them to skin...which they could not deny.
60c729ef719e831b68527d87,20,"The story concludes by saying that although this happened thirty years ago, none of his friends have ever suggested going bear-hunting again."
5def503a8ccc565e6e7dfeb6,1,"4 people became friends in 1949,"
5def503a8ccc565e6e7dfeb6,2,they had met before whilst in different schools as athletes.
5def503a8ccc565e6e7dfeb6,3,They became friends when they started going to the same school.
5def503a8ccc565e6e7dfeb6,4,The narrator friend grew up in a farm and the other 3 grew up in the city.
5def503a8ccc565e6e7dfeb6,5,The city friends were go to the farm and help out at times with the chores
5def503a8ccc565e6e7dfeb6,6,and they'd all go rabbit and squirrel hunting.
5def503a8ccc565e6e7dfeb6,7,"One friend suggested bear hunting,"
5def503a8ccc565e6e7dfeb6,8,which the narrator friend was not interested in.
5def503a8ccc565e6e7dfeb6,9,"However, not wanting to be the only one out, he agreed."
5def503a8ccc565e6e7dfeb6,10,"They went to the spot where they played cards, ate and slept."
5def503a8ccc565e6e7dfeb6,11,"They questioned bear hunting,"
5def503a8ccc565e6e7dfeb6,12,but one friend pointed out that they needed proof to show people back home.
5def503a8ccc565e6e7dfeb6,13,"After what seems to be peer pressure, the group agreed on a game where the loser would go and hunt the bear and bring it back."
5def503a8ccc565e6e7dfeb6,14,"Once back, the remaining friends would skin it and pack the bear to take home."
5def503a8ccc565e6e7dfeb6,15,"The narrator friend lost the game and went out,"
5def503a8ccc565e6e7dfeb6,16,he saw the bear and realised that the gun he had taken to shoot the bear wasn't loaded.
5def503a8ccc565e6e7dfeb6,17,"He realised this, when he pointed the gun and tried to shoot."
5def503a8ccc565e6e7dfeb6,18,He ran back to the cabin with the bear closing in.
5def503a8ccc565e6e7dfeb6,19,"Once he reached the cabin, he began screaming for the friends to open the door,"
5def503a8ccc565e6e7dfeb6,20,he went in and turned left and the bear followed.
5def503a8ccc565e6e7dfeb6,21,"He told his friends that his task was complete,"
5def503a8ccc565e6e7dfeb6,22,he had brought the bear to them as agreed and now they had to skin and pack it.
5def503a8ccc565e6e7dfeb6,23,He was never asked to bear hunt again.
63d79c0ca00135fc540fd236,1,He met his friends
63d79c0ca00135fc540fd236,2,"when they were in school,"
63d79c0ca00135fc540fd236,3,as they all played on the same athletics team.
63d79c0ca00135fc540fd236,4,They ended up going to college together
63d79c0ca00135fc540fd236,5,and became good friends.
63d79c0ca00135fc540fd236,6,One of them lived on a farm
63d79c0ca00135fc540fd236,7,"and the other three lived in the city,"
63d79c0ca00135fc540fd236,8,the city livers liked to visit the farm
63d79c0ca00135fc540fd236,9,"and go hunting,"
63d79c0ca00135fc540fd236,10,but the one who lived on the farm didn't like this.
656013477ede6fae3cc2728b,1,"A little before 1949, this man had three buddies he got close to in college."
656013477ede6fae3cc2728b,2,"Before, he was acquainted with them because they all went to separate high schools but were all athletes who saw each other in passing."
656013477ede6fae3cc2728b,3,"Anyway, they got close in college and the man lived on the farm and the other three lived in the city."
656013477ede6fae3cc2728b,4,"Because of this, the three would love to come to the farm and help the man do chores or do ""macho"" stuff like hunting."
656013477ede6fae3cc2728b,5,"They liked hunting squirrels and small things, but the man wasn't as interested because this was his regular life and it wasn't exciting."
656013477ede6fae3cc2728b,6,He went along with it because he wanted to be part of the group though.
656013477ede6fae3cc2728b,7,"Later on, maybe a couple of years, the three friends wanted to go on a hunting trip to hunt bear, and although the man wasn't that interested now either, he agreed to go for the same reason as before."
656013477ede6fae3cc2728b,8,"So, they all went to the northern woods where one of the friends rented a cabin."
656013477ede6fae3cc2728b,9,"On the journey, they encounter scary bears and the woods itself was scary, had to paddle for forever in kayaks, and when they got the cabin eventually they all decided to stay inside because they were spooked."
656013477ede6fae3cc2728b,10,"Inside they played card games and stuff, and near the end of the 3-4 day trip, they decided that because they told everyone back at home they'd catch a bear, then they needed to bring a bear back."
656013477ede6fae3cc2728b,11,They played a game to decide who would go out and shoot the bear and bring it back for the others to skin and pack.
656013477ede6fae3cc2728b,12,"Funnily, the farmer man who didn't even want to go in the first place got the short end of the stick."
656013477ede6fae3cc2728b,13,"He got a gun and went out though, as a man of his word."
656013477ede6fae3cc2728b,14,"He happened to come across a bear, but it was a HUGE bear."
656013477ede6fae3cc2728b,15,Bigger than anything the man's seen or heard of.
656013477ede6fae3cc2728b,16,"He tried to shoot it, but he realized he didn't load the gun."
656013477ede6fae3cc2728b,17,"So, the only thing he could do was run because now he's angered the bear."
656013477ede6fae3cc2728b,18,He ran with the bear hot on his heels and went back to the cabin screaming for his three friends to open the door.
656013477ede6fae3cc2728b,19,"They opened the door, he went inside, but the bear ended up following him in too."
656013477ede6fae3cc2728b,20,"The man told his friends 'alright, I brought the bear to you guys to skin and pack'."
656013477ede6fae3cc2728b,21,"It was a funny story and years later, his friends never invited him out to hunt again but knew he was a man of his word."
62ea84d41e834ec50d48fe99,1,The story is about four friends who went to the same college in 1949.
62ea84d41e834ec50d48fe99,2,They went to different high schools but had activities that made them acquainted.
62ea84d41e834ec50d48fe99,3,"The storyteller lived on the farm, while his three buddies lived in the city and they loved hunting and helping him with farm chores."
62ea84d41e834ec50d48fe99,4,"He wasn't a fan of hunting like the other guys were but always tagged along, from rabbit to squirrel hunting."
62ea84d41e834ec50d48fe99,5,"About thirty years ago, they decided to go bear hunting up in north woods in Canada."
62ea84d41e834ec50d48fe99,6,He was not happy to go with it but decided to.
62ea84d41e834ec50d48fe99,7,They were in a cabin for 3/4 days without wanting to go bear hunting because the area was so spooky.
62ea84d41e834ec50d48fe99,8,"Eventually, one of them psyched the boys to go bear hunting because everyone knew they had travelled to hunt for bears and it would be a bummer if they returned empty-handed."
62ea84d41e834ec50d48fe99,9,"So they drew cards to decide who would go, and it fell on the storyteller, who never wanted to be there in the first place."
62ea84d41e834ec50d48fe99,10,His role was to hunt for the bear while the others skinned and prepared the bear to be taken home.
62ea84d41e834ec50d48fe99,11,"As he went into the woods, he saw a big bear bigger than he had seen in pictures and tried to shoot at it."
62ea84d41e834ec50d48fe99,12,"Unfortunately, his gun was not loaded so nothing happened and immediately he ran towards the cabin, trying to get away from the bear."
62ea84d41e834ec50d48fe99,13,"The bear was very fast, and right behind his heel, even though he considered himself a fast runner."
62ea84d41e834ec50d48fe99,14,"As he approached the cabin, he shouted at his friends to open the cabin door and let him in, and just as he drew near the door, he swiftly turned left, letting the bear into the cabin."
62ea84d41e834ec50d48fe99,15,"He screamed, that he had fulfilled his role and it was left for his friends to skin and prep the bear."
666861d3a592871c05b6fa7f,1,Someone lived on a farm
666861d3a592871c05b6fa7f,2,and went hunting there
666861d3a592871c05b6fa7f,3,with their three friends
666861d3a592871c05b6fa7f,4,who they met during school.
666861d3a592871c05b6fa7f,5,"Their friends convinced them to go on a hunting trip,"
666861d3a592871c05b6fa7f,6,"even though they did not want to,"
666861d3a592871c05b6fa7f,7,"and they ended up getting attacked,"
666861d3a592871c05b6fa7f,8,but coming out of it alive.
60ab9e649e9587f020d43ede,1,4 friends who met in school decided to go bear hunting.
60ab9e649e9587f020d43ede,2,3 of the friends were into hunting
60ab9e649e9587f020d43ede,3,but the other friend who worked on a farm was not so keen on the idea
60ab9e649e9587f020d43ede,4,but the other friends encouraged him to come
60ab9e649e9587f020d43ede,5,and he eventually gave in.
60ab9e649e9587f020d43ede,6,When they got to the destination of the cabin they would be staying for the next 4 nights
60ab9e649e9587f020d43ede,7,they realised how spooky the woods were
60ab9e649e9587f020d43ede,8,and all decided they was no longer keen on the idea of bear hunting
60ab9e649e9587f020d43ede,9,so for three days then stayed in the cabin playing card games.
60ab9e649e9587f020d43ede,10,Then on the last day they decided they would need to go bear hunting
60ab9e649e9587f020d43ede,11,as they had told so many people
60ab9e649e9587f020d43ede,12,and if they came back empty handed they wouldn't hear the end of it.
60ab9e649e9587f020d43ede,13,They decided to cut the pack of cards
60ab9e649e9587f020d43ede,14,and whoever got the highest number would go a bring a bear back from them to skin and show the people back at home.
60ab9e649e9587f020d43ede,15,The friend who didn't want to go in the first place picked the highest card
60ab9e649e9587f020d43ede,16,and went out looking for the bear with the gun.
60ab9e649e9587f020d43ede,17,He was walking round and couldn't find anything
60ab9e649e9587f020d43ede,18,but then he heard a noise
60ab9e649e9587f020d43ede,19,and turned round and saw a big old bear the biggest he had ever seen.
60ab9e649e9587f020d43ede,20,The friend tried to shot the bear
60ab9e649e9587f020d43ede,21,but he realised he hadn't loaded the gun
60ab9e649e9587f020d43ede,22,so he ran back to the cabin as fast as he could
60ab9e649e9587f020d43ede,23,and the bear followed him.
60ab9e649e9587f020d43ede,24,When he got closer to the cabin he yelled for his friends to open up
60ab9e649e9587f020d43ede,25,and they did
60ab9e649e9587f020d43ede,26,and he ran in just as the bear ran in
60ab9e649e9587f020d43ede,27,and he told the friends that he had brought the bear
60ab9e649e9587f020d43ede,28,and that they could skin him.
60ab9e649e9587f020d43ede,29,He never got invited hunting with them again.
666aee2c8bf4c2b358481ce9,1,"1929, 4 students, athletic students all decide to go to a cabin in the woods to hunt some bears."
666aee2c8bf4c2b358481ce9,2,I'm not very keen but I go anyway.
666aee2c8bf4c2b358481ce9,3,When they get there the cabin is spooky so none of them want to hunt bears.
666aee2c8bf4c2b358481ce9,4,"In the end they decide that they have to bring a bear home as everyone at home is expecting a bear,"
666aee2c8bf4c2b358481ce9,5,so they all draw cards to find out who should do it.
666aee2c8bf4c2b358481ce9,6,"It ended up being me, who didnt even want to be there."
666aee2c8bf4c2b358481ce9,7,So off I went to hunt a bear -
666aee2c8bf4c2b358481ce9,8,the agreement was that I would hunt the bear and the others would skin and prepare the meat.
666aee2c8bf4c2b358481ce9,9,"I went out to find a bear but couldnt find any for a very long time,"
666aee2c8bf4c2b358481ce9,10,"then suddenly, there was one GIANT bear right behind me."
666aee2c8bf4c2b358481ce9,11,I lifted the shotgun and tried to fire it at the bear but I had forgotten to load it.
666aee2c8bf4c2b358481ce9,12,So I turned around and ran back to the cabin as fast as I could with the bear following close behind me.
666aee2c8bf4c2b358481ce9,13,"When I got to the cabin I yelled OPEN THE DOOR,"
666aee2c8bf4c2b358481ce9,14,"which they did,"
666aee2c8bf4c2b358481ce9,15,but then the bear ran past me and into the cabin.
666aee2c8bf4c2b358481ce9,16,"I took the opportunity to shut the door, trapping the bear inside,"
666aee2c8bf4c2b358481ce9,17,"and then I yelled: NOW GET TO SKINNING, I'M OFF TO GET ANOTHER ONE."
666aee2c8bf4c2b358481ce9,18,My friends all agreed that I had held up my end of the bargain.
5a63713163394a00015555aa,1,In 1949
5a63713163394a00015555aa,2,I was at high school
5a63713163394a00015555aa,3,and I met some friends.
5a63713163394a00015555aa,4,Then we went hunting
5a63713163394a00015555aa,5,for some bears
5a63713163394a00015555aa,6,in the woods.
5a63713163394a00015555aa,7,It is who you know
5a63713163394a00015555aa,8,and not what you know.
5a63713163394a00015555aa,9,The big bears came
5a63713163394a00015555aa,10,and they did scare me
5a63713163394a00015555aa,11,a little bit.
615033332cea99204ba90a95,1,There were 4 friends from college
615033332cea99204ba90a95,2,who knew each other from school sports
615033332cea99204ba90a95,3,but played in different schools.
615033332cea99204ba90a95,4,One of them lived on a farm
615033332cea99204ba90a95,5,and the other guys would come to the farm
615033332cea99204ba90a95,6,to do chores
615033332cea99204ba90a95,7,and go hunting.
615033332cea99204ba90a95,8,They would hunt for squirrels
615033332cea99204ba90a95,9,before one of them decided they wanted to go hunting for a bear.
615033332cea99204ba90a95,10,I didn't want to go
615033332cea99204ba90a95,11,but they talked me into taking a plane to Canada.
615033332cea99204ba90a95,12,We then canoeed for 1 and a half days to a cabin.
615033332cea99204ba90a95,13,We then got scared
615033332cea99204ba90a95,14,and didn't want to go bear hunting anymore
615033332cea99204ba90a95,15,but we were scared that people would talk bad about us
615033332cea99204ba90a95,16,if we didn't bring a bear back.
615033332cea99204ba90a95,17,We split a deck of cards
615033332cea99204ba90a95,18,to see who was going to go get a bear
615033332cea99204ba90a95,19,and then the others would skin it
615033332cea99204ba90a95,20,and cut it down.
615033332cea99204ba90a95,21,I drew the highest card
615033332cea99204ba90a95,22,and went out looking for a bear.
615033332cea99204ba90a95,23,I found the biggest bear I ever had seen
615033332cea99204ba90a95,24,and it started chasing me.
615033332cea99204ba90a95,25,It chased me all the way to the cabin
615033332cea99204ba90a95,26,and I started shouting to open the cabin door.
615033332cea99204ba90a95,27,When I reached the cabin
615033332cea99204ba90a95,28,I went left
615033332cea99204ba90a95,29,and the bear ran straight in.
615033332cea99204ba90a95,30,I slammed the door shut
615033332cea99204ba90a95,31,and shouted for them to skin the bear.
615033332cea99204ba90a95,32,Everyone agreed I had held my end of the deal
615033332cea99204ba90a95,33,but I never got invited on another hunting trip.
640612477c8f387ffe0b0dba,1,Four friends decided to go bear hunting
640612477c8f387ffe0b0dba,2,as they were quite outdoorsy
640612477c8f387ffe0b0dba,3,- except the guy who grew up on the farm.
640612477c8f387ffe0b0dba,4,He was hesitant
640612477c8f387ffe0b0dba,5,but got talked into going bear hunting up north in Canada.
640612477c8f387ffe0b0dba,6,"They took a flight,"
640612477c8f387ffe0b0dba,7,canoed
640612477c8f387ffe0b0dba,8,and hiked to get to the cabin they had rented.
640612477c8f387ffe0b0dba,9,Whole area was spooky
640612477c8f387ffe0b0dba,10,and none of them was as eager to go bear hunting as they had been before the trip.
640612477c8f387ffe0b0dba,11,"They stayed in the cabin for four days,"
640612477c8f387ffe0b0dba,12,playing cards
640612477c8f387ffe0b0dba,13,and rarely leaving the cabin.
640612477c8f387ffe0b0dba,14,"However, they thought other people, who they had told what they were about to do, would give them a hard time if they don't return with 'a catch'."
640612477c8f387ffe0b0dba,15,They drew cards
640612477c8f387ffe0b0dba,16,and farm guy got the highest card
640612477c8f387ffe0b0dba,17,- he had to go out and bring the bear back.
640612477c8f387ffe0b0dba,18,He forgot to load the gun
640612477c8f387ffe0b0dba,19,and bear charged towards him
640612477c8f387ffe0b0dba,20,but he made a lucky escape back to the cabin.
6662cbaedf0c993cd37ffb83,1,A guy is retelling a story of him and three friends back in 1949.
6662cbaedf0c993cd37ffb83,2,"They had all met before this,"
6662cbaedf0c993cd37ffb83,3,they were athletes that became acquainted.
6662cbaedf0c993cd37ffb83,4,After they graduated they ended up at the same school
6662cbaedf0c993cd37ffb83,5,and became good friends.
6662cbaedf0c993cd37ffb83,6,"The protagonist lived on a farm,"
6662cbaedf0c993cd37ffb83,7,and the friends used to come up to the farm to hunt.
6662cbaedf0c993cd37ffb83,8,"The protagonist didn't like hunting much,"
6662cbaedf0c993cd37ffb83,9,"but the other three did,"
6662cbaedf0c993cd37ffb83,10,so he indulged them.
6662cbaedf0c993cd37ffb83,11,"One day, the three friends said they would like to go hunting bears in Canada."
6662cbaedf0c993cd37ffb83,12,The protagonist couldn't think of a good excuse not to go
6662cbaedf0c993cd37ffb83,13,so they agreed.
6662cbaedf0c993cd37ffb83,14,They flew out of Fort Wayne
6662cbaedf0c993cd37ffb83,15,and landed up in Canada on the water.
6662cbaedf0c993cd37ffb83,16,"They holed up in a cabin in the north woods,"
6662cbaedf0c993cd37ffb83,17,where they discussed the idea of hunting bears.
6662cbaedf0c993cd37ffb83,18,"They all decided that it was not something they actually wanted to do any more because of fear,"
6662cbaedf0c993cd37ffb83,19,"but they were worried if they returned without a trophy bear, people would think less of them."
6662cbaedf0c993cd37ffb83,20,They decided to split a deck of cards
6662cbaedf0c993cd37ffb83,21,and whoever drew the high card would hunt the bear
6662cbaedf0c993cd37ffb83,22,and the others would butcher and skin it.
6662cbaedf0c993cd37ffb83,23,"The protagonist drew the high card,"
6662cbaedf0c993cd37ffb83,24,and ended up going out on the hunt.
6662cbaedf0c993cd37ffb83,25,"When he encountered the bear it took him by surprise,"
6662cbaedf0c993cd37ffb83,26,as it was much larger than expected.
6662cbaedf0c993cd37ffb83,27,He had not even seen a picture of a bear that size.
6662cbaedf0c993cd37ffb83,28,"He aimed the gun,"
6662cbaedf0c993cd37ffb83,29,"but it didn't fire,"
6662cbaedf0c993cd37ffb83,30,because he forgot to load it.
6662cbaedf0c993cd37ffb83,31,"At this time, he decided to make a run for it back to the cabin."
6662cbaedf0c993cd37ffb83,32,Once he got back he closed the door behind him.
6662cbaedf0c993cd37ffb83,33,"He reminisced that since this encounter, he had not been invited back on any more hunting trips."
6662cbaedf0c993cd37ffb83,34,The story was being remembered 30 years after it happened.
6688000c0fc9f75d8caefc4f,1,It is a story about three friends
6688000c0fc9f75d8caefc4f,2,that I met in 1949
6688000c0fc9f75d8caefc4f,3,when I started college.
6688000c0fc9f75d8caefc4f,4,"Actually I met them before that,"
6688000c0fc9f75d8caefc4f,5,we became friends
6688000c0fc9f75d8caefc4f,6,after we all... went to school at the same place.
6688000c0fc9f75d8caefc4f,7,Previous to that during high school
6688000c0fc9f75d8caefc4f,8,"we'd all been school athletes at different schools,"
6688000c0fc9f75d8caefc4f,9,and so we were acquainted.
6688000c0fc9f75d8caefc4f,10,But then after graduation
6688000c0fc9f75d8caefc4f,11,"after we all enrolled in school,"
6688000c0fc9f75d8caefc4f,12,"we found that the four of us were all now attending the same school,"
6688000c0fc9f75d8caefc4f,13,and became quite good friends.
6688000c0fc9f75d8caefc4f,14,"I was the kid from the farm,"
6688000c0fc9f75d8caefc4f,15,the other three guys all lived in the city.
6688000c0fc9f75d8caefc4f,16,"So being big macho men that we all were,"
6688000c0fc9f75d8caefc4f,17,"they used to come out to the farm and hunt,"
6688000c0fc9f75d8caefc4f,18,"and they'd come out,"
6688000c0fc9f75d8caefc4f,19,and help me do chores and things like that.
6688000c0fc9f75d8caefc4f,20,Then we'd go rabbit hunting and squirrel hunting and things of that nature.
6688000c0fc9f75d8caefc4f,21,I never really enjoyed hunting.
6688000c0fc9f75d8caefc4f,22,Uh... being born and raised.
65391d8a5a2723f92006e284,1,Group of friends were acquaintances in high school.
65391d8a5a2723f92006e284,2,They were athletes at different high schools.
65391d8a5a2723f92006e284,3,In 1949 they went to college
65391d8a5a2723f92006e284,4,and became great friends.
65391d8a5a2723f92006e284,5,They used to hang out at the writer's family farm.
65391d8a5a2723f92006e284,6,The other 3 were city kids
65391d8a5a2723f92006e284,7,and loved the farm.
65391d8a5a2723f92006e284,8,They used to hunt
65391d8a5a2723f92006e284,9,but the writer didn't like it.
65391d8a5a2723f92006e284,10,Once they went to Canada
65391d8a5a2723f92006e284,11,wanting to hunt bears.
65391d8a5a2723f92006e284,12,They all decided once there
65391d8a5a2723f92006e284,13,they didn't really want to
65391d8a5a2723f92006e284,14,so sat around for 3 or 4 days playing cards.
65391d8a5a2723f92006e284,15,They decided they should find a bear
65391d8a5a2723f92006e284,16,because they didn't want to be teased when they got home.
65391d8a5a2723f92006e284,17,The writer found one
65391d8a5a2723f92006e284,18,"and was chased by it,"
65391d8a5a2723f92006e284,19,he lead it back to the cabin.
65391d8a5a2723f92006e284,20,He never went hunting with his friends again.
6319ff03df1e7848122f18b1,1,The story was involving a bear
6319ff03df1e7848122f18b1,2,in which many different events took place involving the bear.
6319ff03df1e7848122f18b1,3,It ended up being the bear being skinned
6319ff03df1e7848122f18b1,4,after being chased by the bear
6319ff03df1e7848122f18b1,5,and slamming a door shut.
6319ff03df1e7848122f18b1,6,By shutting the door shut
6319ff03df1e7848122f18b1,7,they managed to escape the bear.
6319ff03df1e7848122f18b1,8,The bear was ferocious
6319ff03df1e7848122f18b1,9,and would not give in.
6319ff03df1e7848122f18b1,10,The people being attacked by the bear
6319ff03df1e7848122f18b1,11,eventually defeated the bear
6319ff03df1e7848122f18b1,12,and skinned it.
66880d5992fc91de8ff934bc,1,There were a group of 4 friends
66880d5992fc91de8ff934bc,2,that become close
66880d5992fc91de8ff934bc,3,and one of them lived in a farm
66880d5992fc91de8ff934bc,4,while others lived in the city.
66880d5992fc91de8ff934bc,5,So the other city friends loved to come hunting in the farm
66880d5992fc91de8ff934bc,6,with their friend who lives there.
66880d5992fc91de8ff934bc,7,And although he hates hunting
66880d5992fc91de8ff934bc,8,he always accompanies his friends while they hunt.
66880d5992fc91de8ff934bc,9,And years passed
66880d5992fc91de8ff934bc,10,then one day they suggested they go Bear hunting in Canada
66880d5992fc91de8ff934bc,11,and even though he hates the idea
66880d5992fc91de8ff934bc,12,he still allowed his friends to talk him into doing it.
66880d5992fc91de8ff934bc,13,They travelled and lodged in a spooky old cabin for days
66880d5992fc91de8ff934bc,14,as they did not feel the need to go bear hunting anymore
66880d5992fc91de8ff934bc,15,"and one day while they were playing cards,"
66880d5992fc91de8ff934bc,16,they decided to play a game to choose who will go bear hunting
66880d5992fc91de8ff934bc,17,and deliver the bear to the others to skin and take back to the city.
66880d5992fc91de8ff934bc,18,Unluckily he was picked
66880d5992fc91de8ff934bc,19,"and he went out looking for a bear,"
66880d5992fc91de8ff934bc,20,he spotted one big old Bear
66880d5992fc91de8ff934bc,21,and just when he wanted to shoot
66880d5992fc91de8ff934bc,22,he realised he did not load his gun
66880d5992fc91de8ff934bc,23,and so the Bear chased him all the way to the cabin
66880d5992fc91de8ff934bc,24,and when he was near he screamed to be let in.
66880d5992fc91de8ff934bc,25,The story ended with them agreeing that he did part of his bargain by bringing the Bear to them
66880d5992fc91de8ff934bc,26,and they had the choice to skin the bear.
60b8e84804e38fb3c6b5b153,1,A guy got acquainted with three friends in high school in 1949.
60b8e84804e38fb3c6b5b153,2,After graduation they also attended the same school and became good friends.
60b8e84804e38fb3c6b5b153,3,He was from the farm and the three were macho men from the city.
60b8e84804e38fb3c6b5b153,4,They liked visiting him on the farm to hunt and help him with chores.
60b8e84804e38fb3c6b5b153,5,They used to hunt rabbit and squirrels and others.
60b8e84804e38fb3c6b5b153,6,He didn't enjoy it but did it to be part of their group.
60b8e84804e38fb3c6b5b153,7,"After several years of being friends and hunting, one of them wanted to go hunting in Canada."
60b8e84804e38fb3c6b5b153,8,He didn't like it but was talked into it by them.
60b8e84804e38fb3c6b5b153,9,"So they took an airplane and flew into Canada, landed on a lake and rented Canoes."
60b8e84804e38fb3c6b5b153,10,They went deep in the canoes and had to backpack for about 500 miles.
60b8e84804e38fb3c6b5b153,11,They got a cabin in the woods and he was spooked by the place.
60b8e84804e38fb3c6b5b153,12,They set up the cabin and packed their groceries.
60b8e84804e38fb3c6b5b153,13,They sat around for three or four days playing cards and ate.
60b8e84804e38fb3c6b5b153,14,They weren't in the mood to go out hunting.
60b8e84804e38fb3c6b5b153,15,One of them talked about going to hunt for a bear to take home or people would give them a bad time.
60b8e84804e38fb3c6b5b153,16,They made a pact to cut the cards and whoever got the high card would go hunting for the bear.
60b8e84804e38fb3c6b5b153,17,The guy from the farm got the high card and he had to take the gun and go out there in the woods.
60b8e84804e38fb3c6b5b153,18,"He saw the biggest bear he had ever seen, tried to shoot it and nothing happened."
60b8e84804e38fb3c6b5b153,19,He started running with the bear right on his heels.
60b8e84804e38fb3c6b5b153,20,"When he was about to get to the cabin he started yelling for the others to open the door for him, they did and he got in and the bear was with him."
60b8e84804e38fb3c6b5b153,21,He told them to skin it while he goes to get another one.
60b8e84804e38fb3c6b5b153,22,It happened 30 years ago and his friends agreed he lived up to his promise but they never asked him to go hunting since then.
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,1,I met my friends at College in 1949
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,2,but we knew each other before then.
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,3,"There's 4 of us,"
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,4,some from school
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,5,and some acquaintances
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,6,but since graduation have all remained friends.
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,7,Being the lads that we are
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,8,we all liked to hunt
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,9,and would go dear and rabbit hunting and the like.
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,10,I grew up on a farm
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,11,and it didn't appeal to me
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,12,but I'd go along with it for my friends.
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,13,"One day, as we were deciding to meet up,"
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,14,they all decided that it would be fun to go bear hunting
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,15,and find a cabin in Canada.
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,16,The travel was hard going
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,17,to when we eventually got there
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,18,we decided to not bother finding any bears
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,19,and just hang out in the cabin.
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,20,Then one of them got the idea that if we went back home not having hunted a bear we'd be skunked.
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,21,None of us wanted to go out
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,22,so we decided that we would draw cards
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,23,and whoever got the worse deal would go out
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,24,whilst the others stayed back
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,25,and who did it end up being?
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,26,"Me, so I went off into the woods to look for a bear."
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,27,Then I came across one
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,28,and I ran back towards the cabin as fast as I could.
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,29,I was sure I was a better runner than that
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,30,but that bear was gaining up on me.
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,31,As soon as I saw the cabin I called out to open the door
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,32,"and as soon as I reached it,"
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,33,I got in and turned left pulling the door to me
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,34,"and shouted 'There, I got the bear, you can skin it'."
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,35,They have never let me forget it since
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,36,"but then, none of us have ever wanted to go bear hunting after that."
66a2ba211e0d673905b1db03,1,"The man was an high school athlete,"
66a2ba211e0d673905b1db03,2,and was acquainted with some other high school athletes.
66a2ba211e0d673905b1db03,3,"After high school, they found themselves attending the same college"
66a2ba211e0d673905b1db03,4,and became friends.
66a2ba211e0d673905b1db03,5,He was from the farm
66a2ba211e0d673905b1db03,6,while the other three were from the city.
66a2ba211e0d673905b1db03,7,"Over the years, they came down to the farm to do some hunting."
66a2ba211e0d673905b1db03,8,"The man wasn't really a big fan of hunting because he grew up outdoors,"
66a2ba211e0d673905b1db03,9,"but to the rest of them, it was a lot of fun."
66a2ba211e0d673905b1db03,10,"One day, the three friends brought a suggestion to go bear hunting in Canada."
66a2ba211e0d673905b1db03,11,The man did not want to but he let them talk him into it.
66a2ba211e0d673905b1db03,12,"They packed up, took a flight up to Canada."
66a2ba211e0d673905b1db03,13,"They landed on a lake, paddled in a canoe for what seemed like a day and a half,"
66a2ba211e0d673905b1db03,14,and then hiked what seemed like 500 miles before arriving at a cabin in the woods that they had rented.
66a2ba211e0d673905b1db03,15,"Upon settling down in the cabin, they all decided that they weren't exactly hyped up about going bear hunting."
66a2ba211e0d673905b1db03,16,"So for the next three or four days, they stayed indoors, played card games, and ate."
66a2ba211e0d673905b1db03,17,"On the third or fourth day, one of them brought it up that they had to get a bear so as not to disappoint the people waiting for them back at home."
66a2ba211e0d673905b1db03,18,"To decide who goes out to hunt the bear, they drew cards."
66a2ba211e0d673905b1db03,19,"The person with the highest card had to go hunt the bear,"
66a2ba211e0d673905b1db03,20,while the others would skin it and prepare it for travel.
66a2ba211e0d673905b1db03,21,"After they drew cards, it turned out it was the man who did not even want to go in the first place that got the highest card."
66a2ba211e0d673905b1db03,22,He took the old gun and set out.
66a2ba211e0d673905b1db03,23,"After what seemed like hours, he heard a growl behind"
66a2ba211e0d673905b1db03,24,and looked back to see the biggest bear he had ever seen in his life.
66a2ba211e0d673905b1db03,25,"He picked up the gun and fired, but nothing happened."
66a2ba211e0d673905b1db03,26,Turned out he had forgotten to load the gun.
66a2ba211e0d673905b1db03,27,"He turned on his heels and started running as fast as he could, with the bear on his heels."
66a2ba211e0d673905b1db03,28,"When he got in sight of the cabin, he started shouting for them to open the door."
66a2ba211e0d673905b1db03,29,"The door opened, but instead of going in, he took a left around the cabin,"
66a2ba211e0d673905b1db03,30,while the bear went straight inside.
66a2ba211e0d673905b1db03,31,He quickly closed the cabin door
66a2ba211e0d673905b1db03,32,"and told his friends that he had brought the bear, it was their turn to skin it."
66a2ba211e0d673905b1db03,33,"Eventually, they agreed that he actually played his part."
66a2ba211e0d673905b1db03,34,"Although this happened 30 years ago, they never asked him to go hunting since that day."
5a9d223b89de8200013f1893,1,I met three friends in 1949 at college.
5a9d223b89de8200013f1893,2,We had been to the same primary school but went to different high schools.
5a9d223b89de8200013f1893,3,"We had all been athletes, so bonded at college over this."
5a9d223b89de8200013f1893,4,I had grown up on a farm but the other three guys were city folk.
5a9d223b89de8200013f1893,5,They loved to come out to the farm and help with chores and to go hunting rabbits and squirrels and be in nature.
5a9d223b89de8200013f1893,6,I wasn't keen on hunting but wanted to be part of group and it made the guys happy.
5a9d223b89de8200013f1893,7,"After several years, the guys said they would love to go on a bear hunt and told everyone we were going."
5a9d223b89de8200013f1893,8,I didn't want to but went along with it.
5a9d223b89de8200013f1893,9,"We took a plane from Fort Wayne up to Canada and then canoes in to the North Woods, we had to back pack for 500 miles."
5a9d223b89de8200013f1893,10,Finally we got to a cabin where we had had groceries and stuff delivered.
5a9d223b89de8200013f1893,11,It was really spooky in the cabin and we were all spooked about going out day or night.
5a9d223b89de8200013f1893,12,So we sat around playing cards and not being able to sleep.
5a9d223b89de8200013f1893,13,The others felt we would lose face if we didn't come back with a bear so we drew cards and the person with the high card had to go hunt a bear.
5a9d223b89de8200013f1893,14,Wouldn't you know it!
5a9d223b89de8200013f1893,15,I got the high card and had to go out with the shotgun.
5a9d223b89de8200013f1893,16,I was in the woods for hours but there was no sign of a bear.
5a9d223b89de8200013f1893,17,I heard a noise and turned around and saw a big old bear.
5a9d223b89de8200013f1893,18,I had never seen one so big.
5a9d223b89de8200013f1893,19,"I pulled the trigger on the gun, but I had forgotten to load it!"
5a9d223b89de8200013f1893,20,"The bear started to run at me so I ran as fast as I could, with the bear on my tail all the way back to the cabin."
5a9d223b89de8200013f1893,21,"I shouted ""Open the door, open the door!"" and the guys opened the door and as I reached it I turned right and the bear ran in the cabin and I shouted you guys can skin him!"
5a9d223b89de8200013f1893,22,The guys never asked me to go hunting again.
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,1,There was a guy
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,2,that was friends with 4 people in college.
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,3,He was from a farm
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,4,while the other 3 were from the city.
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,5,So The city ones were really fascinated by the outdoors
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,6,"because they havent really experianced it much before,"
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,7,but as for our main character from the farm
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,8,he had enough the outdoors.
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,9,But after being apart of the group for so long
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,10,the 3 city ones wanted to try hunting.
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,11,The farm guy did not like the idea too much
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,12,and didnt like it even more when he figured out they wanted to go bear hunting in canada.
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,13,He didnt back out of going though
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,14,because he couldnt find a reason to say no.
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,15,So the four of them end up going to Canada to try bear hunting.
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,16,After driving for as long as they could drive to get to their destination
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,17,the road ends.
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,18,They have to backpack what feels like 500miles to get to the cabin they were going to be staying at.
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,19,But when everyone gets there its really spooky.
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,20,The cabin is old
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,21,and they are in the middle of no where.
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,22,So instead of bear hunting the 4 guys decide to stay in the cabin and play card games for 4 days.
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,23,They did not go outside at nighttime
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,24,and hunkered down in the cabin.
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,25,"After 3-4 days though someone says ""people back home are going to real mean to us if we don't come back with a bear, because they all know that were going bear hunting out in the forest""."
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,26,So the group of friends decide that they need to get a bear.
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,27,But because none of them want to they play a card game for it.
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,28,The loser would have to get the bear
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,29,and the winners would have to skin butcher and bag the bear meat.
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,30,Our main character the one that didnt even want to be there in the first place loses
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,31,and has to go hunt a bear.
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,32,So he sets out to find a bear in the forest.
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,33,He spends hours out there looking for this bear
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,34,but cant find anything.
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,35,Eventually he turns around
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,36,and sees a huge bear directly behind him.
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,37,A bear bigger than any bear he has ever seen before even in pictures.
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,38,"So he immediately tries to shoot the bear,"
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,39,but he forgot to load his gun.
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,40,So in panic the only thing he can do is run.
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,41,He starts running as fast as he could.
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,42,He recalls being a fast runner in the past
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,43,but the old bear is still gaining on him.
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,44,As he is getting closer to the cabin where everyone else is
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,45,"he yells ""OPEN THE DOOR, OPEN DOOR""."
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,46,The other guys open the door for him
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,47,and he rushes inside
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,48,and close the door behind him
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,49,locking the bear out
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,50,"and says, ""Well I brought you guys the bear, you better get to skinning""."
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,51,After 30 years the 3 guys still say he completed his task of bringing a bear back.
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,52,But for some reason they never invited him to go hunting again.
66884e1b52a01d16fe557350,1,A boy met his group of friends in 1949.
66884e1b52a01d16fe557350,2,They grew up on a farm.
66884e1b52a01d16fe557350,3,His friends were interested in hunting.
66884e1b52a01d16fe557350,4,He was not.
66884e1b52a01d16fe557350,5,They invited him on a trip to Canada to go hunting bears.
66884e1b52a01d16fe557350,6,He reluctantly agreed.
66884e1b52a01d16fe557350,7,He went with them.
66884e1b52a01d16fe557350,8,They hired canoes.
66884e1b52a01d16fe557350,9,They spent days in an old cabin.
66884e1b52a01d16fe557350,10,They were scared to hunt for bears.
66884e1b52a01d16fe557350,11,They did not want to go home empty-handed.
66884e1b52a01d16fe557350,12,"After a few days, they went out to hunt them."
66884e1b52a01d16fe557350,13,The boy found a bear.
66884e1b52a01d16fe557350,14,He tried to shoot it.
66884e1b52a01d16fe557350,15,His gun wouldn't fire.
66884e1b52a01d16fe557350,16,The bear chased him.
66884e1b52a01d16fe557350,17,"After this adventure, his friends never invited him to hunt again."
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,1,"This is a story from 1949,"
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,2,about me and my friends in graduate school.
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,3,I knew them before joining graduate school.
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,4,We knew each other as we took part in sporting events.
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,5,"When we joined Graduate school,"
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,6,we found out we were all in the same school
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,7,and got to know each other better.
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,8,I grew up in a farm and from a village
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,9,while the other three were from the city.
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,10,We used to go hunting while we were free
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,11,and they used to come to my farm and hunt rabbits and squirrels.
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,12,"I was not very interested as it was not new for me,"
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,13,but they really enjoyed it.
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,14,Once they mentioned they were all done with rabbit hunting
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,15,and we should go bear hunting.
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,16,"I was not hepped up about it,"
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,17,but since I was part of the group I let them talk me into it.
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,18,So we flew out of the airport from Fort Wayne
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,19,into some part of Canada
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,20,and landed on a lake.
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,21,"From there, we went hiking for about 500 miles into the north woods."
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,22,We had to reach a cabin where we would stay.
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,23,We reached the cabin
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,24,and it was a spooky place.
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,25,We did not go bear hunting
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,26,and all for three days was play cards and drink.
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,27,After 3 days one of the friends said we need to go bear hunting
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,28,as many people from our place knew we had gone to hunt a bear
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,29,and if we returned empty handed it would not be good for us.
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,30,so we need to get a bear
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,31,and either hunt it or take one back to our place.
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,32,I was not interested to go.
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,33,It was decided to play a game of cards
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,34,and whoever had the highest number at the end of the game would go to hunt the bear
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,35,and the other three will stay and do the skinning and cutting the meat so it can be taken back with us.
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,36,So the card game started
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,37,and guess who had the highest card!
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,38,the one who was least interested in hunting the bear.
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,39,"Yes, then I picked up a gun"
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,40,and left to hunt the bear on my own.
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,41,"I kept walking but there was nothing to be found,"
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,42,"after quite a while, I heard a noise,"
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,43,when I went to check I saw the biggest old bear I had ever seen in my life.
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,44,It did not look happy to see me in its territory.
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,45,"I took out the gun, aimed to shoot,"
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,46,"when I pressed the trigger nothing happened,"
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,47,I realised the gun was not loaded
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,48,and made a run for it.
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,49,"I ran as hard as I could,"
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,50,"but the bear was closing in on my heels,"
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,51,"after coming out of the woods, I could see the cabin"
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,52,and I shouted OPEN THE DOOR! OPEN THE DOOR!
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,53,as I reached the door and turned left and closed the door.
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,54,"I shouted to my friends, I got the bear its outside,"
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,55,now go and skin it and cut the meat out of it.
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,56,Its been 30 years since that happened
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,57,and after that incident.
6022dfbafb748f0ca0385db9,1,The story is about 4 friends
6022dfbafb748f0ca0385db9,2,who became close in college
6022dfbafb748f0ca0385db9,3,but knew each other before that
6022dfbafb748f0ca0385db9,4,because they were acquaintances.
6022dfbafb748f0ca0385db9,5,They later became best friends in college.
6022dfbafb748f0ca0385db9,6,The one telling the story is a farm boy
6022dfbafb748f0ca0385db9,7,"while the others do not so much,"
6022dfbafb748f0ca0385db9,8,they used to come and help him with his farm chores
6022dfbafb748f0ca0385db9,9,and seemed to enjoy the farm life.
6022dfbafb748f0ca0385db9,10,One day they decided they wanted to go hunting
6022dfbafb748f0ca0385db9,11,"not just hunting but bear hunting,"
6022dfbafb748f0ca0385db9,12,the farm boy was not so fond of hunting
6022dfbafb748f0ca0385db9,13,but because he is a people pleaser agreed to go with the team.
6022dfbafb748f0ca0385db9,14,They packed their bags
6022dfbafb748f0ca0385db9,15,"and headed over to a cabin that seemed a couple of days away,"
6022dfbafb748f0ca0385db9,16,they had to canoe up there
6022dfbafb748f0ca0385db9,17,eventually they arrived.
6022dfbafb748f0ca0385db9,18,"Luckily for Farm Boy the other guys also did not feel like bear hunting when they got to the cabin,"
6022dfbafb748f0ca0385db9,19,all they did was eat and sleep.
6022dfbafb748f0ca0385db9,20,Until one day they decided they had to take home a bear to show the other people that they went hunting to save their reputation.
6022dfbafb748f0ca0385db9,21,It was decided to make a draw
6022dfbafb748f0ca0385db9,22,and farm boy was the one who won the card to go hunting.
6022dfbafb748f0ca0385db9,23,He went hunting with his gun
6022dfbafb748f0ca0385db9,24,and sat out for almost an entire day without seeing a bear
6022dfbafb748f0ca0385db9,25,when eventually the biggest bear he ever saw appeared behind him.
6022dfbafb748f0ca0385db9,26,He tried to draw his gun
6022dfbafb748f0ca0385db9,27,"but he had not loaded it,"
6022dfbafb748f0ca0385db9,28,the bear started chasing him
6022dfbafb748f0ca0385db9,29,and it was swift.
6022dfbafb748f0ca0385db9,30,He eventually saw the cabin
6022dfbafb748f0ca0385db9,31,and started shouting they must open.
6022dfbafb748f0ca0385db9,32,"Which they did,"
6022dfbafb748f0ca0385db9,33,however instead of going in he swung to the right
6022dfbafb748f0ca0385db9,34,and the bear went right inside.
6022dfbafb748f0ca0385db9,35,He closed the door
6022dfbafb748f0ca0385db9,36,and said the guys got their bear
6022dfbafb748f0ca0385db9,37,and they must deal with it.
6022dfbafb748f0ca0385db9,38,This was 30yrs ago
6022dfbafb748f0ca0385db9,39,and the guys never asked him to go hunting again.
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,1,"In 1949 I had 3 friends in college,"
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,2,we met in school as we were all athletes
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,3,and then we all enrolled in the same school.
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,4,I was from a farm
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,5,and they were all from the city.
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,6,They used to love to come down to the farm
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,7,and hunt
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,8,and help me with chores.
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,9,I wasn't into hunting all that much
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,10,but I would join in to be a part of the group.
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,11,"One day they decided they wanted to hunt bear in Canada,"
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,12,I didn't want to do this
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,13,but I was a part of the group.
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,14,So we went deep into Canada
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,15,and had to trek another 500 miles to get to the cabin.
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,16,"This place was spooky,"
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,17,"we didn't want to hunt the bear once we got there,"
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,18,so for about 3 or 4 days we just sat around the cabin playing cards and stuff.
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,19,We said we had to hunt the bear though
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,20,as the people at home would give us a hard time if we didn't come home with a bear
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,21,as many people knew we went out hunting for a bear.
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,22,So we agreed that whoever got a high card would have to go out and find the bear.
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,23,Of course it was me who had to go and hunt the bear
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,24,while the fellas would skin and pack the bear.
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,25,"For hours I was searching in the forest for the bear,"
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,26,then I heard a noise
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,27,and it was behind me.
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,28,"The biggest bear I have ever seen,"
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,29,not even the pictures had them this big.
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,30,So I pointed my gun at him
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,31,and pulled the trigger.
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,32,"Nothing happened,"
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,33,I forgot the load this turkey.
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,34,"So I ran,"
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,35,I thought I was fast
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,36,but this bear was gaining on me.
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,37,When he was on my heels
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,38,I could see the cabin
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,39,"and I shouted ""open the door!""."
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,40,That was 30 years ago
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,41,and those fellas have never asked me to come hunting.
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,1,"I have 3 friends that I met in college,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,2,"actually I met them before,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,3,"in high school in 1949,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,4,"because we were high schools athletes so we were acquainted before college,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,5,"then we met each other at college,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,6,so we became good friends.
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,7,"I grew up in a farm but they were from the city,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,8,"so us being big macho guys we'd go hunting where I used to live,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,9,"I never really liked it,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,10,but I wanted to be part of the group so I went a long.
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,11,"We used to go squirrel hunting, rabbet hunting..."
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,12,"they used to really get a kick out of it,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,13,but I didn't.
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,14,One time one of my friends said that we should go bear hunting up in Canada.
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,15,"I really didn't want to go,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,16,but they talked me into it.
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,17,"I didn't really have a reason to not go and I let them talk me into it,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,18,so we went.
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,19,"We flew to Canada through New Fryer,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,20,"we got there,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,21,"from there we went with canons up a lake,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,22,"where we rented an old cabin,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,23,"we got there,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,24,"stored away our groceries,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,25,"and settled down,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,26,"no one was really in the mood to go out hunting, neither was I."
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,27,"So we played card games, ate."
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,28,We stayed like that for 3 or 4 days.
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,29,"At day 3, someone said that we have to go hunting,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,30,"because so many people know we're here, we can't come back without a bear."
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,31,"So we made a deal that who ever will get the upper card, in the card games we we're playing will need to go hunt the bear alone,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,32,"and the others will skim him, butcher, pack him home."
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,33,Guess who got the upper card? me!
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,34,So I had to go because I agreed to play the game.
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,35,"Here I went to go hunting for a bear,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,36,"I looked for hours and didn't find anything,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,37,"till I heard I noise behind me,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,38,"I turn around and there is the biggest bear I ever saw in my  life,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,39,bigger than any bear I ever saw in a photo.
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,40,"I whipped out my gun to shoot the bear,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,41,"but nothing happed,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,42,I FORGIT TO LOAD MY GUN!!!
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,43,"I turned around and started running,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,44,"I thought I was fast,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,45,"but the bear was on my heels the whole time,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,46,"till I got close to the cabin,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,47,"I whipped as loud as I can :""THE BEAR IS HERE!!!"""
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,48,"they opened the door and I turned to the right,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,49,and got into the cabin.
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,50,"They took the bear and skimmed it and wrapped it and brought it home,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,51,"this happed 30 years ago,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,52,"but till this day mu friends don't mention hunting to me,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,53,they know better.
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,54,That is my story.
5e12603776c03b8d43b40747,1,"The narrator was acquaintances with 3 other people he knew in high school athletics,"
5e12603776c03b8d43b40747,2,and became much friendlier and closer to them when they went to the same college beginning in 1949.
5e12603776c03b8d43b40747,3,The narrator was from a farm
5e12603776c03b8d43b40747,4,and the other 3 were from the city
5e12603776c03b8d43b40747,5,and were interested in farm life.
5e12603776c03b8d43b40747,6,They would visit the narrator's farm
5e12603776c03b8d43b40747,7,and help with farm work
5e12603776c03b8d43b40747,8,and then hunt rabbits and squirrels.
5e12603776c03b8d43b40747,9,The narrator wasn't interested in hunting
5e12603776c03b8d43b40747,10,but went along with it as the rest of the group were interested.
5e12603776c03b8d43b40747,11,Eventually one of the group decided they should go bear hunting.
5e12603776c03b8d43b40747,12,They got a plane to Fort Wayne
5e12603776c03b8d43b40747,13,and then another plane into Canada
5e12603776c03b8d43b40747,14,"where they landed on a lake,"
5e12603776c03b8d43b40747,15,canoed for a day and a half
5e12603776c03b8d43b40747,16,and hiked what the narrator believed to be 500 miles to the cabin they had rented.
5e12603776c03b8d43b40747,17,"When they got there, it was so remote and spooky that none of them wanted to go hunting."
5e12603776c03b8d43b40747,18,"They stayed in the cabin, ate, slept and played cards"
5e12603776c03b8d43b40747,19,until one of the group decided they had to go home with proof they had hunted a bear
5e12603776c03b8d43b40747,20,or else they would be teased for not going through with it.
5e12603776c03b8d43b40747,21,They decided to play a game
5e12603776c03b8d43b40747,22,and whoever got the high card from the deck would go out and hunt the bear
5e12603776c03b8d43b40747,23,while the others would skin it and prepare it for being brought home.
5e12603776c03b8d43b40747,24,The narrator drew the high card
5e12603776c03b8d43b40747,25,and went out to hunt a bear.
5e12603776c03b8d43b40747,26,After walking through the woods he came upon a huge old bear.
5e12603776c03b8d43b40747,27,This bear was bigger than even any picture of a bear the narrator had ever seen.
5e12603776c03b8d43b40747,28,"He took aim with his gun,"
5e12603776c03b8d43b40747,29,pulled the trigger
5e12603776c03b8d43b40747,30,but nothing happened.
5e12603776c03b8d43b40747,31,He had forgotten to load the gun.
5e12603776c03b8d43b40747,32,So he started running back towards the cabin
5e12603776c03b8d43b40747,33,and as he neared it he started shouting to his friends to open the door
5e12603776c03b8d43b40747,34,which they did.
5e12603776c03b8d43b40747,35,The narrator ran inside
5e12603776c03b8d43b40747,36,and told his friends that he got the bear
5e12603776c03b8d43b40747,37,and now it was their turn to skin him!
5e12603776c03b8d43b40747,38,They've never gone hunting since in the intervening 30 years.
66783c88377bdf2f569885f9,1,A group of guys who grew up together in the same neighborhood and have been friends since childhood reunited in school and decided to go on an adventure.
66783c88377bdf2f569885f9,2,Bear hunting!
66783c88377bdf2f569885f9,3,The story teller lived in the rural and his three other friends who have grown to become macho men lived in the city.
66783c88377bdf2f569885f9,4,The story teller had a family farm and the three other friends were always happy to help out in taking looking after the farm.
66783c88377bdf2f569885f9,5,They decided recently to go bear hunting which the story teller was not really interesting in.
66783c88377bdf2f569885f9,6,But he was talked into it and he agreed to go.
66783c88377bdf2f569885f9,7,They flew to some lake in Canada for the bear hunting.
66783c88377bdf2f569885f9,8,"After arrival, they spent about four days playing cards and just having fun."
66783c88377bdf2f569885f9,9,They had told a lot of people that they were going bear hunting and thought it would be embarrassing to return without any bear.
66783c88377bdf2f569885f9,10,So they decided whoever wins the card game goes for the hunt and the rest of the would skin the bear.
66783c88377bdf2f569885f9,11,The story teller won the game and he had to go.
66783c88377bdf2f569885f9,12,"He simply went out, saw a very big bear and tried to shoot, only to realize that his gun was not loaded."
66783c88377bdf2f569885f9,13,"So things took a turn, the story teller ended up being hunted by the huge huge bear."
66783c88377bdf2f569885f9,14,He was running and screaming until he got to the door and started shouting...Open the doorrr.
610b1f14463b800b75ec7b44,1,A group of friends met before 1949 through playing sport
610b1f14463b800b75ec7b44,2,and then went to the same school together as they grew up.
610b1f14463b800b75ec7b44,3,The protagonist of the story was brought up on the farm
610b1f14463b800b75ec7b44,4,"and he never really liked hunting,"
610b1f14463b800b75ec7b44,5,but his group of friends did.
610b1f14463b800b75ec7b44,6,One year his friends decided to go bear hunting in Canada
610b1f14463b800b75ec7b44,7,so they went to a remote cabin.
610b1f14463b800b75ec7b44,8,However when they got there they were all too scared by the woods
610b1f14463b800b75ec7b44,9,and stayed in doors for 4-5 days.
610b1f14463b800b75ec7b44,10,After that time they drew cards to decided who would go bear hunting
610b1f14463b800b75ec7b44,11,because they didnt want to be ridiculed when they got back by everyone who knew they were going bear hunting.
610b1f14463b800b75ec7b44,12,Our protagonist drew the card that meant he had to go bring the bear back
610b1f14463b800b75ec7b44,13,so his friends would skin and gut it.
610b1f14463b800b75ec7b44,14,"The protagonist went into the woods with their gun,"
610b1f14463b800b75ec7b44,15,eventually they came across the biggest bear they had ever seen.
610b1f14463b800b75ec7b44,16,They raised their gun and pulled the trigger
610b1f14463b800b75ec7b44,17,however there was no shot fired because they had forgotten to load the gun.
610b1f14463b800b75ec7b44,18,The protagonist ran as fast as they could back to the cabin
610b1f14463b800b75ec7b44,19,shouting open the door.
610b1f14463b800b75ec7b44,20,When they got inside they said here is your bear now its your turn to skin it.
610b1f14463b800b75ec7b44,21,The friends never asked the protagonist to go hunting ever again.
5c6c08c5d9c1580001ce9aab,1,A group of guys were athletes at different school
5c6c08c5d9c1580001ce9aab,2,"so knew of each other,"
5c6c08c5d9c1580001ce9aab,3,but didn't come friends until further education.
5c6c08c5d9c1580001ce9aab,4,The story-teller was a farmer
5c6c08c5d9c1580001ce9aab,5,"and his 3 city friends would come out to the farm to help him,"
5c6c08c5d9c1580001ce9aab,6,esp hunting (which he didn't like doing).
5c6c08c5d9c1580001ce9aab,7,One year they decided to go to Canada to hunt bears
5c6c08c5d9c1580001ce9aab,8,"(even though the story teller didn't want to, he allowed himself to be persuaded)."
5c6c08c5d9c1580001ce9aab,9,They took a long journey into the wilderness
5c6c08c5d9c1580001ce9aab,10,"and at the cabin decided it was too scary out there to hunt,"
5c6c08c5d9c1580001ce9aab,11,so they chilled for a few days.
5c6c08c5d9c1580001ce9aab,12,They realised they'd be mocked if they didn't bring back a bear
5c6c08c5d9c1580001ce9aab,13,so drew cards for who would hunt alone.
5c6c08c5d9c1580001ce9aab,14,The story-teller got the high card
5c6c08c5d9c1580001ce9aab,15,so had to hunt.
5c6c08c5d9c1580001ce9aab,16,They found a huge bear
5c6c08c5d9c1580001ce9aab,17,"but forgot the bullets,"
5c6c08c5d9c1580001ce9aab,18,so tried to fire then had to run away.
5c6c08c5d9c1580001ce9aab,19,It chased him back to the cabin
5c6c08c5d9c1580001ce9aab,20,"and ended up in the cabin with the friends,"
5c6c08c5d9c1580001ce9aab,21,"so he did keep his side of the deal,"
5c6c08c5d9c1580001ce9aab,22,that he'd catch it and the others had to process it.
5c6c08c5d9c1580001ce9aab,23,They never invited him again
5c6c08c5d9c1580001ce9aab,24,but agreed he'd done his part of the deal.
60618b3bff746e7fbfc84910,1,I built a relationship with three buddies I was acquainted with.
60618b3bff746e7fbfc84910,2,"After graduation, we met again in college."
60618b3bff746e7fbfc84910,3,That is when the friendship started.
60618b3bff746e7fbfc84910,4,This was back in 1949.
60618b3bff746e7fbfc84910,5,One day they suggested that we go hunting.
60618b3bff746e7fbfc84910,6,But I was not keen on taking part in that activity.
60618b3bff746e7fbfc84910,7,"However, I let them talk me into it."
60618b3bff746e7fbfc84910,8,We made sure that we rented out a cabin.
60618b3bff746e7fbfc84910,9,We ensured that we had enough groceries.
60618b3bff746e7fbfc84910,10,The people who suggested that we go hunting chickened out.
60618b3bff746e7fbfc84910,11,That meant we were stuck in the cabin for four days without doing anything.
60618b3bff746e7fbfc84910,12,The idea of going home without a bear or nothing to show that we at least attempted to hunt did not sit well with one of my friends.
60618b3bff746e7fbfc84910,13,So they decided to bet on who would go out to kill the bear.
60618b3bff746e7fbfc84910,14,Can you guess who the bear fell on?
60618b3bff746e7fbfc84910,15,"Me, the person who initially did not want to go hunting."
60618b3bff746e7fbfc84910,16,I then took the gun and went hunting for the bear for hours.
60618b3bff746e7fbfc84910,17,"Suddenly, I heard something behind me."
60618b3bff746e7fbfc84910,18,"When I turned around, I saw a large bear staring at me."
60618b3bff746e7fbfc84910,19,"In as much as I was scared, I thought BINGO!"
60618b3bff746e7fbfc84910,20,Finally a bear I can finally take to my friends.
60618b3bff746e7fbfc84910,21,I then attempted to open fire.
60618b3bff746e7fbfc84910,22,But the gun would not go off.
60618b3bff746e7fbfc84910,23,I then realized that the gun was not loaded.
60618b3bff746e7fbfc84910,24,The only thing I could do is run for my life because bears are terrifying.
60618b3bff746e7fbfc84910,25,Finally saw the cabin we rented.
60618b3bff746e7fbfc84910,26,"I started shouting, ""open the door"" to my friends."
60618b3bff746e7fbfc84910,27,I went into the cabin.
60618b3bff746e7fbfc84910,28,I made sure to shut the cabin door shut!
60618b3bff746e7fbfc84910,29,My friends could not believe it.
60618b3bff746e7fbfc84910,30,They've never suggested that I go hunting with them ever again.
5f7f18137488a50407d729e6,1,I had three friends from school at the same place.
5f7f18137488a50407d729e6,2,"During high school, we were all high school athletes at different schools."
5f7f18137488a50407d729e6,3,We became acquainted.
5f7f18137488a50407d729e6,4,"After graduation, we all enrolled in school."
5f7f18137488a50407d729e6,5,Four of us were attending the same school.
5f7f18137488a50407d729e6,6,We became good friends.
5f7f18137488a50407d729e6,7,I was a child from a farm.
5f7f18137488a50407d729e6,8,The other guys all lived in the city.
5f7f18137488a50407d729e6,9,They used to come to the farm and hunt.
5f7f18137488a50407d729e6,10,They even helped me with house chores.
5f7f18137488a50407d729e6,11,Then we would go for rabbit hunting and squirrel hunting.
5f7f18137488a50407d729e6,12,I didn't like hunting.
5f7f18137488a50407d729e6,13,"But being born in the farm, I was used to the outdoors."
5f7f18137488a50407d729e6,14,"I will go along with the guys, just to be one of the group."
5f7f18137488a50407d729e6,15,We hunted for several years.
5f7f18137488a50407d729e6,16,They always came to me and hunt.
5f7f18137488a50407d729e6,17,"After being together for years, one came with the idea of bear hunting in Canada."
5f7f18137488a50407d729e6,18,I didn't like the idea.
5f7f18137488a50407d729e6,19,But I would always been one of the group.
5f7f18137488a50407d729e6,20,I didn't have a reason to stay behind.
5f7f18137488a50407d729e6,21,We took an airplane and flew to Canada.
5f7f18137488a50407d729e6,22,We landed on the lake and rented canoes.
5f7f18137488a50407d729e6,23,We got groceries.
5f7f18137488a50407d729e6,24,No one was in the mood to go out for hunting.
5f7f18137488a50407d729e6,25,"So we played cards, ate and slept."
5f7f18137488a50407d729e6,26,We sat indoors for three to four days.
5f7f18137488a50407d729e6,27,One day I took the old gun and go out bear hunting.
5a0c4184fe645f0001e9f5dd,1,A story about a man and three friends in 1949.
5a0c4184fe645f0001e9f5dd,2,The man knew the other three men from high school.
5a0c4184fe645f0001e9f5dd,3,They each went to different schools.
5a0c4184fe645f0001e9f5dd,4,Then they went to the same college.
5a0c4184fe645f0001e9f5dd,5,The man lived on a farm.
5a0c4184fe645f0001e9f5dd,6,His 3 friends were from the city.
5a0c4184fe645f0001e9f5dd,7,The friends liked to go hunting.
5a0c4184fe645f0001e9f5dd,8,"Even though he did not like hunting, they persuaded him to go bear hunting."
5a0c4184fe645f0001e9f5dd,9,They arranged to go up to a cabin in the woods.
5a0c4184fe645f0001e9f5dd,10,They planned to hunt for bears.
5a0c4184fe645f0001e9f5dd,11,They got to the cabin.
5a0c4184fe645f0001e9f5dd,12,They found it to be very creepy.
5a0c4184fe645f0001e9f5dd,13,None of the men wanted to go hunting in the end.
5a0c4184fe645f0001e9f5dd,14,They stayed in the cabin for 3 days without leaving.
5a0c4184fe645f0001e9f5dd,15,Then the three friends decided that they must go hunting.
5a0c4184fe645f0001e9f5dd,16,People back home knew they had come to hunt a bear.
5a0c4184fe645f0001e9f5dd,17,So they had to take a bear home.
5a0c4184fe645f0001e9f5dd,18,They decided to draw cards.
5a0c4184fe645f0001e9f5dd,19,The one who got the highest card would go out and kill the bear.
5a0c4184fe645f0001e9f5dd,20,The rest would skin and chop up the bear to take home.
5a0c4184fe645f0001e9f5dd,21,The man drew the highest card.
5a0c4184fe645f0001e9f5dd,22,So he had to take a gun and hunt a bear.
5a0c4184fe645f0001e9f5dd,23,He struggled at first to find any bear.
5a0c4184fe645f0001e9f5dd,24,But after several hours he spotted a bear.
5a0c4184fe645f0001e9f5dd,25,"When he went to fire the gun, there were no bullets in it."
5a0c4184fe645f0001e9f5dd,26,The bear chased him back to the cabin.
5a0c4184fe645f0001e9f5dd,27,And the friends never asked him to go hunting again.
6676d189dcbd4eca274768b2,1,Me and my friends met at school in 1949.
6676d189dcbd4eca274768b2,2,My friends were athletes and liked to hunt for squirrels and rabbits.
6676d189dcbd4eca274768b2,3,"My friends suggested that we go out to Canada to go bear hunting,"
6676d189dcbd4eca274768b2,4,but I wasn’t so sure.
6676d189dcbd4eca274768b2,5,"When we got there, nobody wanted to go"
6676d189dcbd4eca274768b2,6,and we stayed in the cabin for three of four days.
6676d189dcbd4eca274768b2,7,We wanted to bring something back though
6676d189dcbd4eca274768b2,8,so it didn’t look like we skunked out.
6676d189dcbd4eca274768b2,9,"Guess who it was that ended up going hunting,"
6676d189dcbd4eca274768b2,10,it was me.
6676d189dcbd4eca274768b2,11,My friends said that they would skin tans pack the bear when I brought it back.
6676d189dcbd4eca274768b2,12,I went out to find one
6676d189dcbd4eca274768b2,13,and saw it.
6676d189dcbd4eca274768b2,14,"It was THE BIGGEST bear I had ever seen,"
6676d189dcbd4eca274768b2,15,even bigger than ones I had seen in photos.
6676d189dcbd4eca274768b2,16,I took a shot with my gun
6676d189dcbd4eca274768b2,17,but the gun was not loaded.
6676d189dcbd4eca274768b2,18,I ran towards the cabin
6676d189dcbd4eca274768b2,19,but the bear did not want me in his territory.
6676d189dcbd4eca274768b2,20,He ran also.
6676d189dcbd4eca274768b2,21,"When I got back, I slammed the door"
6676d189dcbd4eca274768b2,22,and told my friends that the bear is ‘RIGHT OUTSIDE’.
6676d189dcbd4eca274768b2,23,I told them that ‘THEY CAN SKIN IT AND PACK IT’.
6676d189dcbd4eca274768b2,24,"Despite what happened, my friends thought I did a pretty good job at my task."
6676d189dcbd4eca274768b2,25,That was thirty years ago
6676d189dcbd4eca274768b2,26,and I haven’t been asked to go bear hunting again since.
5e15d85bd62abeba42692ed3,1,The story was about a person and his three friends.
5e15d85bd62abeba42692ed3,2,They had gone to school in the same place.
5e15d85bd62abeba42692ed3,3,Then they met at college in 1949.
5e15d85bd62abeba42692ed3,4,Their paths had crossed in the past.
5e15d85bd62abeba42692ed3,5,"Despite attending different schools, they had all been athletic."
5e15d85bd62abeba42692ed3,6,So they had become acquainted.
5e15d85bd62abeba42692ed3,7,They became good friends after graduation.
5e15d85bd62abeba42692ed3,8,When they then attended the same school.
5e15d85bd62abeba42692ed3,9,The author had lived on a farm.
5e15d85bd62abeba42692ed3,10,But the other three were from the city.
5e15d85bd62abeba42692ed3,11,The friends used to meet up on the farm to hunt for rabbits and squirrels.
5e15d85bd62abeba42692ed3,12,The city boys used to enjoy it more than the author.
5e15d85bd62abeba42692ed3,13,He'd been brought up on the farm.
5e15d85bd62abeba42692ed3,14,So it was the norm for him.
5e15d85bd62abeba42692ed3,15,And he didn't get excited by it.
5e15d85bd62abeba42692ed3,16,This went on for quite a few years.
5e15d85bd62abeba42692ed3,17,Until one day the young men decided that they would like to go bear hunting in Canada.
5e15d85bd62abeba42692ed3,18,Whilst the idea didn't really appeal to the author.
5e15d85bd62abeba42692ed3,19,He was part of the group.
5e15d85bd62abeba42692ed3,20,And got talked into going along with them.
5e15d85bd62abeba42692ed3,21,He was concerned that he may be hunted by the bear rather than the other way round.
5e15d85bd62abeba42692ed3,22,They took an aeroplane.
5e15d85bd62abeba42692ed3,23,And landed on a lake.
5e15d85bd62abeba42692ed3,24,It was still a long way to their destination.
5e15d85bd62abeba42692ed3,25,And they had to hike and use canoes to get there.
5e15d85bd62abeba42692ed3,26,They reached their cabin.
5e15d85bd62abeba42692ed3,27,But the author was still apprehensive about the expedition.
5e15d85bd62abeba42692ed3,28,And described it as spooky.
5e15d85bd62abeba42692ed3,29,"In fact, none of the men wanted to go out into the woods."
5e15d85bd62abeba42692ed3,30,So they stayed in the cabin for several days.
5e15d85bd62abeba42692ed3,31,They had taken groceries with them.
5e15d85bd62abeba42692ed3,32,And played cards.
5e15d85bd62abeba42692ed3,33,They then discussed the shame of returning home having not hunted a bear.
5e15d85bd62abeba42692ed3,34,As they had told too many people about it.
5e15d85bd62abeba42692ed3,35,And knew that there was an expectation.
5e15d85bd62abeba42692ed3,36,They used the cards to determine who was going to go out to hunt the bear.
5e15d85bd62abeba42692ed3,37,The person who drew the high card would be the one to go.
5e15d85bd62abeba42692ed3,38,"Unfortunately for the author, it was him."
5e15d85bd62abeba42692ed3,39,Typical as he was the one that didn't want to be there in the first place.
5e15d85bd62abeba42692ed3,40,He grabbed his and went into the woods.
5e15d85bd62abeba42692ed3,41,There was a noise.
5e15d85bd62abeba42692ed3,42,And he turned around to face the biggest bear ever.
5e15d85bd62abeba42692ed3,43,He aimed at it with his gun.
5e15d85bd62abeba42692ed3,44,Then realised he had forgotten to load it.
5e15d85bd62abeba42692ed3,45,The bear was angry.
5e15d85bd62abeba42692ed3,46,And started to chase him.
5e15d85bd62abeba42692ed3,47,"Luckily, despite the bear being on his heels, he reached the cabin."
5e15d85bd62abeba42692ed3,48,And shouted for the others to open the door.
5e15d85bd62abeba42692ed3,49,He then made a quick left turn.
5e15d85bd62abeba42692ed3,50,But the bear turned right.
5e15d85bd62abeba42692ed3,51,"Once safely inside the cabin, the author then said to his friends ""There he is."
5e15d85bd62abeba42692ed3,52,"You skin him and I'll go and get another one!"""
5e15d85bd62abeba42692ed3,53,Thirty years had elapsed.
5e15d85bd62abeba42692ed3,54,And the friends had had not desire to go hunting ever again.
5c93b062c9d93b0015fcbc02,1,A guy made 3 friends during high school
5c93b062c9d93b0015fcbc02,2,"and they all decided to go hunting bear one day,"
5c93b062c9d93b0015fcbc02,3,as they were avid hunters at his farm for several years.
5c93b062c9d93b0015fcbc02,4,He didnt really want to go
5c93b062c9d93b0015fcbc02,5,but felt that he had to.
5c93b062c9d93b0015fcbc02,6,When they got there nobody wanted to hunt
5c93b062c9d93b0015fcbc02,7,but decided they must to bring back for show.
5c93b062c9d93b0015fcbc02,8,They drew stakes
5c93b062c9d93b0015fcbc02,9,and he got the high card
5c93b062c9d93b0015fcbc02,10,and ended up hunting bear alone.
5c93b062c9d93b0015fcbc02,11,He came across one
5c93b062c9d93b0015fcbc02,12,that chased him back to the cabin
5c93b062c9d93b0015fcbc02,13,and he tricked them into letting it in the cabin to deal with.
5c93b062c9d93b0015fcbc02,14,He wasnt invited hunting again.
655621646782dec335983823,1,"4 guys went to the same high school together,"
655621646782dec335983823,2,but didn't become close friends until they all went to another school together.
655621646782dec335983823,3,The main one lived on a farm
655621646782dec335983823,4,and the other 3 lived in the city.
655621646782dec335983823,5,"They all used to go hunting on his farm together,"
655621646782dec335983823,6,but he didn't really care for hunting.
655621646782dec335983823,7,They all decided to go on a bear hunting trip.
655621646782dec335983823,8,They travelled for a long time
655621646782dec335983823,9,until they got to a cabin they had rented.
655621646782dec335983823,10,They stayed there for 3 or 4 days
655621646782dec335983823,11,before realising none of them wanted to go hunting.
655621646782dec335983823,12,They needed to take a bear home
655621646782dec335983823,13,otherwise the other people would give them a bad time.
655621646782dec335983823,14,"They played a card game to decide who would go and get a bear,"
655621646782dec335983823,15,and the other 3 would skin the bear and pack it.
655621646782dec335983823,16,The main man got the highest card
655621646782dec335983823,17,so went to get a bear.
655621646782dec335983823,18,He found one
655621646782dec335983823,19,and went to shoot
655621646782dec335983823,20,but realised he hadn't loaded the gun.
655621646782dec335983823,21,He ran whilst the bear chased him back to the cabin.
655621646782dec335983823,22,He shouted to be let into the cabin
655621646782dec335983823,23,"and turned left once he got in,"
655621646782dec335983823,24,then the bear came in.
655621646782dec335983823,25,The rest of the men agreed that he had gotten a bear.
655621646782dec335983823,26,This story took place 30 years ago
655621646782dec335983823,27,and he hasn't been asked to go hunting since.
5c3130a10091e40001cc1794,1,Three friends met at school
5c3130a10091e40001cc1794,2,and then ended up going to the same college in 1949.
5c3130a10091e40001cc1794,3,The narrator of the story grew up on a farm
5c3130a10091e40001cc1794,4,and was used to the outdoor life.
5c3130a10091e40001cc1794,5,His friends did not so enjoyed staying with him
5c3130a10091e40001cc1794,6,"and as they were pretty macho, they enjoyed going out hunting."
5c3130a10091e40001cc1794,7,The narrator didn't like hunting
5c3130a10091e40001cc1794,8,but just went along with it.
5c3130a10091e40001cc1794,9,They hunted rabbits and squirrels.
5c3130a10091e40001cc1794,10,One of them came up with the idea to go and hunt a bear.
5c3130a10091e40001cc1794,11,The narrator really didn't want to go and hunt a bear
5c3130a10091e40001cc1794,12,but just went along with it.
5c3130a10091e40001cc1794,13,They took an airplane from Fort Wayne to some place in Canada.
5c3130a10091e40001cc1794,14,They had to canoe a distance using paddles
5c3130a10091e40001cc1794,15,and then had to backpack on foot to get to a remote cabin in the woods they had rented.
5c3130a10091e40001cc1794,16,The location was quite spooky and remote
5c3130a10091e40001cc1794,17,"and when they were there none of them fancied actually going outside and hunting,"
5c3130a10091e40001cc1794,18,the narrator was very apprehensive!
5c3130a10091e40001cc1794,19,They stayed for 3 or 4 days playing cards and chatting
5c3130a10091e40001cc1794,20,but then one of them said we do actually need to go and hunt a bear as everyone knows that's why we have come
5c3130a10091e40001cc1794,21,so we either need to hunt one or find a bear to take back with us.
5c3130a10091e40001cc1794,22,They drew cards
5c3130a10091e40001cc1794,23,and the narrator got the short straw and was the one who had to go out.
5c3130a10091e40001cc1794,24,He took his gun and walked around for a few hours.
5c3130a10091e40001cc1794,25,Eventually he heard a noise
5c3130a10091e40001cc1794,26,"and saw the biggest bear he had ever seen,"
5c3130a10091e40001cc1794,27,he had never seen a picture of a bear so big.
5c3130a10091e40001cc1794,28,He took a shot
5c3130a10091e40001cc1794,29,"and nothing happened,"
5c3130a10091e40001cc1794,30,he realised he had forgotten to load it.
5c3130a10091e40001cc1794,31,So he ran and ran as fast as he could
5c3130a10091e40001cc1794,32,"and the bear followed,"
5c3130a10091e40001cc1794,33,"he got to the cabin and yelled to open the door,"
5c3130a10091e40001cc1794,34,"and he got right up to the cabin door,"
5c3130a10091e40001cc1794,35,the door opened
5c3130a10091e40001cc1794,36,and the bear ran straight in
5c3130a10091e40001cc1794,37,"and he said there you go a bear to skin, I'll go find another."
5c3130a10091e40001cc1794,38,His friends agreed he had lived up to his part of the task
5c3130a10091e40001cc1794,39,and they never asked him to go hunting again.
66921dd9f8e4de298758c407,1,god
66921dd9f8e4de298758c407,2,that was really hard
66921dd9f8e4de298758c407,3,It started to make me dizzy
66921dd9f8e4de298758c407,4,haha
66921dd9f8e4de298758c407,5,the story is about 4 friends
66921dd9f8e4de298758c407,6,that meet in high school
66921dd9f8e4de298758c407,7,and they like to hunt
66921dd9f8e4de298758c407,8,"Sorry,"
66921dd9f8e4de298758c407,9,that's all iv got
60abcd6f3e5efd9fca235828,1,I started college with my three friends in 1949.
60abcd6f3e5efd9fca235828,2,We were buddies from when I was little.
60abcd6f3e5efd9fca235828,3,I lived on a farm and they used to come and stay the holiday with me.
60abcd6f3e5efd9fca235828,4,They loved hunting but I did not.
60abcd6f3e5efd9fca235828,5,It was not my thing.
60abcd6f3e5efd9fca235828,6,They used to hunt squirrels and racoons.
60abcd6f3e5efd9fca235828,7,When we were in college they suggested that we go bear hunting.
60abcd6f3e5efd9fca235828,8,I was not keen at all to go but I did.
60abcd6f3e5efd9fca235828,9,We packed up our stuff and took a plane to Canada up north and landed on a lake.
60abcd6f3e5efd9fca235828,10,When we got to our cabin we did not want to leave and go outside because this place was very spooky.
60abcd6f3e5efd9fca235828,11,We never left the cabin until one of them said that one of us has to go out and shoot a bear because lots of people know that we went bear hunting and it would be embarrassing to go back without a bear.
60abcd6f3e5efd9fca235828,12,So we had to draw straws and guess who got the short straw? me.
60abcd6f3e5efd9fca235828,13,The person who does not like to hunt and did not want even come on this trip.
60abcd6f3e5efd9fca235828,14,So off I went into the forest and came across the biggest bear that I have ever seen.
60abcd6f3e5efd9fca235828,15,This bear was so big that I have not even seen pictures of a bear so big.
60abcd6f3e5efd9fca235828,16,I pointed my gun and fired but nothing happened because I forgot to load my gun.
60abcd6f3e5efd9fca235828,17,The bear heard me and I started to run.
60abcd6f3e5efd9fca235828,18,I ran to the cabin and the bear gave chase.
60abcd6f3e5efd9fca235828,19,I got to the cabin and banged on the door.
60abcd6f3e5efd9fca235828,20,The door opened and the bear came sliding in to the cabin.
60abcd6f3e5efd9fca235828,21,"I told my friends you wanted a bear, well there it is, you can skin it and bag it."
60abcd6f3e5efd9fca235828,22,My friends never asked me to come hunting with them again.
665adfe2f8a77b62563b293e,1,Three friends then another person met at school
665adfe2f8a77b62563b293e,2,they became friend
665adfe2f8a77b62563b293e,3,which they used to come his farm for hunting squirrel
665adfe2f8a77b62563b293e,4,and three of them live in well place as town
665adfe2f8a77b62563b293e,5,and he used to live village area
665adfe2f8a77b62563b293e,6,by good bonding they decided to hunting bear in Canada
665adfe2f8a77b62563b293e,7,he cant say no to them
665adfe2f8a77b62563b293e,8,because he dont have good knowledge about that
665adfe2f8a77b62563b293e,9,and so on they gone
665adfe2f8a77b62563b293e,10,and landed in a courtage
665adfe2f8a77b62563b293e,11,and they gave up for the hunting bear of fear
665adfe2f8a77b62563b293e,12,and they used to enjoy a lot their playing cards
665adfe2f8a77b62563b293e,13,and they deceived to cut the bear by buying it
665adfe2f8a77b62563b293e,14,continuing the scenario they gave up.
665adfe2f8a77b62563b293e,15,happily living there.
66a3b02a9431f9e9149cca2a,1,A man had met his three friends due to their athletic experiences in high school.
66a3b02a9431f9e9149cca2a,2,"However, they only started being friends after they all found out they were going to the same post-secondary school."
66a3b02a9431f9e9149cca2a,3,"The man was a rural boy while his 3 friends were city boys,"
66a3b02a9431f9e9149cca2a,4,and because of this the 3 all had a knack for hunting.
66a3b02a9431f9e9149cca2a,5,"In 1949, the group decided to go bear hunting,"
66a3b02a9431f9e9149cca2a,6,despite the man not really wanting to.
66a3b02a9431f9e9149cca2a,7,They then travelled to Canada via plane
66a3b02a9431f9e9149cca2a,8,"and trekked through the woods to get to a cabin,"
66a3b02a9431f9e9149cca2a,9,but the eerie atmosphere caused none of them to actually want to go hunting.
66a3b02a9431f9e9149cca2a,10,"They thought of the consequences of coming back with no bear,"
66a3b02a9431f9e9149cca2a,11,"which caused them to decide to send one person out there to hunt,"
66a3b02a9431f9e9149cca2a,12,which happened to be the man.
66a3b02a9431f9e9149cca2a,13,"He ended up finding a giant old bear,"
66a3b02a9431f9e9149cca2a,14,"but forgot to load the gun,"
66a3b02a9431f9e9149cca2a,15,"so he had to run back to the cabin with the bear on his tail,"
66a3b02a9431f9e9149cca2a,16,thankfully being safe.
66a3b02a9431f9e9149cca2a,17,30 years later and his 3 friends haven't asked him to go hunting since.
5e3e964a5ed1320e1757da5a,1,A group of 3 male friends in 1946 who used to go hunting together
5e3e964a5ed1320e1757da5a,2,The main protagonist wasn't really into it all
5e3e964a5ed1320e1757da5a,3,He just went hunting with them to fit in
5e3e964a5ed1320e1757da5a,4,One day they travel to Canada on a flight
5e3e964a5ed1320e1757da5a,5,They canoe and backpack to go hunt a bear
5e3e964a5ed1320e1757da5a,6,They started slacking off
5e3e964a5ed1320e1757da5a,7,They then decided they needed to bring a bear back with them or be made fun of
5e3e964a5ed1320e1757da5a,8,They decided who went to get the bear with a card game of who got the highest card
5e3e964a5ed1320e1757da5a,9,The main protagonist did
5e3e964a5ed1320e1757da5a,10,So he went outside to go hunt a bear
5e3e964a5ed1320e1757da5a,11,He encountered the biggest old bear ever
5e3e964a5ed1320e1757da5a,12,He forgot to load his gun
5e3e964a5ed1320e1757da5a,13,So he ran back to the cabin

5e3e964a5ed1320e1757da5a,16,They haven't gone hunting since.
60eda0b5e8f579f6a73d0f6b,1,"In 1949, three friends who went to school together and college together, were acquainted through this."
60eda0b5e8f579f6a73d0f6b,2,One of them lived on a farm whilst the other two were city boys.

60eda0b5e8f579f6a73d0f6b,4,They did this for several years and were all quite macho men.
60eda0b5e8f579f6a73d0f6b,5,One day the 2 city friends decided to go hunting for some bears.
60eda0b5e8f579f6a73d0f6b,6,They convinced the main character to go as he had no other reason not to despite the fact he didn't like hunting.
60eda0b5e8f579f6a73d0f6b,7,But he got convinced and they left for Canada.
60eda0b5e8f579f6a73d0f6b,8,They took a flight out from from Fort Wayne and landed near a lake in Canada.
60eda0b5e8f579f6a73d0f6b,9,They rented Canoes to cross the river and get to their destination.
60eda0b5e8f579f6a73d0f6b,10,In total it took 500 miles to get to their location.
60eda0b5e8f579f6a73d0f6b,11,They got to the cabin where they stayed for 3 or 4 days and didn't hunt due to the creepy nature of their surroundings.
60eda0b5e8f579f6a73d0f6b,12,"They played cards, ate food and slept in this cabin for these days."
60eda0b5e8f579f6a73d0f6b,13,Eventually one of the friends said they need to hunt a bear because they would be given a hard time if they came back empty handed to their folks.
60eda0b5e8f579f6a73d0f6b,14,They used a highest card goes to hunt to decide who will go hunting.
60eda0b5e8f579f6a73d0f6b,15,The man who didn't even want to come had the highest card and was sent to hunt.
60eda0b5e8f579f6a73d0f6b,16,He found the bear and was bigger than anything he had ever seen.
60eda0b5e8f579f6a73d0f6b,17,When he went for the shot his gun was not loaded and he had to run whilst the bear started chasing him down.
60eda0b5e8f579f6a73d0f6b,18,He ran back down to the cabin screaming for the door to be open as the bear was on his heels.
60eda0b5e8f579f6a73d0f6b,19,He ran in and avoided the bear and the bear got put down.
60eda0b5e8f579f6a73d0f6b,20,After this they never went hunting again and this was a story recalled from 30 years ago.
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,1,"I know a story from 1949,"
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,2,"when I had three friends in college,"
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,3,"who I had been in the same class as in highschool,"
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,4,but grew close too in college when we realised we came from the same school.
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,5,"They were 3 macho men,"
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,6,and we all had been athletes.
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,7,"After a few years,"
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,8,one of them suggested that we go up to Canada to go squirrel and rabbit hunting.
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,9,"I didn't really like hunting,"
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,10,"but I had done everything with that group,"
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,11,so I left them talk me into it.
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,12,"One of them eventually suggested we go bear hunting instead,"
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,13,"so we took a plane up to Fort Wayne,"
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,14,and hiked for a day and a half up to a cabin.
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,15,"The woods were really spooky,"
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,16,"and all the others suddenly didn't feel like going bear hunting either, like me."
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,17,"So for a few days we waited in the cabin,"
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,18,"eating, sleeping, playing cards,"
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,19,"until one of us realised that too many people knew we had gone back bear hunting,"
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,20,so we needed to head back with a bear.
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,21,"They decided, and I agreed, that they would cut cards to decide which one of us would go out,"
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,22,"get a bear,"
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,23,and bring it back for the rest to skin and pack so we can take it home.
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,24,"And WHO WOULD HAVE GUESSED,"
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,25,but it was the guy who didn't even want to go hunting in the first place.
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,26,But I had agreed to this process.
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,27,"So I took our shotgun,"
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,28,"went out and walked for hours but didn't find anything,"
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,29,"when suddenly I heard a noise,"
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,30,and turned to see the biggest old bear I have ever seen.
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,31,"I aimed my gun and shot it at it,"
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,32,but then realised I had forgotten to load it!
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,33,"But the bear didn't like having me in its territory,"
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,34,so it came after me.
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,35,I turned and ran.
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,36,"I thought I was pretty fast,"
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,37,but the old bear was gaining on me.
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,38,"I ran as fast as I could back to the cabin,"
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,39,"yelling ""OPEN THE DOOR, OPEN THE DOOR""."
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,40,"They opened the door to the cabin,"
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,41,"and at the last moment I turned left,"
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,42,"the bear turned right into the cabin,"
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,43,and I turned and shut the door.
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,44,"I yelled ""OK I FOUND A BEAR NOW YOU GUYS SKIN AND PACK IT, I WILL GO FIND ANOTHER ONE""."
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,45,"The others couldn't deny that I had done what I had been told to do,"
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,46,but they haven't invited me out hunting since...
640f2f12026d7482857fe195,1,Man was talking about his friendship with three buddies he made in 1949.
640f2f12026d7482857fe195,2,They were acquaintances previous to that
640f2f12026d7482857fe195,3,having been sports men in each of their respective schools.
640f2f12026d7482857fe195,4,He was raised on a farm
640f2f12026d7482857fe195,5,whereas his buddies were raised in the city.
640f2f12026d7482857fe195,6,They used to hunt rabbits and squirrels on his farm
640f2f12026d7482857fe195,7,and decided to go bear hunting in a creepy secluded place in northern Canada.
640f2f12026d7482857fe195,8,He had to get the bear
640f2f12026d7482857fe195,9,and they had to skin it
640f2f12026d7482857fe195,10,and pack it as a trophy.
604b2da4f24a3d7a227553a0,1,I had some friends from college in 1949.
604b2da4f24a3d7a227553a0,2,We became acquainted through sport.
604b2da4f24a3d7a227553a0,3,We went to different schools but through sport became friends.
604b2da4f24a3d7a227553a0,4,"When we finished school, we somehow applied to the same college and became reacquainted."
604b2da4f24a3d7a227553a0,5,The other three boys were from the city while I was a farm boy.
604b2da4f24a3d7a227553a0,6,"Even though I didn't like hunting, we used to go hunting together, hunting animals like squirrels."
604b2da4f24a3d7a227553a0,7,"One time, the boys decided to go hunt a bear in Canada."
604b2da4f24a3d7a227553a0,8,I didn't like the idea but had to go along because my friends wanted to go hunting.
604b2da4f24a3d7a227553a0,9,We left Fort Wayne and went further north into the northern forests of Canada.
604b2da4f24a3d7a227553a0,10,We reached a lake and took canoes out until we couldn't go further.
604b2da4f24a3d7a227553a0,11,We then hiked for 500 miles until we reached our cabin.
604b2da4f24a3d7a227553a0,12,"We didn't want to hunt a bear, so we stayed in the cabin for four or five days, playing cards."
604b2da4f24a3d7a227553a0,13,"After four or five days, one of the boys said we need to hunt a bear or the people we told back home would laugh at us."
604b2da4f24a3d7a227553a0,14,So we decided whoever pulled the highest card would have to hunt the bear.
604b2da4f24a3d7a227553a0,15,Guess who got picked?
604b2da4f24a3d7a227553a0,16,"The guy who didn't even want to go hunting, me!"
604b2da4f24a3d7a227553a0,17,I walked for bit until I found a huge bear.
604b2da4f24a3d7a227553a0,18,I didn't even see one so big in pictures.
604b2da4f24a3d7a227553a0,19,I took the shot and missed.
604b2da4f24a3d7a227553a0,20,The bear chased me and I ran as fast as I could.
604b2da4f24a3d7a227553a0,21,"When I was close to the cabin, I shouted, ""OPEN THE DOOR! OPEN THE DOOR!"" and quickly turned sharply left."
604b2da4f24a3d7a227553a0,22,"The bear ran straight through the door into the cabin, and I said, ""There, I brought you a bear."""
604b2da4f24a3d7a227553a0,23,It's no wonder the guys don't take me hunting since this event.
604b2da4f24a3d7a227553a0,24,This happened 30 years ago.
5d8154a847a45600189e8f35,1,This person talked about their group of friends
5d8154a847a45600189e8f35,2,that they met in 1949
5d8154a847a45600189e8f35,3,or possibly before that.
5d8154a847a45600189e8f35,4,They went to high school together
5d8154a847a45600189e8f35,5,and college.
5d8154a847a45600189e8f35,6,The other 3 were city boys
5d8154a847a45600189e8f35,7,but the narrator was grew up on a farm.
5d8154a847a45600189e8f35,8,"So the city boys would go to the farm to hunt,"
5d8154a847a45600189e8f35,9,"especially rabbits, etc."
5d8154a847a45600189e8f35,10,After some time the friends suggested going bear hunting in Canada.
5d8154a847a45600189e8f35,11,"Despite the narrator being reluctant,"
5d8154a847a45600189e8f35,12,they still went along with it.
5d8154a847a45600189e8f35,13,The place they ended up going to was so spooky
5d8154a847a45600189e8f35,14,that they decided to stay in the cabin
5d8154a847a45600189e8f35,15,and not to go looking for a bear.
5d8154a847a45600189e8f35,16,They played cards
5d8154a847a45600189e8f35,17,and passed the time.
5d8154a847a45600189e8f35,18,After a a few days they decided to find a bear
5d8154a847a45600189e8f35,19,so they wouldn't lose face when they returned.
5d8154a847a45600189e8f35,20,They decided to draw straws
5d8154a847a45600189e8f35,21,and the narrator was picked to find a bear
5d8154a847a45600189e8f35,22,but the friends would need to skin the bear.
5d8154a847a45600189e8f35,23,The narrator went out and found a bear
5d8154a847a45600189e8f35,24,but had forgotten to load the gun
5d8154a847a45600189e8f35,25,so didn't shoot the bear
5d8154a847a45600189e8f35,26,but was chased by the bear all the way back to cabin.
5d8154a847a45600189e8f35,27,"So, despite not killing the bear"
5d8154a847a45600189e8f35,28,the narrator fulfilled their promise of 'getting a bear'.
5d8154a847a45600189e8f35,29,"Since that time,"
5d8154a847a45600189e8f35,30,the narrator hasn't been asked to go hunting ever again!
5deba29b787ce529a9725c54,1,The narrator of the story tells how he knew 3 good friends whom met years before going to college.
5deba29b787ce529a9725c54,2,They became close buddies at College.
5deba29b787ce529a9725c54,3,The main character lived on a farm and the other 3 were city boys.
5deba29b787ce529a9725c54,4,The city boys liked to spend time on the farm and enjoyed helping with chores and particularly hunting.
5deba29b787ce529a9725c54,5,The main character did not enjoy hunting at all.
5deba29b787ce529a9725c54,6,"However later on his 3 friends wanted to go and hunt Bears, so they took off to Canada with the idea to catch and kill a bear and take home."
5deba29b787ce529a9725c54,7,When they arrived in Canada their lodgings were deep in the woods which they found quite scary.
5deba29b787ce529a9725c54,8,None of the men wanted to go out at all and stayed inside for days.
5deba29b787ce529a9725c54,9,Then they decided that they could not go home without taking a bear to show people the results of the Bear hunt and they decided to draw cards as to which one of them would go out and hunt the Bear.
5deba29b787ce529a9725c54,10,"The main character happened to draw the highest card even thought this was his worst case scenario, he did go out and eventually found a bear."
5deba29b787ce529a9725c54,11,"He became so frightened he could not kill it, instead he turned and ran back to the cabin."
5deba29b787ce529a9725c54,12,"As he got close he shouted to his friends to open the door, the Bear was right on his heels."
5deba29b787ce529a9725c54,13,"They opened the door he ran in and turned to the left, with the Bear following him into the cabin."
5deba29b787ce529a9725c54,14,'There' he said to his friends I did what you asked me!
656a013de5b47a977ee5c6a0,1,A man made friends at university with three other men.
656a013de5b47a977ee5c6a0,2,"They had all previously known each other at school, through high-school athletics."
656a013de5b47a977ee5c6a0,3,The man grew up on a farm.
656a013de5b47a977ee5c6a0,4,"The other three, who were city boys, visited him on the farm."
656a013de5b47a977ee5c6a0,5,They went shooting rabbits and squirrels.
656a013de5b47a977ee5c6a0,6,The man wasn't that keen on hunting.
656a013de5b47a977ee5c6a0,7,It was part of rural life.
656a013de5b47a977ee5c6a0,8,His three friends loved it.
656a013de5b47a977ee5c6a0,9,"After graduating university, and several years friendship, the group came up with a plan to go bear hunting."
656a013de5b47a977ee5c6a0,10,The man really wasn't keen on this.
656a013de5b47a977ee5c6a0,11,He was talked into it.
656a013de5b47a977ee5c6a0,12,"The four of them went to Canada, to the North Woods to hunt their bear."
656a013de5b47a977ee5c6a0,13,The trip was long.
656a013de5b47a977ee5c6a0,14,It required a five hundred mile hike to get to the cabin they had booked.
656a013de5b47a977ee5c6a0,15,"Once there they spent the first three days not hunting bears, but instead hanging out, playing cards and so on."
656a013de5b47a977ee5c6a0,16,"On the penultimate night, they decided that they would look very silly if they returned with no bear."
656a013de5b47a977ee5c6a0,17,So they decided that one of them would go out the next day to hunt a bear.
656a013de5b47a977ee5c6a0,18,"Then the other three would skin the bear and prepare it to take home, down south."
656a013de5b47a977ee5c6a0,19,"The protagonist drew the short straw, and was the hunter."
656a013de5b47a977ee5c6a0,20,The next day the man went out and walked for a very long time looking for a bear to no avail.
656a013de5b47a977ee5c6a0,21,"Eventually, he saw an enormous bear."
656a013de5b47a977ee5c6a0,22,He drew his gun.
656a013de5b47a977ee5c6a0,23,But then realized that he hadn't loaded it.
656a013de5b47a977ee5c6a0,24,So he couldn't shoot it.
656a013de5b47a977ee5c6a0,25,The bear was not happy so started to chase him.
656a013de5b47a977ee5c6a0,26,"The man ran, as fast as he could, back to the cabin, with the bear in hot pursuit."
656a013de5b47a977ee5c6a0,27,As he approached the cabin he shouted for his friends to open the door.
656a013de5b47a977ee5c6a0,28,"As he was nearly at the cabin, the man feigned left."
656a013de5b47a977ee5c6a0,29,The bear ran straight into the cabin.
656a013de5b47a977ee5c6a0,30,The man closed the door after him.
656a013de5b47a977ee5c6a0,31,The man is still friendly with the other three.
656a013de5b47a977ee5c6a0,32,But they have never since invited him to go hunting with them.
66a6a5ef86f60251fc4534ad,1,"The story was about three friends he met in 1949 when he started college,"
66a6a5ef86f60251fc4534ad,2,but he met them before that.
66a6a5ef86f60251fc4534ad,3,They had all been high school athletes at different schools.
66a6a5ef86f60251fc4534ad,4,After graduation they all enrolled in school at the same school.
66a6a5ef86f60251fc4534ad,5,Where they became good friends.
66a6a5ef86f60251fc4534ad,6,He lived on a farm and the others all lived in the city.
66a6a5ef86f60251fc4534ad,7,They were all big men who would come to the farm and hunt.
66a6a5ef86f60251fc4534ad,8,They would hunt for rabbits and squirrels.
66a6a5ef86f60251fc4534ad,9,They did this for several years.
66a6a5ef86f60251fc4534ad,10,One of them now wanted to go to Canada to hunt bears.
66a6a5ef86f60251fc4534ad,11,They took a plane out of Fort Wayne and landed in Canada and went straight to a lake and rented canoes.
66a6a5ef86f60251fc4534ad,12,They went way up north in the woods.
66a6a5ef86f60251fc4534ad,13,Them backpacked the rest of the way.
66a6a5ef86f60251fc4534ad,14,They got set up in a cabin.
66a6a5ef86f60251fc4534ad,15,They sat around for three or four days and played cards.
66a6a5ef86f60251fc4534ad,16,They never ventured outside at night.
66a6a5ef86f60251fc4534ad,17,They played a game where the high card would go out into the woods.
66a6a5ef86f60251fc4534ad,18,And he got the high card and took the gun to go bear hunting.
66a6a5ef86f60251fc4534ad,19,He then found a big old bear and he tried to shoot it but nothing happened.
66a6a5ef86f60251fc4534ad,20,He missed and ran away from the old bear.
66a6a5ef86f60251fc4534ad,21,He was shouting open the door to the cabin.
66a6a5ef86f60251fc4534ad,22,This all happened 30 years ago and they have not asked him to go hunting again.
66a64703e3e5dc31b47f050c,1,"A man met his 3 friends in 1949,"
66a64703e3e5dc31b47f050c,2,actually they knew of each other before that due to sports
66a64703e3e5dc31b47f050c,3,but they started college together in 1949.
66a64703e3e5dc31b47f050c,4,"He was from a farming background,"
66a64703e3e5dc31b47f050c,5,the other 3 were city boys.
66a64703e3e5dc31b47f050c,6,All 4 of them used to go back to his farm for breaks.
66a64703e3e5dc31b47f050c,7,"They loved hunting,"
66a64703e3e5dc31b47f050c,8,he didn't.
66a64703e3e5dc31b47f050c,9,"They decided to go to hunt a bear in Canada,"
66a64703e3e5dc31b47f050c,10,the man really didn't want to go
66a64703e3e5dc31b47f050c,11,"but he had always been part of the group,"
66a64703e3e5dc31b47f050c,12,so he went.
66a64703e3e5dc31b47f050c,13,"It took them a long time to get there,"
66a64703e3e5dc31b47f050c,14,the man felt like he trekked 500 miles.
66a64703e3e5dc31b47f050c,15,"When they arrived at the cabin,"
66a64703e3e5dc31b47f050c,16,it was very scary
66a64703e3e5dc31b47f050c,17,and none of them wanted to leave.
66a64703e3e5dc31b47f050c,18,None of them left at night
66a64703e3e5dc31b47f050c,19,and none of them wanted to hunt a bear.
66a64703e3e5dc31b47f050c,20,One of them said 'we must hunt a bear and take one back as people know we are coming out here'.
66a64703e3e5dc31b47f050c,21,"So they decided to split cards,"
66a64703e3e5dc31b47f050c,22,whoever got the highest card had to go out and hunt the bear.
66a64703e3e5dc31b47f050c,23,The man who didn't want to go got the highest card
66a64703e3e5dc31b47f050c,24,so out he went.
66a64703e3e5dc31b47f050c,25,He eventually found a bear
66a64703e3e5dc31b47f050c,26,and shot at it
66a64703e3e5dc31b47f050c,27,but nothing happened...
66a64703e3e5dc31b47f050c,28,he hadn't loaded the gun.
66a64703e3e5dc31b47f050c,29,"The bear started running at him,"
66a64703e3e5dc31b47f050c,30,and the man ran as fast as he could to the cabin.
66a64703e3e5dc31b47f050c,31,He was shouting 'open the door'
66a64703e3e5dc31b47f050c,32,"and the men opened the door,"
66a64703e3e5dc31b47f050c,33,the man took a sharp left
66a64703e3e5dc31b47f050c,34,and the bear ran in the cabin door.
66a64703e3e5dc31b47f050c,35,The man closed the cabin door from outside
66a64703e3e5dc31b47f050c,36,"and shouted 'here is your bear, now you skin him and I will get another one'."
66a64703e3e5dc31b47f050c,37,This happened 30 years ago
66a64703e3e5dc31b47f050c,38,"and although the 3 men said he stuck to his word,"
66a64703e3e5dc31b47f050c,39,they have never invited him hunting again.
5ca8eaf9bd0f9e0001c7d7fa,1,"The story was about someone and his three friends,"
5ca8eaf9bd0f9e0001c7d7fa,2,who he became friends with in high school.
5ca8eaf9bd0f9e0001c7d7fa,3,Prior to that high school he knew them as acquaintances
5ca8eaf9bd0f9e0001c7d7fa,4,as they were in different high schools before that
5ca8eaf9bd0f9e0001c7d7fa,5,and were all involved with athletics.
5ca8eaf9bd0f9e0001c7d7fa,6,They met or became friends in 1949.
5ca8eaf9bd0f9e0001c7d7fa,7,He lived on a farm
5ca8eaf9bd0f9e0001c7d7fa,8,and his friends lived in the city.
5ca8eaf9bd0f9e0001c7d7fa,9,"His friends would help him sometimes on the farm,"
5ca8eaf9bd0f9e0001c7d7fa,10,including with chores.
5ca8eaf9bd0f9e0001c7d7fa,11,"His friends liked to hunt,"
5ca8eaf9bd0f9e0001c7d7fa,12,"including squirrel hunting,"
5ca8eaf9bd0f9e0001c7d7fa,13,however he was not that interested in hunting.
5ca8eaf9bd0f9e0001c7d7fa,14,One of his friends suggested bear hunting in Canada.
5ca8eaf9bd0f9e0001c7d7fa,15,He went along with his friends for the experience.
5ca8eaf9bd0f9e0001c7d7fa,16,They got an aeroplane to Fort Wayne
5ca8eaf9bd0f9e0001c7d7fa,17,"then another aeroplane to Canada,"
5ca8eaf9bd0f9e0001c7d7fa,18,"did some backpacking,"
5ca8eaf9bd0f9e0001c7d7fa,19,used a canoe
5ca8eaf9bd0f9e0001c7d7fa,20,and they stayed in a cabin.
5ca8eaf9bd0f9e0001c7d7fa,21,They played card games etc. in that cabin.
5ca8eaf9bd0f9e0001c7d7fa,22,He and his friends changed their minds about bear hunting
5ca8eaf9bd0f9e0001c7d7fa,23,however one of his friends mentioned that if they did not hunt a bear then it would let down the expectations of other people.
5ca8eaf9bd0f9e0001c7d7fa,24,It was decided that whoever out of them got the highest card would be the one to bear hunt
5ca8eaf9bd0f9e0001c7d7fa,25,and the others would skin etc. the bear.
5ca8eaf9bd0f9e0001c7d7fa,26,"He, the one out of them who did not want to bear hunt in the first place, got the highest card."
5ca8eaf9bd0f9e0001c7d7fa,27,He went with a gun to go bear hunting
5ca8eaf9bd0f9e0001c7d7fa,28,and after a while spotted a bear which was bigger than any he had seen in photos.
5ca8eaf9bd0f9e0001c7d7fa,29,He tried using that gun to shoot the bear
5ca8eaf9bd0f9e0001c7d7fa,30,however realised that the gun was not loaded.
5ca8eaf9bd0f9e0001c7d7fa,31,The bear was not happy that he was on their territory
5ca8eaf9bd0f9e0001c7d7fa,32,and quickly chased him.
5ca8eaf9bd0f9e0001c7d7fa,33,He got to the cabin
5ca8eaf9bd0f9e0001c7d7fa,34,and shouted at his friends to let him in.
5ca8eaf9bd0f9e0001c7d7fa,35,He eventually got away from the bear.
65be59f9d75c57ef759fd8d1,1,"Four athletic friends, who had known each other through school and college went on a bear hunt."
65be59f9d75c57ef759fd8d1,2,One of the friends grew up in the countryside on a farm and the other three lived in the city.
65be59f9d75c57ef759fd8d1,3,The three city boys would often visit the friend at the farm as they enjoyed the outdoor life.
65be59f9d75c57ef759fd8d1,4,"The farm boy, although not excited by hunting, would take his friends hunting for squirrels and rabbits, to please them."
65be59f9d75c57ef759fd8d1,5,"When the three city boys suggested going on a bear hunt, the farm boy felt obliged."
65be59f9d75c57ef759fd8d1,6,After flying to the forest and hiking 500 miles they reached a cabin to stay in.
65be59f9d75c57ef759fd8d1,7,The forest looked spooky and neither of them wanted to risk hunting for a bear.
65be59f9d75c57ef759fd8d1,8,"After three or four days, they decided the shame of going home without a bear was too much."
65be59f9d75c57ef759fd8d1,9,"They drew cards to decide who would go and hunt the bear, with the other three required to butcher and skin the bear."
65be59f9d75c57ef759fd8d1,10,"The farm boy, who was not keen on the bear hunt in the first place, drew the highest card and unwillingly took the gun and went to find a bear."
65be59f9d75c57ef759fd8d1,11,"After a while he came upon the largest bear he had ever seen, in real life or photo."
65be59f9d75c57ef759fd8d1,12,"The bear was clearly not happy about him being on his territory and as he made towards him, the man tried to take a shot."
65be59f9d75c57ef759fd8d1,13,"However, the gun was not loaded and the man was forced to run for his life."
65be59f9d75c57ef759fd8d1,14,He approached the cabin as the bear was gaining on him.
65be59f9d75c57ef759fd8d1,15,The man shouted to his friends to open the cabin door.
65be59f9d75c57ef759fd8d1,16,"The man turned at the last minute, just to see the bear enter the cabin."
65be59f9d75c57ef759fd8d1,17,"The man said ""Here's the bear for you, like you asked. I am going back out to find another""."
65be59f9d75c57ef759fd8d1,18,"Unsurprisingly, the three city boys never asked the farm boy to ever go hunting again."
5ea2d9b1159f0e2092bc0210,1,"Four friends, all met in school."
5ea2d9b1159f0e2092bc0210,2,"One from the farm, three from the city."
5ea2d9b1159f0e2092bc0210,3,"They enjoyed hunting at the one friend's farm, all except the farm boy."
5ea2d9b1159f0e2092bc0210,4,"They decided to go bear hunting in Canada, all wanted to go except the farm boy."
5ea2d9b1159f0e2092bc0210,5,"They took a plane to Canada, went on a canoe then backpacked to their rented cabin."
5ea2d9b1159f0e2092bc0210,6,"Once they got there, they realised they didn't really want to go hunting at all."
5ea2d9b1159f0e2092bc0210,7,"So they sat in the cabin, playing cards and having a nice time."
5ea2d9b1159f0e2092bc0210,8,"They then thought, we need to shoot a bear otherwise the people back home will think they failed."
5ea2d9b1159f0e2092bc0210,9,So they decide to draw cards to see who will go.
5ea2d9b1159f0e2092bc0210,10,"The farm boy pulls the high card, so he must go to the woods to shoot a bear."
5ea2d9b1159f0e2092bc0210,11,While the others will skin and prepare it to take it home.
5ea2d9b1159f0e2092bc0210,12,"Off the boy goes into the woods, and he comes across an enormous bear."
5ea2d9b1159f0e2092bc0210,13,"He pulls the trigger on his gun, but has forgotten to load it."
5ea2d9b1159f0e2092bc0210,14,The bear then chases the boy all the way back to the cabin.
5ea2d9b1159f0e2092bc0210,15,He manages to get in the cabin and lock the bear outside.
5ea2d9b1159f0e2092bc0210,16,"And says to his friends ""I brought you the bear, now its your turn to skin it!"""
5ea2d9b1159f0e2092bc0210,17,This story took place 30 years ago.
5ea2d9b1159f0e2092bc0210,18,And they have not been on a hunting trip again since.
66634d3d893aa52a324be299,1,This is a story about me and some friends.
66634d3d893aa52a324be299,2,We met back in 1949.
66634d3d893aa52a324be299,3,We were in school together.
66634d3d893aa52a324be299,4,"When we graduated, we all went off to school."
66634d3d893aa52a324be299,5,We found out that we were in the same school.
66634d3d893aa52a324be299,6,The four of us became good friends.
66634d3d893aa52a324be299,7,Now I’m a farm boy.
66634d3d893aa52a324be299,8,I grew up on a farm.
66634d3d893aa52a324be299,9,The other three were city guys.
66634d3d893aa52a324be299,10,They’d come over to help out at the farm.
66634d3d893aa52a324be299,11,"Although I didn’t enjoy it much, I went along with them to be with the group."
66634d3d893aa52a324be299,12,They loved hunting rabbits.
66634d3d893aa52a324be299,13,I’d join them.
66634d3d893aa52a324be299,14,One day they mentioned that they wanted to hunt a bear up in Canada.
66634d3d893aa52a324be299,15,I wasn’t really thrilled at the idea.
66634d3d893aa52a324be299,16,I had no real reason as to why we couldn’t go.
66634d3d893aa52a324be299,17,So we packed up and make our way to Canada.
66634d3d893aa52a324be299,18,We landed in the water.
66634d3d893aa52a324be299,19,We then canoed as far as we could go.
66634d3d893aa52a324be299,20,"When we got to land, we had to walk 500 miles it seemed like."
66634d3d893aa52a324be299,21,"When we got to the cabin, the forest was spooky."
66634d3d893aa52a324be299,22,None of the guys wanted to venture outside.
66634d3d893aa52a324be299,23,We stayed there for three or four days.
66634d3d893aa52a324be299,24,We played cards.
66634d3d893aa52a324be299,25,We ate.
66634d3d893aa52a324be299,26,We slept.
66634d3d893aa52a324be299,27,One of the guys mentioned that we needed to bring a bear back since a lot of people knew we were coming to hunt bears.
66634d3d893aa52a324be299,28,Now no one was looking to be the guy that went out in the spooky woods trying to hunt a bear.
66634d3d893aa52a324be299,29,So me being the farmer went out into the woods.
66634d3d893aa52a324be299,30,The others were going to skin the bear and prep it to take back with us.
66634d3d893aa52a324be299,31,"When I went outside, I saw the biggest bear anyone’s ever seen."
66634d3d893aa52a324be299,32,I turned around and started back towards the cabin.
66634d3d893aa52a324be299,33,I thought I was fast.
66634d3d893aa52a324be299,34,The bear was gaining.
66634d3d893aa52a324be299,35,"As I got close to the cabin I started yelling OPEN THE DOOR, OPEN THE DOOR."
66634d3d893aa52a324be299,36,"When the guys opened the door, I took a quick left."
66634d3d893aa52a324be299,37,I quickly shut the door behind the bear.
66634d3d893aa52a324be299,38,"I shouted out, SKIN THE BEAR, I’LL GO FIND US ANOTHER ONE."
66634d3d893aa52a324be299,39,Now this was 30 years ago.
66634d3d893aa52a324be299,40,Can you imagine that not one of the guys asked me to go hunting with them since then?
5f61371454efa10bdcfc588d,1,"I have3 friends that I have know since school days,"
5f61371454efa10bdcfc588d,2,although we didn't go to the same schools we would meet at events because we were all athletes.
5f61371454efa10bdcfc588d,3,We did all meet up as we attended the same college.
5f61371454efa10bdcfc588d,4,"The other 3 guys we all from the city, but I was from a rural farm."
5f61371454efa10bdcfc588d,5,They all used to enjoy visiting the farm to help out as they were all quite physical.
5f61371454efa10bdcfc588d,6,They also like to go hunting for rabbits and the like.
5f61371454efa10bdcfc588d,7,"Although, even growing up on a farm I did not like hunting."
5f61371454efa10bdcfc588d,8,We would often meet up.
5f61371454efa10bdcfc588d,9,But after several years one of the guys said about going bear hunting.
5f61371454efa10bdcfc588d,10,"Even thought this was not something I liked, I agreed to go as we are all part of the group and I didn't have a good excuse."
5f61371454efa10bdcfc588d,11,"So they planned a trip to the north woods in Canada, we flew up from Fort Wayne and landed on a lake."
5f61371454efa10bdcfc588d,12,"We hired some canoes to paddle as far as wee could, seemed like over a day."
5f61371454efa10bdcfc588d,13,We then left the canoes and had a long hike to an old cabin they had rented.
5f61371454efa10bdcfc588d,14,It seems like we must have hiked hundreds of miles.
5f61371454efa10bdcfc588d,15,"We settled into the cabin but didn't like the look of the woods, we all found it a bit spooky."
5f61371454efa10bdcfc588d,16,So much that we would not go outside at night.
5f61371454efa10bdcfc588d,17,We just chatted and played cards for several days.
5f61371454efa10bdcfc588d,18,"When it got near to the time of leaving, one of the guys thought we would be embarrassed not returning with a bear."
5f61371454efa10bdcfc588d,19,As a group we decided to cut a deck of cards to decide who would hunt for a bear before I return.
5f61371454efa10bdcfc588d,20,"As you might guess I was the one who drew the high card, the one who didn't like hunting."
5f61371454efa10bdcfc588d,21,"I had to follow through, so it was agreed I would hunt the bear and the rest would skin and butcher the bear."
5f61371454efa10bdcfc588d,22,"I wen out with the old rifle to hunt a bear, it seemed like I wasn't going to find one."
5f61371454efa10bdcfc588d,23,"But I heard a noise and turned around to see a huge bear, the biggest bear I had seen even in pictures."
5f61371454efa10bdcfc588d,24,"I raised the rifle , aimed at the bear and pulled the trigger."
5f61371454efa10bdcfc588d,25,"Nothing, I had forgotten to load the rifle."
5f61371454efa10bdcfc588d,26,"The bear decided it was going to defend its territory and started towards me, I just turned and ran as fast as I could towards the cabin."
5f61371454efa10bdcfc588d,27,Even though in good shape the bear was gaining.
5f61371454efa10bdcfc588d,28,"Finally the cabin was inside, I shouted for help, called for them to open the door."
5f61371454efa10bdcfc588d,29,The bear was almost on me as a reached the door.
5f61371454efa10bdcfc588d,30,"But rather than go in i swerved to the left of the door, the bear couldn't stop and ran straight into the cabin."
5f61371454efa10bdcfc588d,31,"I quickly closed the door and called to the guys, over to you, I have hunted the bear, now it is your turn to process the bear."
5f61371454efa10bdcfc588d,32,This is what happened over 30 years ago.
5f61371454efa10bdcfc588d,33,They have never asked me to go hunting with them since.
62e94c384f809b7d0831f4ea,1,A bunch of high school friends
62e94c384f809b7d0831f4ea,2,who became friends in adult time
62e94c384f809b7d0831f4ea,3,went hunting in Canada.
62e94c384f809b7d0831f4ea,4,They hired a cabin in the woods
62e94c384f809b7d0831f4ea,5,and didnt go out hunting
62e94c384f809b7d0831f4ea,6,because they were all too scared
62e94c384f809b7d0831f4ea,7,until one day
62e94c384f809b7d0831f4ea,8,they played a game of high card
62e94c384f809b7d0831f4ea,9,to decide who goes hunting.
62e94c384f809b7d0831f4ea,10,The story teller got the high card
62e94c384f809b7d0831f4ea,11,"and went out to find a bear,"
62e94c384f809b7d0831f4ea,12,the gun wasnt loaded
62e94c384f809b7d0831f4ea,13,so he didnt kill it
62e94c384f809b7d0831f4ea,14,but instead got chased to the cabin
62e94c384f809b7d0831f4ea,15,where he managed to get in
62e94c384f809b7d0831f4ea,16,but the bear was outside.
62e94c384f809b7d0831f4ea,17,no more invites to the hunting parties were made.
60250e892b5c5727eeeef076,1,A group of four friends who had met long before college had a planned a bear hunt.
60250e892b5c5727eeeef076,2,Three were from the city and one was from a farm background.
60250e892b5c5727eeeef076,3,All of them were of strong build and liked to help out on the farm and hunt squirrels and other small creatures.
60250e892b5c5727eeeef076,4,In 1949 they planned a bear hunt despite the boy from the farming background being indifferent to the trip.
60250e892b5c5727eeeef076,5,They flew up from Fort Worth into Canada with a view to canoeing up to the Great North Woods.
60250e892b5c5727eeeef076,6,They canoed some great distance and then backpacked up to a cabin that they had rented.
60250e892b5c5727eeeef076,7,The bulk of the time they played cards and did not go out at night.
60250e892b5c5727eeeef076,8,They felt that they had to have some thing to bring back and drew cards to decide who would go out and get the bear.
60250e892b5c5727eeeef076,9,The farm boy went out but had not loaded his rifle.
60250e892b5c5727eeeef076,10,He found a bear that chased him all the way back to the cabin.
60250e892b5c5727eeeef076,11,He yelled to them to open the cabin door and the bear rushed into the cabin.
60250e892b5c5727eeeef076,12,He announced that he had delivered the bear and joked that he was going back for another one.
60250e892b5c5727eeeef076,13,Years later they laughed but he remarked that he was never asked to go on another bear hunt.
5ea07f2c55a2bd050fd8f70b,1,We were all friends the four of us from school.
5ea07f2c55a2bd050fd8f70b,2,I lived on the farm and my buddies were from the city.
5ea07f2c55a2bd050fd8f70b,3,They liked to come to the farm after we went to college and they wanted to do some hunting.
5ea07f2c55a2bd050fd8f70b,4,"Even though I was from a farm, I was not a fan of hunting but I went along when we went hunting for squirrels etc."
5ea07f2c55a2bd050fd8f70b,5,"As we grew older, someone suggested that we go bear hunting in Canada."
5ea07f2c55a2bd050fd8f70b,6,The other three were mad keen but I was not but allowed them to talk me into it.
5ea07f2c55a2bd050fd8f70b,7,We took a plane way up north then had to travel a further 500 miles to our hut in the woods.
5ea07f2c55a2bd050fd8f70b,8,By this time my 3 friends were not as mad keen as they were about hunting bear.
5ea07f2c55a2bd050fd8f70b,9,We sat around eating and playing cards however we knew that because we had talked about bear hunting so much before we came we knew we had to take one back or we would be totally ridiculed on our return.
5ea07f2c55a2bd050fd8f70b,10,We decided whoever had the highest card number was the one to hunt the bear needless to say I was the guy who ended up with the job.
5ea07f2c55a2bd050fd8f70b,11,"When I eventually came across a bear, I could not believe how big it was when I fired my gun I had forgot to load it so had to make a run for it chased by the bear."
5ea07f2c55a2bd050fd8f70b,12,"I eventually got back to the cabin, opened the door and left my friends to deal with the bear."
5ea07f2c55a2bd050fd8f70b,13,Needless to say my friends have never asked to go hunting again.
6554cfc335ac9ff968a5f162,1,"Three friends who met in 1949,"
6554cfc335ac9ff968a5f162,2,"who used to be athletes,"
6554cfc335ac9ff968a5f162,3,decided to bear hunting.
6554cfc335ac9ff968a5f162,4,One friend was reluctantly persuaded to join in.
6554cfc335ac9ff968a5f162,5,"For a while they used to hunt rabbits and squirrels,"
6554cfc335ac9ff968a5f162,6,but then decided to take a holiday to a cabin in the woods to hunt a bear.
6554cfc335ac9ff968a5f162,7,Nobody could be bothered to go out in the spooky woods to find a bear for three or four days
6554cfc335ac9ff968a5f162,8,so they just say around the campfire playing cards and talking.
6554cfc335ac9ff968a5f162,9,Eventually they decided that they have to find a bear
6554cfc335ac9ff968a5f162,10,otherwise they'd be given a hard time if they returned empty-handed.
6554cfc335ac9ff968a5f162,11,"The three friends decided to cut the deck,"
6554cfc335ac9ff968a5f162,12,and the person who drew the highest card had to go and find a bear.
6554cfc335ac9ff968a5f162,13,The friend that didn't really enjoy hunting drew the highest card.
6554cfc335ac9ff968a5f162,14,"Off he went to find a bear,"
6554cfc335ac9ff968a5f162,15,"Eventually, he turned around to see the biggest bear of his life standing in front of him."
6554cfc335ac9ff968a5f162,16,"He pulled the trigger of the gun he was carrying,"
6554cfc335ac9ff968a5f162,17,but he'd forgotten to load the turkey.
6554cfc335ac9ff968a5f162,18,"So he ran all the way back to the cabin with the bear chasing him,"
6554cfc335ac9ff968a5f162,19,yelling at his friends as he approached to open the door.
6554cfc335ac9ff968a5f162,20,At the last minute he dodged the doorway and the bear ran straight into the cabin.
6554cfc335ac9ff968a5f162,21,He told his friends that they could skin the bear.
6554cfc335ac9ff968a5f162,22,His friends never invited him hunting again.
5cebd58ade266200191eaf7d,1,It’s about someone who is recalling his three college students.
5cebd58ade266200191eaf7d,2,They actually met a few years before that because his buddies used to like to visit him in the country.
5cebd58ade266200191eaf7d,3,They were in the city and he was in the country they like to go hunting.
5cebd58ade266200191eaf7d,4,He felt that this was pretty boring because he hunted all the time.
5cebd58ade266200191eaf7d,5,But then they decided to go up into Canada via canoes and tracking to a place way out in the woods and hunt bear.
5cebd58ade266200191eaf7d,6,He got the job of finding a bear because they couldn’t go home without one because that would look bad.
5cebd58ade266200191eaf7d,7,In the end an old bear run into the place they were staying.
5cebd58ade266200191eaf7d,8,He told his colleagues to it while he went and found another one.
66a6ed1943bf2623c0a91c1a,1,There were three friends
66a6ed1943bf2623c0a91c1a,2,that met in college
66a6ed1943bf2623c0a91c1a,3,and they became friends.
66a6ed1943bf2623c0a91c1a,4,After graduation they enrolled in school
66a6ed1943bf2623c0a91c1a,5,and then found out
66a6ed1943bf2623c0a91c1a,6,that the four of them were all now attending the same school
66a6ed1943bf2623c0a91c1a,7,and they became quite good friends.
66a6ed1943bf2623c0a91c1a,8,"He was a kid from the farm,"
66a6ed1943bf2623c0a91c1a,9,the other three guys all lived in the city.
66a6ed1943bf2623c0a91c1a,10,"Being the macho men they were,"
66a6ed1943bf2623c0a91c1a,11,they used to hunt rabbits and squirrels
66a6ed1943bf2623c0a91c1a,12,and also help in the chores.
66a6ed1943bf2623c0a91c1a,13,He never really enjoyed hunting.
66a6ed1943bf2623c0a91c1a,14,"Being born and raised in the farm,"
66a6ed1943bf2623c0a91c1a,15,the outdoors was not really exciting for him.
66a6ed1943bf2623c0a91c1a,16,"This was going on for several years,"
66a6ed1943bf2623c0a91c1a,17,they'll always come around to his farm for hunting.
66a6ed1943bf2623c0a91c1a,18,"After they've been acquainted for years,"
66a6ed1943bf2623c0a91c1a,19,one of them got the idea
66a6ed1943bf2623c0a91c1a,20,that they'd like to go bear hunting up in Canada.
66a6ed1943bf2623c0a91c1a,21,This wasn’t appealing to him
66a6ed1943bf2623c0a91c1a,22,and unfortunately did not find any good reason not to go.
66a6ed1943bf2623c0a91c1a,23,so they took an airplane from Fort Wayne
66a6ed1943bf2623c0a91c1a,24,"all the way up into Canada,"
66a6ed1943bf2623c0a91c1a,25,and then landed on a lake.
66a6ed1943bf2623c0a91c1a,26,"They got up in the cabin,"
66a6ed1943bf2623c0a91c1a,27,got and stored all their groceries.
66a6ed1943bf2623c0a91c1a,28,They has a discussion on playing a game
66a6ed1943bf2623c0a91c1a,29,that whosoever has the highest cards will go to hunt the bear.
66a6ed1943bf2623c0a91c1a,30,"Unfortunately, it had to be him,"
66a6ed1943bf2623c0a91c1a,31,who did not buy the idea of bear hunt in the first place.
66a6ed1943bf2623c0a91c1a,32,He took his gun
66a6ed1943bf2623c0a91c1a,33,went out for hunting.
66a6ed1943bf2623c0a91c1a,34,"The bear was coming close to him,"
66a6ed1943bf2623c0a91c1a,35,so he tried to shoot
66a6ed1943bf2623c0a91c1a,36,and then found out
66a6ed1943bf2623c0a91c1a,37,that the gun was not loaded
66a6ed1943bf2623c0a91c1a,38,and began to run back.
60b7e1bcfe148de04d17624b,1,This is a story about a farm boy and three other guys from the city.
60b7e1bcfe148de04d17624b,2,They went to the same school.
60b7e1bcfe148de04d17624b,3,The farm boy's friends went to his farm to help him with the farm chores.
60b7e1bcfe148de04d17624b,4,They loved hunting on the farm.
60b7e1bcfe148de04d17624b,5,"Since he was an outdoor person, he was not that excited about what his friends enjoyed doing at the farm with him."
60b7e1bcfe148de04d17624b,6,One day they went out bear hunting.
60b7e1bcfe148de04d17624b,7,All they could do was play cards and stay indoors.
60b7e1bcfe148de04d17624b,8,Until one of them said that they told everyone that they went bear hunting.
60b7e1bcfe148de04d17624b,9,It looked somewhat like they go home hunting.
60b7e1bcfe148de04d17624b,10,So they played until the farm guy got the high.
60b7e1bcfe148de04d17624b,11,He did not want to go hunting.
60b7e1bcfe148de04d17624b,12,But he let them talk him into it.
60b7e1bcfe148de04d17624b,13,"Now that he got a high card, he had to live up to it."
60b7e1bcfe148de04d17624b,14,He took his gun and went hunting.
60b7e1bcfe148de04d17624b,15,"As he walked up into the spooky place, he saw one big old bear that he had never seen before."
60b7e1bcfe148de04d17624b,16,He fired at it.
60b7e1bcfe148de04d17624b,17,Nothing happened.
60b7e1bcfe148de04d17624b,18,He saw he did not load it.
60b7e1bcfe148de04d17624b,19,So he ran back to the cabin as fast as he could.
60b7e1bcfe148de04d17624b,20,The bear was running very fast.
60b7e1bcfe148de04d17624b,21,"He thought he used to be fast, but this time."
60b7e1bcfe148de04d17624b,22,"As he was approaching the cabin, he shouted at his friend to open the door."
60b7e1bcfe148de04d17624b,23,They opened and he got in.
60b7e1bcfe148de04d17624b,24,The bear got so close.
60b7e1bcfe148de04d17624b,25,That happened 30 years ago.
60b7e1bcfe148de04d17624b,26,Since then his friends never asked him to go hunting again.
66504b23d4203a2c5cf1252d,1,The story was about a man and his three friends that started college in 1949.
66504b23d4203a2c5cf1252d,2,They had known each other before college even thought they had gone to different schools as they had often met at athletic meets.
66504b23d4203a2c5cf1252d,3,"The narrator of the story had grown up on a farm,"
66504b23d4203a2c5cf1252d,4,The other three friends came from city areas.
66504b23d4203a2c5cf1252d,5,"They would often meet and go to the farm to hunt small animals,"
66504b23d4203a2c5cf1252d,6,Even though the narrator did not enjoy hunting - he went along with it to please his macho city mates.
66504b23d4203a2c5cf1252d,7,One time they decided to go on a hunting trip to Canada to hunt bears.
66504b23d4203a2c5cf1252d,8,"So after a plane flight and a hike for what seemed like hundreds of miles over many days, they arrived at their cabin,"
66504b23d4203a2c5cf1252d,9,Set it up with groceries etc and settled in for a few days.
66504b23d4203a2c5cf1252d,10,"Eventually they decided they would have to go out to hunt for a bear,"
66504b23d4203a2c5cf1252d,11,Although by now they did not want to.
66504b23d4203a2c5cf1252d,12,"Realising they would have to go out hunting after telling so many people they were on a bear hunting trip,"
66504b23d4203a2c5cf1252d,13,They decided to draw cards to choose who would go out to hunt and kill the bear.
66504b23d4203a2c5cf1252d,14,The remaining three would skin and cut up the bear.
66504b23d4203a2c5cf1252d,15,The narrator drew the hunting card and was forced to head out with an old gun to find a bear.
66504b23d4203a2c5cf1252d,16,Eventually after hours of looking he spotted a very large bear -
66504b23d4203a2c5cf1252d,17,He drew the gun and tried to shoot it- but the gun was not loaded.
66504b23d4203a2c5cf1252d,18,"Startled, the bear charged at him..."
66504b23d4203a2c5cf1252d,19,"The narrator started sprinting back towards the cabin, with the bear closing in."
66504b23d4203a2c5cf1252d,20,"As he neared the cabin, he called out 'open the door'"
66504b23d4203a2c5cf1252d,21,"And as he was about to run into the cabin, he ran past the door -"
66504b23d4203a2c5cf1252d,22,The bear then ran in the door.
66504b23d4203a2c5cf1252d,23,"""I found the bear for you' he called out..."
66504b23d4203a2c5cf1252d,24,He was never invited on a bear hunt again!!
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,1,This is a story about me and three of my friends.
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,2,We knew each other back in 1949.
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,3,At one point we all attended the same high school.
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,4,We were athletes on the school team.
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,5,All the guys were the macho type.
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,6,They used to love to go hunting.
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,7,Reluctantly I would go with them.
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,8,They liked hunting squirrel and other small animals.
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,9,I didn't have much interest in hunting.
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,10,I grew up on a farm.
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,11,I was used to these activities.
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,12,I was no longer excited by them.
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,13,After a number of hunting trips the other guys suggested we all fly to Canada.
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,14,They wanted to try to hunt a bear.
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,15,Again I wasn't particularly keen to do this.
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,16,I agreed to go anyway.
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,17,We flew over to Canada out of Fort Wayne.
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,18,When we landed we had to paddle in canoes for what seemed like two days.
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,19,Once back on land we had to trek for a further 500 miles.
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,20,The guys had rented a cabin in the woods.
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,21,We had supplies for a few nights.
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,22,"The strange thing is, we didn't go hunting."
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,23,"We just stayed in the cabin, eating, sleeping and playing cards."
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,24,The woods were really spooky up there.
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,25,It seemed that the guys had lost all interest in hunting a bear.
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,26,So we just stayed in the cabin.
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,27,Towards to the end of our stay one of the guys said we're going to look stupid if we don't come back with a bear.
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,28,So we decided to draw cards to see who would venture into the woods to kill the bear.
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,29,The other guys would have the job of skinning and cutting the meat.
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,30,We drew our cards.
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,31,Can you believe it?
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,32,The guy who didn't want to go in the first place drew the bear card.
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,33,So out I went into the spooky woods.
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,34,I looked for a bear.
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,35,Suddenly I looked up and saw a bear.
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,36,It was huge.
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,37,I've never even seen a picture of a bear so big.
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,38,Here was one starring right at me.
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,39,I whipped up the shotgun.
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,40,I pulled the trigger.
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,41,But nothing happened.
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,42,Like a complete turkey I had only forgot to load the damn thing.
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,43,That bear was furious.
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,44,He did not want me on his turf.
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,45,So I turned and ran like hell.
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,46,I saw the cabin up ahead.
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,47,I screamed at the guys to open the door.
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,48,I jumped into the cabin.
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,49,I ran to the left.
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,50,"Then shouted, here's the bear I promised."
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,51,That was over thirty years ago.
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,52,Do you know what?
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,53,Those guys have never asked me to come hunting since!
5ba3dde51ce477000117a55e,1,"There were 4 friends who all met at school in 1949,"
5ba3dde51ce477000117a55e,2,but all went to different schools growing up.
5ba3dde51ce477000117a55e,3,1 grew up on a farm
5ba3dde51ce477000117a55e,4,and 3 lived in the city.
5ba3dde51ce477000117a55e,5,"The 3 from the city used to like to go to the other friend's farm to hunt squirrels and rabbits,"
5ba3dde51ce477000117a55e,6,but the friend from the farm didn't care much for hunting.
5ba3dde51ce477000117a55e,7,The 3 friends from the city suggested going hiking in the mountains to hunt bears.
5ba3dde51ce477000117a55e,8,The friend from the farm did not want to go
5ba3dde51ce477000117a55e,9,but agreed to go anyway to be part of the group.
5ba3dde51ce477000117a55e,10,They travelled by canoe for about a day and a half
5ba3dde51ce477000117a55e,11,"and then hiked what appeared to be another 500 miles, according to the friend from the farm"
5ba3dde51ce477000117a55e,12,and stayed in a cabin.
5ba3dde51ce477000117a55e,13,After 3 or 4 days they had not ventured out to hunt a bear
5ba3dde51ce477000117a55e,14,as none of them really wanted to.
5ba3dde51ce477000117a55e,15,One of the friends said they needed to go home with a bear
5ba3dde51ce477000117a55e,16,as a lot of people knew they were coming to hunt bears
5ba3dde51ce477000117a55e,17,"and would give them a hard time about it if they came home empty handed,"
5ba3dde51ce477000117a55e,18,so they agreed to get a bear.
5ba3dde51ce477000117a55e,19,They cut cards to decide which of them would go and get the bear
5ba3dde51ce477000117a55e,20,and the remaining 3 friends would skin it.
5ba3dde51ce477000117a55e,21,"The friend from the farm, who did not even want to go hunting, drew the card"
5ba3dde51ce477000117a55e,22,which meant he had to go and get the bear.
5ba3dde51ce477000117a55e,23,"He found a bear, the biggest he'd ever seen,"
5ba3dde51ce477000117a55e,24,and went to shoot it with his gun
5ba3dde51ce477000117a55e,25,"but had forgotten to load it,"
5ba3dde51ce477000117a55e,26,so started running away from the bear.
5ba3dde51ce477000117a55e,27,"The bear chased him back to the cabin,"
5ba3dde51ce477000117a55e,28,and they ended up trapping the bear inside the cabin.
5ba3dde51ce477000117a55e,29,The friend who went to get the bear told the others to get on with their part of the deal
5ba3dde51ce477000117a55e,30,and he would go and get another one.
5ba3dde51ce477000117a55e,31,The friends from the city never invited the friend from the farm hunting again.
5b119f161e55760001b9daac,1,"A group of college friends that met prior to 1949,"
5b119f161e55760001b9daac,2,originally acquainted through high school sports
5b119f161e55760001b9daac,3,and ended up going to the same college.
5b119f161e55760001b9daac,4,1 farm boy and 3 city boys.
5b119f161e55760001b9daac,5,They all used to go out
5b119f161e55760001b9daac,6,"and hang out together on the farm,"
5b119f161e55760001b9daac,7,help with chores
5b119f161e55760001b9daac,8,and then go out hunting for rabbits and squirrels.
5b119f161e55760001b9daac,9,They got onto talking
5b119f161e55760001b9daac,10,and planning a visit to Canada
5b119f161e55760001b9daac,11,to go and hunt bears.
5b119f161e55760001b9daac,12,Farm boy didnt want to go
5b119f161e55760001b9daac,13,as he had no interest
5b119f161e55760001b9daac,14,but he did go as not to let the group down.
5b119f161e55760001b9daac,15,They stayed in an old cabin in the woods
5b119f161e55760001b9daac,16,"and all of them were quite unnerved by the general spookiness of the area,"
5b119f161e55760001b9daac,17,so they didnt go hunting at all.
5b119f161e55760001b9daac,18,"They stayed in and played cards,"
5b119f161e55760001b9daac,19,eating and drinking the days away.
5b119f161e55760001b9daac,20,They got to the last day
5b119f161e55760001b9daac,21,and had to pick cards as to who was actually going to go out
5b119f161e55760001b9daac,22,and find a bear for them to take back with them.
5b119f161e55760001b9daac,23,Farm boy got the highest card
5b119f161e55760001b9daac,24,"so had to go out looking for a bear,"
5b119f161e55760001b9daac,25,even though he hadnt wanted to go on the trip at all in the first place!
5b119f161e55760001b9daac,26,"He had an old gun from the cabin with him,"
5b119f161e55760001b9daac,27,and eventually came across a bear.
5b119f161e55760001b9daac,28,He turned to shoot the bear
5b119f161e55760001b9daac,29,and had actually forgotten to load the gun!
5b119f161e55760001b9daac,30,"He started running as the bear chased him down,"
5b119f161e55760001b9daac,31,as fast as he could run to try and get back to the cabin.
5b119f161e55760001b9daac,32,"He shouted out for the other guys to open the door,"
5b119f161e55760001b9daac,33,and as he got to the door he stepped aside
5b119f161e55760001b9daac,34,and the bear ran into the cabin where the guys were.
5b119f161e55760001b9daac,35,He closed the door on them!
5b119f161e55760001b9daac,36,"He said he has not been asked on a hunting trip ever since,"
5b119f161e55760001b9daac,37,and this was 30+ years ago now.
6671897ccb0249a1474a5656,1,"I met my friends in 1949,"
6671897ccb0249a1474a5656,2,before that at school actually.
6671897ccb0249a1474a5656,3,I grew up on a farm
6671897ccb0249a1474a5656,4,and the other 3 were city boys.
6671897ccb0249a1474a5656,5,We were all macho
6671897ccb0249a1474a5656,6,and the other 3 liked coming over to the farm
6671897ccb0249a1474a5656,7,and go hunting.
6671897ccb0249a1474a5656,8,I didn’t like hunting
6671897ccb0249a1474a5656,9,but I went with them because I was part of the group.
6671897ccb0249a1474a5656,10,One of them suggested going north
6671897ccb0249a1474a5656,11,"and bear hunting,"
6671897ccb0249a1474a5656,12,I really didn’t want to
6671897ccb0249a1474a5656,13,but I left them talk me into it.
6671897ccb0249a1474a5656,14,We all went up
6671897ccb0249a1474a5656,15,and ended up changing our minds because it was spooky up there.
6671897ccb0249a1474a5656,16,Eventually we decided we couldn’t go home without a bear.
6671897ccb0249a1474a5656,17,I got the high card
6671897ccb0249a1474a5656,18,and had to go bear hunting.
6671897ccb0249a1474a5656,19,I found one
6671897ccb0249a1474a5656,20,but forgot to load the gun
6671897ccb0249a1474a5656,21,so I started running
6671897ccb0249a1474a5656,22,and it chased me to the cabin!
6671897ccb0249a1474a5656,23,I shouted ‘OPEN THE DOOR’
6671897ccb0249a1474a5656,24,"and they did,"
6671897ccb0249a1474a5656,25,I ran as fast as I could
6671897ccb0249a1474a5656,26,"and they opened the door,"
6671897ccb0249a1474a5656,27,the bear ran in
6671897ccb0249a1474a5656,28,and I went left.
6671897ccb0249a1474a5656,29,"I shouted ‘there you go boys, he’s in there, you skin it and I’ll go get another one’"
6671897ccb0249a1474a5656,30,they never asked me to go hunting again.
665c7ba6b596a3558adbf2ec,1,A story about a man and his three friends who he first met in 1949.
665c7ba6b596a3558adbf2ec,2,He recalls how they ended up going to the same college and their hunting trip.
665c7ba6b596a3558adbf2ec,3,He grew up on a farm but he never really liked the outdoors.
665c7ba6b596a3558adbf2ec,4,"His friends liked hunting for squirrels, which he never liked but he just went with them cause he didn't want to be left out."
665c7ba6b596a3558adbf2ec,5,"They came up with the idea to go and hunt for bears in Canada, which he also went along with."
665c7ba6b596a3558adbf2ec,6,They stayed in the cabin for three or four days cause they were too scared to go outside of the cabin.
665c7ba6b596a3558adbf2ec,7,"One of his friends spoke up and said, 'they couldn't go back empty-handed because the locals would talk about them not bringing back a bear'."
665c7ba6b596a3558adbf2ec,8,They decided to play a game of cards to decide who would go out and hunt the bear.
665c7ba6b596a3558adbf2ec,9,The man picked the hunt card and he ventured out to hunt down a bear.
665c7ba6b596a3558adbf2ec,10,"When he came across a bear, he realised that his gun was unloaded so he ran towards the cabin and shouted for his friends to open the door to the cabin."
665c7ba6b596a3558adbf2ec,11,He ran inside and told them that he did his part and his friends should do theirs.
665c7ba6b596a3558adbf2ec,12,It has been 50 years since the incident and none of his friends have ever talked about hunting again.
563a76bfbe9cac0005aab326,1,The story is set in 1949
563a76bfbe9cac0005aab326,2,the narrator met his friends at the same school
563a76bfbe9cac0005aab326,3,but they were from different backgrounds
563a76bfbe9cac0005aab326,4,as he grew up on a farm
563a76bfbe9cac0005aab326,5,and they didn't.
563a76bfbe9cac0005aab326,6,They would come to the farm to hunt rabbits and squirrels
563a76bfbe9cac0005aab326,7,but the narrator wasn't so keen on this
563a76bfbe9cac0005aab326,8,but just went along with it.
563a76bfbe9cac0005aab326,9,Time went by
563a76bfbe9cac0005aab326,10,and the friends came up with the idea of going to Canada to hunt a bear.
563a76bfbe9cac0005aab326,11,Again the narrator wasn't keen
563a76bfbe9cac0005aab326,12,but was persuaded to go.
563a76bfbe9cac0005aab326,13,"They flew to Canada,"
563a76bfbe9cac0005aab326,14,took kayaks across the lake
563a76bfbe9cac0005aab326,15,and got to a cabin.
563a76bfbe9cac0005aab326,16,"They felt the place they were in was too spooky,"
563a76bfbe9cac0005aab326,17,none of them wanted to go out hunting in the end.
563a76bfbe9cac0005aab326,18,They stayed in for 3-4 days.
563a76bfbe9cac0005aab326,19,In the end they discussed how they would be mocked for not bringing a bear back
563a76bfbe9cac0005aab326,20,so split cards to see who should go hunting for one.
563a76bfbe9cac0005aab326,21,The narrator was chosen.
563a76bfbe9cac0005aab326,22,"He went out,"
563a76bfbe9cac0005aab326,23,saw a huge bear
563a76bfbe9cac0005aab326,24,but had forgotten to load his gun
563a76bfbe9cac0005aab326,25,so he ran away towards the cabin.
563a76bfbe9cac0005aab326,26,He yelled for the friends to open the door because he had a bear
563a76bfbe9cac0005aab326,27,and they did
563a76bfbe9cac0005aab326,28,but instead of going in he dashed to one side
563a76bfbe9cac0005aab326,29,and the bear went in the cabin.
563a76bfbe9cac0005aab326,30,They never forgot he had delivered a bear as agreed.
668936b212cea5becb2cf810,1,It was a story in the year 1949 about a guy who made friends in school.
668936b212cea5becb2cf810,2,These friends all loved hunting but him being someone raised to farm he didn't much love hunting and all.
668936b212cea5becb2cf810,3,So after school his friends decided to travel to Canada to go bear hunting.
668936b212cea5becb2cf810,4,"He didn't really like that idea but since he has been part of that group, they talked him into it."
668936b212cea5becb2cf810,5,"They got to Canada, landed on a lake took canoes and paddled about a day and half and backpacked for about five hundred miles too til they got to their cabin they had rented."
668936b212cea5becb2cf810,6,The place was way spooky that they forgot they had come to hunt bears rather they played cards and this went on for about 3 days where one of them came up with the idea they really had to go hunt a bear because they couldn't go home empty handed.
668936b212cea5becb2cf810,7,A decision was made about the person with the highest number of card going to hunt the bear and the remaining will butcher skin and pack him up.
668936b212cea5becb2cf810,8,Obviously he was the guy who ended up with the highest number.
668936b212cea5becb2cf810,9,He took an old turkey gun and set of the woods to hunt.
668936b212cea5becb2cf810,10,"He came across a big old looking bear and when he was ready to fire, the gun didn't because he had failed to load it back then."
668936b212cea5becb2cf810,11,"He had no other choice than to run, and by doing so the bear chased him all the way to the cabin where he screamed and shouted for them to let him in."
668936b212cea5becb2cf810,12,"Alas he got in and closed the door where he told his friends, there is your bear, you asked for it and i have done my part, now you guys go do your part."
668936b212cea5becb2cf810,13,All this happened thirty years ago and since then he hasn't been asked by his friends to go hunting again with them.
6658c7edb546329c14e47569,1,It was 1949
6658c7edb546329c14e47569,2,and he lived on a farm.
6658c7edb546329c14e47569,3,His friends liked to come to the farm
6658c7edb546329c14e47569,4,and hunt for rabbits.
6658c7edb546329c14e47569,5,They decided to go on holiday to Canada
6658c7edb546329c14e47569,6,to try and hunt bears.
6658c7edb546329c14e47569,7,The narrator didn't like hunting
6658c7edb546329c14e47569,8,but went on the holiday anyway.
6658c7edb546329c14e47569,9,They got a plane to Fort Wayne
6658c7edb546329c14e47569,10,and then had to canoe for a long time to get to the cabin.
6658c7edb546329c14e47569,11,The cabin was very spooky in the forest
6658c7edb546329c14e47569,12,and nobody wanted to go hunting anymore.
6658c7edb546329c14e47569,13,They sorted out all their groceries when they arrived.
6658c7edb546329c14e47569,14,"They stayed in the cabin for 3 to 4 days playing cards,"
6658c7edb546329c14e47569,15,and never ventured out at night.
6658c7edb546329c14e47569,16,"On the last day, they realised that they would have to hunt for a bear"
6658c7edb546329c14e47569,17,because otherwise people back home would tease them.
6658c7edb546329c14e47569,18,So they decided to play a card game to decide who would go out hunting.
6658c7edb546329c14e47569,19,"The narrator drew the highest card,"
6658c7edb546329c14e47569,20,so he had to go hunting.
6658c7edb546329c14e47569,21,He took his gun
6658c7edb546329c14e47569,22,and searched for a long time without seeing a bear.
6658c7edb546329c14e47569,23,Then he saw the biggest bear he'd ever seen.
6658c7edb546329c14e47569,24,He'd never seen a bear that big in pictures.
6658c7edb546329c14e47569,25,He went to shoot the bear
6658c7edb546329c14e47569,26,but realised his gun didn't have any bullets in it.
6658c7edb546329c14e47569,27,"His only choice was to run away from the bear,"
6658c7edb546329c14e47569,28,but the bear was very fast.
6658c7edb546329c14e47569,29,He used to be fast at running
6658c7edb546329c14e47569,30,but now he couldn't run faster than the bear.
6658c7edb546329c14e47569,31,He got near the cabin
6658c7edb546329c14e47569,32,"and shouted ""Open the door""."
6658c7edb546329c14e47569,33,His friends opened the door
6658c7edb546329c14e47569,34,and he managed to get into the house.
6658c7edb546329c14e47569,35,The bear was killed
6658c7edb546329c14e47569,36,and all his friends celebrated him.
6658c7edb546329c14e47569,37,They never went hunting together again.
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,1,This is a story about some college friends.
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,2,I got acquainted with some guys in college.
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,3,These guys loved to hunt... rabbits and deers and things.
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,4,"I am not the hunting type, but I usually went with them and entertained those ideas."
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,5,"Eventually, they started talking about hunting a bear, and finally convinced me to go with them."
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,6,"I was totally talked into going, even though I did not want to."
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,7,"Well, we travelled up north canada into some woods to hunt bears."
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,8,"The group of us canoed up into the woods as far as we could go, and then backpacked the ret of the way... what felt like 500 miles... to a cabin that they rented."
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,9,"It was a really spooky place, and when we were there no one felt like actually going out and hunting."
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,10,"We ended up sleeping, eating and playing cards for three or four days."
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,11,"On the fourth or fifth day, one guy piped up and said that we better not go home empty handed when everyone knew that we were coming to hunt some bears."
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,12,If we went home empty handed we would never hear the end of it.
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,13,"So we all decided that we would draw cards, and whoever got the highest would go out and hunt the bear, and the others would skin it and cut it into chunks to take home."
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,14,Guess who drew the highest card... the guy who DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO BE THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE.
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,15,But I had agreed to play the game.
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,16,So I took the gun and went out.
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,17,It felt like I had walked for hours and hours in those woods and found nothing.
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,18,"Eventually, I heard a noice behind me, I turned and saw the biggest bear I had ever seen."
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,19,I had never even seen a bear that big in a PICTURE.
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,20,And that old bear was not happy that I was in his territory.
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,21,"The only thing I could do was turn around and run run run, but that old bear was fast."
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,22,He was right on my tail.
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,23,"When the cabin was in sight I started yelling ""Open the door, open the door"", with the bear hot on my tail."
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,24,"The guys opened the door, but before going in I quickly turned to the left, but the bear went straight inside."
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,25,I closed the door and shouted THERE YOU HAVE YOUR BEAR.
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,26,"This story was thirty years ago, and who wouldve guessed that I have never been invited to go hunting with them again."
5eb12f8510e0ce205e7b25c7,1,"The narrator made some friends during his high school years when they were in the athletics clubs,"
5eb12f8510e0ce205e7b25c7,2,"and they ended up attending the same college, together."
5eb12f8510e0ce205e7b25c7,3,"The friends would often visit the narrator,"
5eb12f8510e0ce205e7b25c7,4,who lived on a farm.
5eb12f8510e0ce205e7b25c7,5,They'd go hunting during those trips.
5eb12f8510e0ce205e7b25c7,6,"Many years later, one of them suggested they fly to Canada and hunt down a bear."
5eb12f8510e0ce205e7b25c7,7,"So, they make the trip,"
5eb12f8510e0ce205e7b25c7,8,"which includes a flight a long hike to their cabin in the woods,"
5eb12f8510e0ce205e7b25c7,9,"but by the time they get there, nobody is really in the mood to hunt bears"
5eb12f8510e0ce205e7b25c7,10,"(especially the narrator, who wasn't interested in hunting, anyway)."
5eb12f8510e0ce205e7b25c7,11,"However, after a few days of just staying in the cabin, they realise that they'd need some kind of evidence that they'd been hunting bears to bring back home,"
5eb12f8510e0ce205e7b25c7,12,as they'd been bragging to all their other friends and families about it.
5eb12f8510e0ce205e7b25c7,13,"So, they decide to draw cards in order to determine which one of the group had to go out and hunt the bear, alone;"
5eb12f8510e0ce205e7b25c7,14,the narrator ends up having to do it.
5eb12f8510e0ce205e7b25c7,15,"So, he takes his gun"
5eb12f8510e0ce205e7b25c7,16,"and makes his way out into the woods,"
5eb12f8510e0ce205e7b25c7,17,where he eventually finds an enormous bear.
5eb12f8510e0ce205e7b25c7,18,"Unfortunately, he had forgotten to load the gun before going out,"
5eb12f8510e0ce205e7b25c7,19,and ends up running for his life as the bear chases him all the way back to the cabin.
5eb12f8510e0ce205e7b25c7,20,He gets his friends to open the door
5eb12f8510e0ce205e7b25c7,21,"and, if I recall correctly, he seems to instead lure the bear inside while he stays outside,"
5eb12f8510e0ce205e7b25c7,22,leaving his friends to kill and skin it.
5eb12f8510e0ce205e7b25c7,23,It's implied that everyone survived the ordeal.
62d138e361857aef127c9e8b,1,The individual became friends with 3 other people in 1949.
62d138e361857aef127c9e8b,2,They were all athletic people from different schools.

62d138e361857aef127c9e8b,4,They became friends.

62d138e361857aef127c9e8b,7,They wanted to go hunting.
62d138e361857aef127c9e8b,8,Initially they hunted squirrels.
62d138e361857aef127c9e8b,9,The storyteller didn't really care for this.
62d138e361857aef127c9e8b,10,He was used to this compared to the others.
62d138e361857aef127c9e8b,11,He wanted to fit in.
62d138e361857aef127c9e8b,12,They decided some years later to go bear hunting.
62d138e361857aef127c9e8b,13,The storyteller didn't want to go.
62d138e361857aef127c9e8b,14,He got roped into it.
62d138e361857aef127c9e8b,15,None wanted to actually hunt a bear.
62d138e361857aef127c9e8b,16,They decided to play a game to see who would.
62d138e361857aef127c9e8b,17,The reluctant storyteller was chosen.
62d138e361857aef127c9e8b,18,They found a bear.
62d138e361857aef127c9e8b,19,The gun wasn't loaded.
62d138e361857aef127c9e8b,20,They ran back to the cabin.
62d138e361857aef127c9e8b,21,They dodged the chasing bear.
62d138e361857aef127c9e8b,22,The bear ended up in the cabin with the others.
62d138e361857aef127c9e8b,23,The storyteller hasn't been invited to go hunting since.
665ae45b40ab88f807fbb981,1,"Four friends from school (the narrator from the farm and 3 from the city), who were athletes, decided to go to Canada to hunt bear"
665ae45b40ab88f807fbb981,2,"but they didn't actually hunt bear at first for reasons I forget,"
665ae45b40ab88f807fbb981,3,spooky cabin or something.
665ae45b40ab88f807fbb981,4,Just played cards instead.
665ae45b40ab88f807fbb981,5,Because they fear others they decided they should return with a dead bear
665ae45b40ab88f807fbb981,6,so using a high card decider the narrator who didn't want to do any of this got the metaphorical short straw.
665ae45b40ab88f807fbb981,7,"He found an old bear,"
665ae45b40ab88f807fbb981,8,took a shot with an unloaded gun
665ae45b40ab88f807fbb981,9,and they did the thing you must never ever do and that is run away from a bear.
665ae45b40ab88f807fbb981,10,He ran to the cabin
665ae45b40ab88f807fbb981,11,and I can't remember how it ends.
5ea040075511b505cf6ec1eb,1,There were 4 boys
5ea040075511b505cf6ec1eb,2,who started and finished schooling together.
5ea040075511b505cf6ec1eb,3,One lived on a farm
5ea040075511b505cf6ec1eb,4,and 3 were city boys.
5ea040075511b505cf6ec1eb,5,During their younger years the city boys spent a lot of time visiting the farm
5ea040075511b505cf6ec1eb,6,and hunting for rabbits and squirrels.
5ea040075511b505cf6ec1eb,7,They all enjoyed the outdoor life.
5ea040075511b505cf6ec1eb,8,Long after they left school the city boys decided it would be a good idea to go to Canada to hunt bear.
5ea040075511b505cf6ec1eb,9,"The farm boy wasn't at all keen,"
5ea040075511b505cf6ec1eb,10,but was persuaded to go.
5ea040075511b505cf6ec1eb,11,"The travelling took a long time by plane, canoe and a 500 mile walk to the north woods."
5ea040075511b505cf6ec1eb,12,They stayed in a cabin
5ea040075511b505cf6ec1eb,13,"but decided they really didn't want to shoot a bear,"
5ea040075511b505cf6ec1eb,14,"so they spent time eating, sleeping and playing cards."
5ea040075511b505cf6ec1eb,15,However it was decided that one of them should shoot a bear
5ea040075511b505cf6ec1eb,16,because everyone back home would expect them to come back with a trophy.
5ea040075511b505cf6ec1eb,17,They drew cards
5ea040075511b505cf6ec1eb,18,and the farm boy got the highest card
5ea040075511b505cf6ec1eb,19,and went out with his gun.
5ea040075511b505cf6ec1eb,20,A very large brown bear rose up in front of him
5ea040075511b505cf6ec1eb,21,"but although he took a shot, his gun wasn't loaded,"
5ea040075511b505cf6ec1eb,22,so he ran back to the hut
5ea040075511b505cf6ec1eb,23,and yelled at his friend to open the door
5ea040075511b505cf6ec1eb,24,"as he got there, he swerved to the right"
5ea040075511b505cf6ec1eb,25,and the bear ran into the cabin.
5ea040075511b505cf6ec1eb,26,Funnily enough his friends haven't invited to go shooting with them since!!!

660da4ba5e59df1fdae56a54,8,They went from Fort Wayne to North Canada (which was a long journey) to go bear hunting.

660da4ba5e59df1fdae56a54,10,Nobody wanted to hunt.
660da4ba5e59df1fdae56a54,11,It was spooky.

5fb2727f2942a58418fd0d2b,1,It happened in 1959 when they became friends.
5fb2727f2942a58418fd0d2b,2,They all lived in the city
5fb2727f2942a58418fd0d2b,3,and the one guy lived on the farm.
5fb2727f2942a58418fd0d2b,4,Initially they all went to different schools
5fb2727f2942a58418fd0d2b,5,and were good in athletics.
5fb2727f2942a58418fd0d2b,6,Then they all united in the same school.
5fb2727f2942a58418fd0d2b,7,The three guys were fascinated about farm life
5fb2727f2942a58418fd0d2b,8,and would always visit the farm.
5fb2727f2942a58418fd0d2b,9,The guy that lived on the farm was not keen on hunting bunnies and deer.
5fb2727f2942a58418fd0d2b,10,They decided to go bear hunting

5fb2727f2942a58418fd0d2b,13,They went on a canoe for several hours
5fb2727f2942a58418fd0d2b,14,until they reached Noor wood Canada as far as they could go.
5fb2727f2942a58418fd0d2b,15,They then hiked to the cabin.
5fb2727f2942a58418fd0d2b,16,"For several days they ate, sang and slept"
5fb2727f2942a58418fd0d2b,17,and no one wanted to go bear hunting.
5fb2727f2942a58418fd0d2b,18,Then they decided that people will be expecting a bear
5fb2727f2942a58418fd0d2b,19,so they cut the cards
5fb2727f2942a58418fd0d2b,20,and the one with the highest card would go out and find a bear.
5fb2727f2942a58418fd0d2b,21,The guy on the farm had to go bear hunting.
5fb2727f2942a58418fd0d2b,22,He went out into the woods
5fb2727f2942a58418fd0d2b,23,and couldn't see a bear
5fb2727f2942a58418fd0d2b,24,but then heard a noise

5fb2727f2942a58418fd0d2b,26,He pointed his rifle
5fb2727f2942a58418fd0d2b,27,and took a shot
5fb2727f2942a58418fd0d2b,28,but that turkey gun was not loaded.
5fb2727f2942a58418fd0d2b,29,The bear started running after him.
5fb2727f2942a58418fd0d2b,30,He ran to the cabin.
5fb2727f2942a58418fd0d2b,31,He took a left
5fb2727f2942a58418fd0d2b,32,and the bear took a right.
5fb2727f2942a58418fd0d2b,33,He shut the door
5fb2727f2942a58418fd0d2b,34,"and told the boys, here is the bear."
5fb2727f2942a58418fd0d2b,35,They need to cut and skin the bear.

667889a03a2f652ce630b4bd,6,The three friends talked about how they wanted to go bear hunting.
667889a03a2f652ce630b4bd,7,The main character was not keen but wanted to be a apart of the group so agreed.
667889a03a2f652ce630b4bd,8,They then flew from Fort Wayne to Canada and went to a big lake where they rented canoes.
667889a03a2f652ce630b4bd,9,"They then went to the North woods and in what seemed like 500 miles, got to an old cabin they rented."
667889a03a2f652ce630b4bd,10,For 3-4 days they did not want to go bear hunting as they found the woods spooky and did not go out at night.
667889a03a2f652ce630b4bd,11,One member of the group stated how they could not come back empty handed as they had told many people of their plans so they drew cards and agreed whoever got the high card would hunt the bear and the other three would skin it.

667889a03a2f652ce630b4bd,15,He screamed to his friends to open the cabin door and the bear went into the cabin.
667889a03a2f652ce630b4bd,16,The main character told them that he fulfilled his promise and they have to skin him now.
667889a03a2f652ce630b4bd,17,They still talk about this 30 years later.

5e7c8696aaaa890009345427,6,One day they decided to go to Canada on a bear hunting trip.

5e7c8696aaaa890009345427,10,"Once they got to the cabin in the north woods they decided none of them really wanted to hunt, so they stayed in the cabin and played cards and things."

5e7c8696aaaa890009345427,16,"The bear ran at the man, so he turned and ran fast back to the cabin."
5e7c8696aaaa890009345427,17,As he approached he yelled 'open the door' and the bear went into the cabin.
5e7c8696aaaa890009345427,18,They never went hunting again.

63f85b1c3124fd03faff2126,4,both rabbits and squirrels

63f85b1c3124fd03faff2126,6,they go to Canada for bear hunting.
63f85b1c3124fd03faff2126,7,"On getting there,"
63f85b1c3124fd03faff2126,8,the morale reduced
63f85b1c3124fd03faff2126,9,so they decided to use a card game
63f85b1c3124fd03faff2126,10,to decide who gets to hunt the bear.
63f85b1c3124fd03faff2126,11,"After choosing,"

63f85b1c3124fd03faff2126,13,but his gun wasn't loaded
63f85b1c3124fd03faff2126,14,then he ran to the cabin

66132ecbe7340e834ca1b3a3,11,"In a panic, he ran back to the cabin with the bear in pursuit,"
66132ecbe7340e834ca1b3a3,12,narrowly escaping by shutting the bear inside the cabin.
66132ecbe7340e834ca1b3a3,13,"Despite his bravery, his friends never invited him on another hunting trip."
5bc879d3836d560001fc421a,1,A boy met three other boys slightly before they all attended college together in 1949.
5bc879d3836d560001fc421a,2,The boy telling the story grew up on a farm.
5bc879d3836d560001fc421a,3,The other three grew up in the city.
5bc879d3836d560001fc421a,4,For this reason the city boys were quite keen on the idea of hunting.
5bc879d3836d560001fc421a,5,The farm boy was not so thrilled as this was quite normal to his general way of life.
5bc879d3836d560001fc421a,6,They would hunt together on his property.
5bc879d3836d560001fc421a,7,Even though the boy wasn't keen he did it to fit in with the group.
5bc879d3836d560001fc421a,8,One day they all decided to take a trip to northern Canada to try to hunt a bear.
5bc879d3836d560001fc421a,9,The boy was still not keen but was pressured to go with his group.
5bc879d3836d560001fc421a,10,They flew out of Fort Wayne and headed to northern Canada together.
5bc879d3836d560001fc421a,11,They went to some woods where they had rented a spooky looking cabin.
5bc879d3836d560001fc421a,12,For days the boys could not bring themselves to go and look for the bear as they were scared by their surrounding.
5bc879d3836d560001fc421a,13,So they played cards and drank and slept.
5bc879d3836d560001fc421a,14,Before they were due to come home they were worried that people would make fun of them if they came back and had not brought a bear.
5bc879d3836d560001fc421a,15,So they drew cards and the boy telling the story unfortunately drew the short straw (so to speak).
5bc879d3836d560001fc421a,16,He went out into the woods and found a bear.
5bc879d3836d560001fc421a,17,The bear chased him all the way back to the cabin.
5bc879d3836d560001fc421a,18,He let the bear into the cabin and said there you go boys there a bear to skin ill go and get another one.
5bc879d3836d560001fc421a,19,Surprisingly none of his friends ever invited him hunting again.
576020968ddaf40006ce9746,1,There were 4 friends that met at school.
576020968ddaf40006ce9746,2,The narrator was a farm boy and the other 3 from the city.
576020968ddaf40006ce9746,3,They admire the farm life especially hunting and used to hang out on the farm.
576020968ddaf40006ce9746,4,"The narrator would take them out hunting, even though he himself wasn't that interested."
576020968ddaf40006ce9746,5,They eventually decided they wanted to go bear hunting in Canada.
576020968ddaf40006ce9746,6,They hired a remote cabin that required them to travel (by canoe and hiking) for several days.
576020968ddaf40006ce9746,7,On arrival they got nervous as it all seemed very spooky.
576020968ddaf40006ce9746,8,They spent several days in the cabin playing cards.
576020968ddaf40006ce9746,9,Eventually one of them thought they would be made fun of if they returned without a bear.
576020968ddaf40006ce9746,10,So they cut the cards to decide who would go out and hunt.
576020968ddaf40006ce9746,11,It was the narrator.
576020968ddaf40006ce9746,12,He went hunting and on eventually finding a bear discovered that the gun wasn't loaded.
576020968ddaf40006ce9746,13,The bear chased him all the way back to the cabin.
576020968ddaf40006ce9746,14,He screamed at his colleagues to open the door.
576020968ddaf40006ce9746,15,They opened it and the bear ran in.
576020968ddaf40006ce9746,16,He shouted that they could skin the bear.
576020968ddaf40006ce9746,17,They agreed he'd lived up to his part of the bargain.
576020968ddaf40006ce9746,18,But they never invited him hunting again.
60b9f1fe58782eeab6372f1c,1,It was a story about a guy
60b9f1fe58782eeab6372f1c,2,and three of his friends
60b9f1fe58782eeab6372f1c,3,he met in 1949
60b9f1fe58782eeab6372f1c,4,"when they started college,"
60b9f1fe58782eeab6372f1c,5,"he had met them before this,"
60b9f1fe58782eeab6372f1c,6,they all went to the same school.
60b9f1fe58782eeab6372f1c,7,In high school they remained friends
60b9f1fe58782eeab6372f1c,8,as they were athletes in different schools.
60b9f1fe58782eeab6372f1c,9,He was from the farms
60b9f1fe58782eeab6372f1c,10,and the other 3 from the city.
60b9f1fe58782eeab6372f1c,11,After graduation they found out all four were going to the same college
60b9f1fe58782eeab6372f1c,12,and became good friends.
60b9f1fe58782eeab6372f1c,13,The narrator of the story was used to hunting
60b9f1fe58782eeab6372f1c,14,and the farm style of life
60b9f1fe58782eeab6372f1c,15,where the other three were not.
60b9f1fe58782eeab6372f1c,16,They would hunt squirrels and rabbits.
60b9f1fe58782eeab6372f1c,17,They would also help him with chores on the farm.
60b9f1fe58782eeab6372f1c,18,They then decided they would want to go hunt a bear.
60b9f1fe58782eeab6372f1c,19,They went for the trip
60b9f1fe58782eeab6372f1c,20,and stayed in a small cabin.
60b9f1fe58782eeab6372f1c,21,After days of no success
60b9f1fe58782eeab6372f1c,22,"eventually the narrator came across the bear,"
60b9f1fe58782eeab6372f1c,23,a very big one.
60b9f1fe58782eeab6372f1c,24,He had forgotten to load his gun
60b9f1fe58782eeab6372f1c,25,and was chased by the bear.
60b9f1fe58782eeab6372f1c,26,He ran as fast as he could back to the cabin
60b9f1fe58782eeab6372f1c,27,screaming for them to open the door.
60b9f1fe58782eeab6372f1c,28,This was 30 years ago
60b9f1fe58782eeab6372f1c,29,and he hasn't been invited to go on another trip again since.
573c6b96b3a71f00146df8c4,1,They all met in 1949
573c6b96b3a71f00146df8c4,2,and went to the same school
573c6b96b3a71f00146df8c4,3,and became friends.
573c6b96b3a71f00146df8c4,4,He lived on a farm
573c6b96b3a71f00146df8c4,5,and they lived in the city
573c6b96b3a71f00146df8c4,6,- they used to visit him on the farm
573c6b96b3a71f00146df8c4,7,and they liked to hunt
573c6b96b3a71f00146df8c4,8,but he didn't.
573c6b96b3a71f00146df8c4,9,They had an idea to go on a trip to Canada to hunt bears
573c6b96b3a71f00146df8c4,10,so they went there.
573c6b96b3a71f00146df8c4,11,They had to go across a lake to get to the woods
573c6b96b3a71f00146df8c4,12,and had to walk what felt like five hundred miles to get to their cabin.
573c6b96b3a71f00146df8c4,13,The walk was scary
573c6b96b3a71f00146df8c4,14,so it put them off wanting to go hunting for bears
573c6b96b3a71f00146df8c4,15,as they were all spooked out.
573c6b96b3a71f00146df8c4,16,So for a few days they just stayed in the cabin together
573c6b96b3a71f00146df8c4,17,and played cards.
573c6b96b3a71f00146df8c4,18,Then they realised that if they didn't bring back a bear people wouldn't believe them
573c6b96b3a71f00146df8c4,19,and would probably make fun of them.
573c6b96b3a71f00146df8c4,20,So they played the high cards game
573c6b96b3a71f00146df8c4,21,and who ever picked the highest card had to go and hunt the bear alone
573c6b96b3a71f00146df8c4,22,and bring it back to the cabin dead.
573c6b96b3a71f00146df8c4,23,The others would skin the bear
573c6b96b3a71f00146df8c4,24,and prepare it to take back as a trophy.
573c6b96b3a71f00146df8c4,25,The story teller got the high card
573c6b96b3a71f00146df8c4,26,so had to go out and hunt.
573c6b96b3a71f00146df8c4,27,"He went out and took a gun,"
573c6b96b3a71f00146df8c4,28,found a bear bigger than he'd even seen on pictures.
573c6b96b3a71f00146df8c4,29,He went to shoot it
573c6b96b3a71f00146df8c4,30,and realised that he hadn't loaded the gun
573c6b96b3a71f00146df8c4,31,so ran instead.
573c6b96b3a71f00146df8c4,32,He got back to the cabin just in time
573c6b96b3a71f00146df8c4,33,and slammed the door.
573c6b96b3a71f00146df8c4,34,They didn't go bear hunting again.
58945874b5496d00018cfe1c,1,Four friends from their childhood used to go hunting on a farm
58945874b5496d00018cfe1c,2,(three guys from the city).
58945874b5496d00018cfe1c,3,They decided to go bear hunting in Canada
58945874b5496d00018cfe1c,4,and hired a cabin in the wood
58945874b5496d00018cfe1c,5,which were spooky.
58945874b5496d00018cfe1c,6,Once of them who didn't even want to go hunting
58945874b5496d00018cfe1c,7,was chosen to hunt a bear
58945874b5496d00018cfe1c,8,for the others to skin.
58945874b5496d00018cfe1c,9,He found a big old bear
58945874b5496d00018cfe1c,10,but couldn't shoot it
58945874b5496d00018cfe1c,11,because he forgot to load the rifle.
58945874b5496d00018cfe1c,12,The bear chased him back to the cabin.
58945874b5496d00018cfe1c,13,He shouted to open the door
58945874b5496d00018cfe1c,14,and then swerved
58945874b5496d00018cfe1c,15,and the bear went inside!
5660c8ff9df648001102f010,1,He met a group of friends initially in school in 1949.
5660c8ff9df648001102f010,2,"He was a farm boy,"
5660c8ff9df648001102f010,3,they were city boys.
5660c8ff9df648001102f010,4,The friends liked to come out to the farm
5660c8ff9df648001102f010,5,"and do country related chores,"
5660c8ff9df648001102f010,6,hunting and such.
5660c8ff9df648001102f010,7,He never enjoyed it
5660c8ff9df648001102f010,8,as it wasn't a new experience for him
5660c8ff9df648001102f010,9,as it was for the city friends.
5660c8ff9df648001102f010,10,One day they decided to go to Canada
5660c8ff9df648001102f010,11,and got a flight there to hunt for bears.
5660c8ff9df648001102f010,12,They hiked for a long time
5660c8ff9df648001102f010,13,and arrived at a cabin in the north woods.
5660c8ff9df648001102f010,14,They decided they didn't want to go bear hunting
5660c8ff9df648001102f010,15,but had to do something
5660c8ff9df648001102f010,16,because they told everyone they'd go near hunting
5660c8ff9df648001102f010,17,so thought they had to go back with a bear.
5660c8ff9df648001102f010,18,They cut the cards to decide who would hunt for the bear
5660c8ff9df648001102f010,19,and the rest would skin and prepare the bear for taking home.
5660c8ff9df648001102f010,20,He went to find a bear
5660c8ff9df648001102f010,21,"but the gun didn't work,"
5660c8ff9df648001102f010,22,so he ran
5660c8ff9df648001102f010,23,but the bear chased him back to the cabin.
647f99680ecd4f7712a8c8f9,1,This is a story about three friends who met back in 1949.
647f99680ecd4f7712a8c8f9,2,They are three big strong men who were athletes in college.
647f99680ecd4f7712a8c8f9,3,"After college, one worked on a farm and the other two worked in the city."
647f99680ecd4f7712a8c8f9,4,"The farm worker, who'd been raised outdoors, wasn't really an outdoors type person."
647f99680ecd4f7712a8c8f9,5,The other two loved the out doors and convinced their friend to go bear hunting with them.
647f99680ecd4f7712a8c8f9,6,"He wasn't that interested in hunting, but allowed himself to be convinced."
647f99680ecd4f7712a8c8f9,7,The three friends took a plane from Fort Worth and travelled to a cabin in the north woods.
647f99680ecd4f7712a8c8f9,8,"The place was so spooky none of them felt like hunting, so they spent the majority of the time playing cards, eating and sleeping."
647f99680ecd4f7712a8c8f9,9,They eventually decided that at least one of them should hunt and kill a bear so as not to face ridicule back home by returning empty-handed.
647f99680ecd4f7712a8c8f9,10,So they cut cards to decide who would go and the farmworker drew the highest card.
647f99680ecd4f7712a8c8f9,11,"He went out, despite having had no desire to go on the hunting trip, and came across a large bear."
647f99680ecd4f7712a8c8f9,12,"He attempted to shoot it, but discovered he's forgotten to load his rifle."
647f99680ecd4f7712a8c8f9,13,The bear then chased him back through the woods and all the while he was shouting to his friends to open the cabin door for him.
647f99680ecd4f7712a8c8f9,14,"As he approached the cabin he turned sharply and, as the door was open, the bear charged inside."
647f99680ecd4f7712a8c8f9,15,He then shut the door behind the bear with his friends inside.
647f99680ecd4f7712a8c8f9,16,"Subsequent to this, he hasn't been asked on any more hunting trips."
60a4d771dee801a5f428e1b6,1,I had met my friends through sports.
60a4d771dee801a5f428e1b6,2,We were all athletes in different schools.
60a4d771dee801a5f428e1b6,3,I was the farm guy and they were from the city.
60a4d771dee801a5f428e1b6,4,Our friendship grew when we started attending the same school we all applied for.
60a4d771dee801a5f428e1b6,5,"They were interested in the farm life, so they would come visit."
60a4d771dee801a5f428e1b6,6,"They helped with chores, daily tasks and explore the environment."
60a4d771dee801a5f428e1b6,7,I was not as enthusiastic because I was already accustomed to the life but I joined in because I was part of the friendship.
60a4d771dee801a5f428e1b6,8,"In all the activities done in the farm, they were mostly interested in hunting."
60a4d771dee801a5f428e1b6,9,The interest grew to the point of them suggesting that we go bear hunting in the woods of Canada.
60a4d771dee801a5f428e1b6,10,I did not like the idea but because we are friends I let them convince me otherwise.
60a4d771dee801a5f428e1b6,11,"So, we booked a flight to go there and stayed in an old creepy cabin."
60a4d771dee801a5f428e1b6,12,"For the first couple of days, we were settling in and playing games."
60a4d771dee801a5f428e1b6,13,"At some point, the idea of bear hunting grew and we started talking about it again."
60a4d771dee801a5f428e1b6,14,There was some indecision about who was going to out and hunt the bear.
60a4d771dee801a5f428e1b6,15,"To solve the problem, we played a game of cards and whomever accumulated the most points will be the one going out."
60a4d771dee801a5f428e1b6,16,"I was the one who did, the person who was not interested in going there in the first place."
60a4d771dee801a5f428e1b6,17,"I went out in the woods, for same time it was very quite with not activity."
60a4d771dee801a5f428e1b6,18,"I heard a sound and as I turned to see where it came from, a huge bear was staring at me."
60a4d771dee801a5f428e1b6,19,I was very scared and the first instinct was to shoot.
60a4d771dee801a5f428e1b6,20,Unfortunately I did not load the gun and in a state of panic I resorted to running.
60a4d771dee801a5f428e1b6,21,"It was in that moment, I realized that I was not much of a fast runner."
60a4d771dee801a5f428e1b6,22,The bear was right behind me.
60a4d771dee801a5f428e1b6,23,"I managed to get to the cabin, and shouted, signaling my friends to open."
60a4d771dee801a5f428e1b6,24,They did just that but the bear came in with me.
60a4d771dee801a5f428e1b6,25,I declared that I had did my part and it was time for them to do theirs.
60a4d771dee801a5f428e1b6,26,"After that experience, they had never talked about bear hunting again."
6634d6cb760f023d8d7b2038,1,A man was talking about his friends
6634d6cb760f023d8d7b2038,2,"that he knew before 1949,"
6634d6cb760f023d8d7b2038,3,they all ended up at the same school together again.
6634d6cb760f023d8d7b2038,4,"He was happy about it,"
6634d6cb760f023d8d7b2038,5,"he also invited them up to his farm,"
6634d6cb760f023d8d7b2038,6,which they spent a lot of time hunting.
6634d6cb760f023d8d7b2038,7,"He didn't enjoy hunting as much as the others,"
6634d6cb760f023d8d7b2038,8,as he has grew up with it.
6634d6cb760f023d8d7b2038,9,"Several years passed,"
6634d6cb760f023d8d7b2038,10,doing the same things.
6634d6cb760f023d8d7b2038,11,one of them decided we should go bear hunting.
6634d6cb760f023d8d7b2038,12,"The man wasn't interested,"
6634d6cb760f023d8d7b2038,13,but he liked being part of the group and agreed.
6634d6cb760f023d8d7b2038,14,"They travelled many miles to the cabin,"
6634d6cb760f023d8d7b2038,15,they stayed there for several days
6634d6cb760f023d8d7b2038,16,but didn't catch a bear to hunt.
6634d6cb760f023d8d7b2038,17,then it was stated that if they don't catch a bear
6634d6cb760f023d8d7b2038,18,"and went home empty handed,"
6634d6cb760f023d8d7b2038,19,they would of took some verbal heat from their friends and family back home.
6634d6cb760f023d8d7b2038,20,"So the man decided to go out on his own,"
6634d6cb760f023d8d7b2038,21,and he spotted a bear.
6634d6cb760f023d8d7b2038,22,HE noticed when he went to shoot that his gun wasn't loaded.
6634d6cb760f023d8d7b2038,23,So he had to run
6634d6cb760f023d8d7b2038,24,He ran very fast back to the cabin
6634d6cb760f023d8d7b2038,25,and they dealt with it.
6634d6cb760f023d8d7b2038,26,they delegated the role of skinning it.
5efa3b73f0ef1585a149d72b,1,This is a story of four guys
5efa3b73f0ef1585a149d72b,2,who met when they were young.
5efa3b73f0ef1585a149d72b,3,As youngsters they were in different schools
5efa3b73f0ef1585a149d72b,4,but competed against each other as athletes.
5efa3b73f0ef1585a149d72b,5,They later ended up being in school together
5efa3b73f0ef1585a149d72b,6,and became friends.
5efa3b73f0ef1585a149d72b,7,The narrator was from a farm
5efa3b73f0ef1585a149d72b,8,and the other three from the city.
5efa3b73f0ef1585a149d72b,9,They all spent a lot of time on the farm helping out
5efa3b73f0ef1585a149d72b,10,as the city guys enjoyed hunting.
5efa3b73f0ef1585a149d72b,11,"The narrator did not enjoy hunting,"
5efa3b73f0ef1585a149d72b,12,but went along with it for the sake of his friends.
5efa3b73f0ef1585a149d72b,13,One day they decided to set off on a trip to Canada bear hunting.
5efa3b73f0ef1585a149d72b,14,They took a plane
5efa3b73f0ef1585a149d72b,15,and then canoed and hiked for many many miles
5efa3b73f0ef1585a149d72b,16,until they reached the cabin in the depth of the woods.
5efa3b73f0ef1585a149d72b,17,Finally realised that they did not want to go out in the night hunting
5efa3b73f0ef1585a149d72b,18,as it was very dark and deserted.
5efa3b73f0ef1585a149d72b,19,They played cards and ate and slept.
5efa3b73f0ef1585a149d72b,20,"However, they realised that they would need to take a bear home"
5efa3b73f0ef1585a149d72b,21,to prove to people that they had been hunting.
5efa3b73f0ef1585a149d72b,22,They drew cards to see who would go out for the bear
5efa3b73f0ef1585a149d72b,23,and the other three would then skin the bear and pack it to take it home.
5efa3b73f0ef1585a149d72b,24,The narrator drew the short straw
5efa3b73f0ef1585a149d72b,25,so took the gun and head into the woods.
5efa3b73f0ef1585a149d72b,26,"He eventually found a bear,"
5efa3b73f0ef1585a149d72b,27,the biggest he had ever seen.
5efa3b73f0ef1585a149d72b,28,he raised his gun to shoot
5efa3b73f0ef1585a149d72b,29,but realised that it was not loaded.
5efa3b73f0ef1585a149d72b,30,he ran for his life back to the cabin
5efa3b73f0ef1585a149d72b,31,with the bear in pursuit.
5efa3b73f0ef1585a149d72b,32,The bear followed him into the cabin.
5efa3b73f0ef1585a149d72b,33,He trapped the bear
5efa3b73f0ef1585a149d72b,34,and shouted to his friends that he had called the bear
5efa3b73f0ef1585a149d72b,35,and it was now their turn.
5efa3b73f0ef1585a149d72b,36,"After that, he was never invited on hunting trips again."
63dbddb434d075a0bff1dbc7,1,4 boys who know each other through sporting activities become friends when they are all at University together.
63dbddb434d075a0bff1dbc7,2,1 of them lives on a farm
63dbddb434d075a0bff1dbc7,3,"and the other 3, who are all city boys, enjoy coming out to the farm and hunting rabbits etc."
63dbddb434d075a0bff1dbc7,4,The 1st man isn't that keen on hunting
63dbddb434d075a0bff1dbc7,5,but he goes along with it as he enjoys being part of the group.
63dbddb434d075a0bff1dbc7,6,A few years pass
63dbddb434d075a0bff1dbc7,7,and they decide they want to hunt a bear.
63dbddb434d075a0bff1dbc7,8,The narrator isn't that keen
63dbddb434d075a0bff1dbc7,9,"but agrees, again, as he is part of the friendship group."
63dbddb434d075a0bff1dbc7,10,"They take a plane to Canada,"
63dbddb434d075a0bff1dbc7,11,kayak up a river
63dbddb434d075a0bff1dbc7,12,and then hike deep into the north woods until they reach a very remote cabin.
63dbddb434d075a0bff1dbc7,13,They unpack
63dbddb434d075a0bff1dbc7,14,and all agree it's a spooky spot
63dbddb434d075a0bff1dbc7,15,and no one is that keen on actually going out and hunting for a bear.
63dbddb434d075a0bff1dbc7,16,After 3 days they say that the peer pressure if they go back without a bear will be unbearable ;)
63dbddb434d075a0bff1dbc7,17,and so they draw straws to decide who will go out into the spooky woods and hunt.
63dbddb434d075a0bff1dbc7,18,"The one who hates hunting, the narrator, pulls the short straw."
63dbddb434d075a0bff1dbc7,19,He goes out
63dbddb434d075a0bff1dbc7,20,"and has no luck, wandering around seeing nothing."
63dbddb434d075a0bff1dbc7,21,Then he hears a sound behind him
63dbddb434d075a0bff1dbc7,22,and there is the biggest bear he has ever seen.
63dbddb434d075a0bff1dbc7,23,he raises his gun
63dbddb434d075a0bff1dbc7,24,and fires
63dbddb434d075a0bff1dbc7,25,but he has forgotten to load the gun.
63dbddb434d075a0bff1dbc7,26,The bear starts to run at him
63dbddb434d075a0bff1dbc7,27,and he turns around and hightails it back to the cabin shouting at his friends to open the door.
63dbddb434d075a0bff1dbc7,28,"At the last minute he swerves to the side,"
63dbddb434d075a0bff1dbc7,29,the bear runs in the cabin
63dbddb434d075a0bff1dbc7,30,and he shuts the door shouting at his friends that they can sort the bear out.
63dbddb434d075a0bff1dbc7,31,His friends never ask him to go hunting again.
