573c6b96b3a71f00146df8c4,15,as they were all spooked out.,leaving them thoroughly unnerved.
573c6b96b3a71f00146df8c4,16,So for a few days they just stayed in the cabin together,"Consequently, they spent several days confined to the lodge"

5a9d223b89de8200013f1893,12,So we sat around playing cards and not being able to sleep.,"Consequently, we spent our time indoors playing card games and struggling to sleep."
5a9d223b89de8200013f1893,13,The others felt we would lose face if we didn't come back with a bear so we drew cards and the person with the high card had to go hunt a bear.,"Concerned about our reputation, we decided that someone must hunt a bear, so we used a card draw to determine who it would be."
5a9d223b89de8200013f1893,14,Wouldn't you know it!,As luck would have it!
5a9d223b89de8200013f1893,15,I got the high card and had to go out with the shotgun.,The draw resulted in me having to venture into the woods armed with a shotgun.

5a9d223b89de8200013f1893,20,"The bear started to run at me so I ran as fast as I could, with the bear on my tail all the way back to the cabin.","The bear charged at me, prompting me to sprint back to the cabin as fast as possible, the bear hot on my heels."
5a9d223b89de8200013f1893,21,"I shouted ""Open the door, open the door!"" and the guys opened the door and as I reached it I turned right and the bear ran in the cabin and I shouted you guys can skin him!","Yelling for the door to be opened, I made a sharp turn upon reaching it, causing the bear to continue straight into the cabin, where I then exclaimed they could take care of the skinning!"

5b119f161e55760001b9daac,11,to go and hunt bears.,with the aim of bear hunting.
5b119f161e55760001b9daac,12,Farm boy didnt want to go,The farm boy was reluctant to join
5b119f161e55760001b9daac,13,as he had no interest,"since it didn't pique his interest,"
5b119f161e55760001b9daac,14,but he did go as not to let the group down.,yet he participated to avoid disappointing the others.
5b119f161e55760001b9daac,15,They stayed in an old cabin in the woods,They lodged in a rustic cabin amidst the forest
5b119f161e55760001b9daac,16,"and all of them were quite unnerved by the general spookiness of the area,","and were all somewhat disturbed by the eerie surroundings,"
5b119f161e55760001b9daac,17,so they didnt go hunting at all.,which led them to abandon their hunting plans.
5b119f161e55760001b9daac,18,"They stayed in and played cards,","Instead, they stayed indoors playing card games,"
5b119f161e55760001b9daac,19,eating and drinking the days away.,whiling away the time with food and drink.

5b119f161e55760001b9daac,22,and find a bear for them to take back with them.,to track down a bear to bring home.

5b119f161e55760001b9daac,24,"so had to go out looking for a bear,","and was thus compelled to search for a bear,"
5b119f161e55760001b9daac,25,even though he hadnt wanted to go on the trip at all in the first place!,despite his initial reluctance to even join the excursion!

5b119f161e55760001b9daac,29,and had actually forgotten to load the gun!,only to realize he had neglected to load the weapon!
5b119f161e55760001b9daac,30,"He started running as the bear chased him down,","He bolted, with the bear in hot pursuit,"
5b119f161e55760001b9daac,31,as fast as he could run to try and get back to the cabin.,racing as swiftly as possible back to the cabin.
5b119f161e55760001b9daac,32,"He shouted out for the other guys to open the door,","He yelled for his companions to unlock the door,"
5b119f161e55760001b9daac,33,and as he got to the door he stepped aside,"and as he neared the entrance, he dodged to the side"
5b119f161e55760001b9daac,34,and the bear ran into the cabin where the guys were.,causing the bear to barrel into the cabin with his friends inside.
5b119f161e55760001b9daac,35,He closed the door on them!,He swiftly shut the door behind them!
5b119f161e55760001b9daac,36,"He said he has not been asked on a hunting trip ever since,","He jokes that he hasn't been invited on a hunting expedition since then,"
5b119f161e55760001b9daac,37,and this was 30+ years ago now.,and that was over three decades ago.

5ba3dde51ce477000117a55e,2,but all went to different schools growing up.,though they each attended separate schools throughout their childhood.
5ba3dde51ce477000117a55e,3,1 grew up on a farm,One was raised on a rural farmstead
5ba3dde51ce477000117a55e,4,and 3 lived in the city.,while the other three resided in an urban environment.
5ba3dde51ce477000117a55e,5,"The 3 from the city used to like to go to the other friend's farm to hunt squirrels and rabbits,","The trio from the urban area often enjoyed visiting the rural friend's farm to pursue squirrels and rabbits,"
5ba3dde51ce477000117a55e,6,but the friend from the farm didn't care much for hunting.,"however, the farm-dwelling friend was not fond of the hunting activity."
5ba3dde51ce477000117a55e,7,The 3 friends from the city suggested going hiking in the mountains to hunt bears.,The urban trio proposed a mountain hiking trip to track and hunt bears.
5ba3dde51ce477000117a55e,8,The friend from the farm did not want to go,The rural friend was reluctant to join the expedition
5ba3dde51ce477000117a55e,9,but agreed to go anyway to be part of the group.,yet consented to participate to maintain camaraderie with the group.
5ba3dde51ce477000117a55e,10,They travelled by canoe for about a day and a half,They journeyed via canoe for roughly a day and a half
5ba3dde51ce477000117a55e,11,"and then hiked what appeared to be another 500 miles, according to the friend from the farm",followed by what seemed to the farm friend like an additional trek of 500 miles
5ba3dde51ce477000117a55e,12,and stayed in a cabin.,before settling into a woodland cabin.
5ba3dde51ce477000117a55e,13,After 3 or 4 days they had not ventured out to hunt a bear,"Despite spending three to four days at the location, they hadn't ventured out in pursuit of a bear"
5ba3dde51ce477000117a55e,14,as none of them really wanted to.,since none truly harbored the desire to do so.
5ba3dde51ce477000117a55e,15,One of the friends said they needed to go home with a bear,One companion insisted they must return with a bear
5ba3dde51ce477000117a55e,16,as a lot of people knew they were coming to hunt bears,given that many were aware of their bear hunting intentions
5ba3dde51ce477000117a55e,17,"and would give them a hard time about it if they came home empty handed,","and would ridicule them if they returned without a catch,"
5ba3dde51ce477000117a55e,18,so they agreed to get a bear.,leading them to collectively decide to procure a bear.
5ba3dde51ce477000117a55e,19,They cut cards to decide which of them would go and get the bear,They resorted to drawing cards to determine who would undertake the task of capturing the bear
5ba3dde51ce477000117a55e,20,and the remaining 3 friends would skin it.,while the other three would be responsible for its skinning.
5ba3dde51ce477000117a55e,21,"The friend from the farm, who did not even want to go hunting, drew the card","Ironically, the farm friend, who was initially averse to the hunt, selected the card"
5ba3dde51ce477000117a55e,22,which meant he had to go and get the bear.,signifying that he was the one tasked with the bear's capture.
5ba3dde51ce477000117a55e,23,"He found a bear, the biggest he'd ever seen,","He encountered a bear, larger than any he had seen before,"
5ba3dde51ce477000117a55e,24,and went to shoot it with his gun,and attempted to shoot it with his firearm
5ba3dde51ce477000117a55e,25,"but had forgotten to load it,","only to realize he had neglected to load it,"
5ba3dde51ce477000117a55e,26,so started running away from the bear.,prompting him to flee from the pursuing bear.
5ba3dde51ce477000117a55e,27,"The bear chased him back to the cabin,","The bear followed him all the way back to the cabin,"
5ba3dde51ce477000117a55e,28,and they ended up trapping the bear inside the cabin.,resulting in the bear being confined within the structure.
5ba3dde51ce477000117a55e,29,The friend who went to get the bear told the others to get on with their part of the deal,The bear-chased friend instructed his companions to fulfill their part of the agreement
5ba3dde51ce477000117a55e,30,and he would go and get another one.,while he ventured out to capture another bear.
5ba3dde51ce477000117a55e,31,The friends from the city never invited the friend from the farm hunting again.,"Subsequently, the urban friends never again extended a hunting invitation to their farm-raised companion."
5bc879d3836d560001fc421a,1,A boy met three other boys slightly before they all attended college together in 1949.,A young man encountered three peers just before they commenced their college journey together in 1949.

5bc879d3836d560001fc421a,3,The other three grew up in the city.,"His three companions, in contrast, were urban dwellers from birth."
5bc879d3836d560001fc421a,4,For this reason the city boys were quite keen on the idea of hunting.,"Consequently, the urbanites harbored a strong fascination with the pursuit of game."
5bc879d3836d560001fc421a,5,The farm boy was not so thrilled as this was quite normal to his general way of life.,"Conversely, the rural youth found little excitement in hunting, as it was a routine part of his daily existence."
5bc879d3836d560001fc421a,6,They would hunt together on his property.,Their hunting expeditions would take place on his family's land.
5bc879d3836d560001fc421a,7,Even though the boy wasn't keen he did it to fit in with the group.,"Despite his lack of enthusiasm, he participated to assimilate with his new friends."
5bc879d3836d560001fc421a,8,One day they all decided to take a trip to northern Canada to try to hunt a bear.,"On one occasion, they collectively resolved to venture to the northern reaches of Canada in quest of a bear."
5bc879d3836d560001fc421a,9,The boy was still not keen but was pressured to go with his group.,"Reluctantly, the farm-raised boy yielded to the collective will of his companions."
5bc879d3836d560001fc421a,10,They flew out of Fort Wayne and headed to northern Canada together.,"Departing from Fort Wayne, they embarked on their joint expedition to the Canadian north."
5bc879d3836d560001fc421a,11,They went to some woods where they had rented a spooky looking cabin.,They settled into a foreboding cabin they had leased within a dense forest.
5bc879d3836d560001fc421a,12,For days the boys could not bring themselves to go and look for the bear as they were scared by their surrounding.,"For several days, trepidation prevented the young men from venturing out in search of the bear."
5bc879d3836d560001fc421a,13,So they played cards and drank and slept.,"Instead, they occupied themselves with card games, libations, and rest."
5bc879d3836d560001fc421a,14,Before they were due to come home they were worried that people would make fun of them if they came back and had not brought a bear.,"As their return loomed, anxiety mounted over the potential ridicule for not having captured a bear."
5bc879d3836d560001fc421a,15,So they drew cards and the boy telling the story unfortunately drew the short straw (so to speak).,"In response, they resorted to a card draw, and fate dictated that the storyteller select the losing card."
5bc879d3836d560001fc421a,16,He went out into the woods and found a bear.,He ventured into the forest and encountered a bear.
5bc879d3836d560001fc421a,17,The bear chased him all the way back to the cabin.,The bear pursued him relentlessly back to the safety of their cabin.
5bc879d3836d560001fc421a,18,He let the bear into the cabin and said there you go boys there a bear to skin ill go and get another one.,"Upon reaching the cabin, he admitted the bear and proclaimed, 'There's your bear to skin; I'll fetch another,' to his astonished friends."
5bc879d3836d560001fc421a,19,Surprisingly none of his friends ever invited him hunting again.,"Unexpectedly, none of his companions extended another hunting invitation thereafter."
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,1,I knew some acquaintances,I was acquainted with some individuals
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,2,and then when I went to a new school,and upon attending a new educational institution
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,3,they were then also there,it turned out they were present there as well
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,4,and we got to being good friends.,which led to us becoming close companions.
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,5,We were all on the same athletics team.,All of us participated in the same track and field team.
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,6,The other 3 lived in the city,The trio resided in the urban area
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,7,however I was brought up on a farm,while I was raised on rural farmland
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,8,and they liked to come up to the farm to help with chores and hunt.,and they enjoyed visiting the farm to assist with tasks and engage in hunting.
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,9,As we grew up,As time passed
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,10,we were talking one day,we found ourselves in conversation one day
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,11,and someone mentioned about going bear hunting,and the idea of embarking on a bear hunt was proposed
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,12,however I really didn’t want to go.,but I was not keen on the idea.
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,13,I also didn’t want to disappoint the group,I didn't wish to let my friends down
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,14,so I agreed to go even through I didn’t want to.,thus I consented to join despite my reluctance.
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,15,So we took a flight to the canal,"Hence, we embarked on a plane journey to the canal"
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,16,where we then had to use canoes to get to the bottom of the mountain,where we then navigated canoes to reach the mountain's base
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,17,which seemed to take forever.,which appeared to be an endless endeavor.
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,18,Once we got to the mountain,Reaching the base of the mountain
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,19,we then had to walk what felt like 5 days to get to the cabin.,we trekked what seemed an eternity to arrive at the cabin.
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,20,Once we got to the cabin,Upon our arrival at the cabin
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,21,we realised how scary the place was,we were struck by its eerie atmosphere
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,22,so we decided to stay inside and not go out,leading us to resolve to remain indoors and not venture out
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,23,so we stayed in the cabin playing cards.,spending our time indoors playing card games.
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,24,Towards the end of the break,As our vacation neared its conclusion
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,25,we realised if we didn’t take a bear home with us,we realized that returning without a bear would subject us to ridicule
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,26,we would be talked about unkindly,thus we agreed to draw cards
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,27,so we decided that we would cut cards,deciding that the one with the highest card would undertake the bear hunt
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,28,and whoever got the highest would be the one to go get a bear,while the other three would prepare the bear's hide for the journey back.
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,29,and the remaining 3 would be the ones to skin the bear ready to take home.,"Regrettably, I drew the highest card"
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,30,Unluckily it was me who got the highest card,and so I ventured into the ominous forest in search of a bear.
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,31,so I went out in the scary woods looking for a bear.,"Eventually, I encountered the largest bear I had ever seen (even in pictures!)"
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,32,I finally found the biggest bear I had ever seen ( even in a photo!),"I attempted to fire the rifle, but it failed to discharge as it was unloaded."
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,33,I shot the gun but it didn’t go off as it hadn’t been loaded.,"Therefore, I sprinted back to the cabin as fast as I could."
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,34,So I ran and ran back towards the cabin.,With the cabin finally in view
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,35,When the cabin was in sight,I yelled out 'open the door!'
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,36,I shouted “open the door”,As the door swung open
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,37,when the door opened,I darted to the right
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,38,I moved to the left,and the bear charged inside!
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,39,and the bear ran in!,I informed the others that I had fulfilled my part!
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,40,I told the rest id done my bit!,Reflecting on the event now
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,41,Looking back now,we all concur that I indeed did my share!
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,1,This is a story about me and three of my friends.,This tale revolves around myself and three companions.
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,2,We knew each other back in 1949.,We were acquaintances since the year 1949.
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,3,At one point we all attended the same high school.,There was a time when we all went to the same secondary school.
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,4,We were athletes on the school team.,Our common ground was being members of the school's sports team.
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,5,All the guys were the macho type.,Each one of us embodied the stereotypical tough guy.
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,6,They used to love to go hunting.,Their favorite pastime was engaging in hunting.
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,7,Reluctantly I would go with them.,"I would join them, albeit with some hesitation."
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,8,They liked hunting squirrel and other small animals.,Their quarry often included squirrels and various petite creatures.
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,9,I didn't have much interest in hunting.,Hunting never really piqued my interest.
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,10,I grew up on a farm.,My upbringing was on a farmstead.
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,11,I was used to these activities.,Such activities were familiar to me.
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,12,I was no longer excited by them.,The thrill of these pursuits had long since faded for me.

5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,15,Again I wasn't particularly keen to do this.,"Once more, I wasn't overly enthusiastic about the idea."
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,16,I agreed to go anyway.,"Nevertheless, I consented to accompany them."

5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,18,When we landed we had to paddle in canoes for what seemed like two days.,"Upon arrival, we found ourselves paddling canoes for what felt like an eternity."

5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,26,So we just stayed in the cabin.,"Thus, our time was spent solely within the confines of the cabin."
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,27,Towards to the end of our stay one of the guys said we're going to look stupid if we don't come back with a bear.,"As our visit neared its end, one friend remarked that returning without a bear would be embarrassing."

5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,31,Can you believe it?,Would you believe it?

5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,35,Suddenly I looked up and saw a bear.,"Out of nowhere, I glanced up to find a bear."

5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,44,He did not want me on his turf.,"Clearly, it did not appreciate my intrusion."
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,45,So I turned and ran like hell.,"With no other option, I bolted as fast as I could."
5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,46,I saw the cabin up ahead.,The sight of the cabin was a welcome one.

60250e892b5c5727eeeef076,2,Three were from the city and one was from a farm background.,"Among them, three hailed from urban areas, while one had a rural upbringing."
60250e892b5c5727eeeef076,3,All of them were of strong build and liked to help out on the farm and hunt squirrels and other small creatures.,"Each was robustly built, with a fondness for assisting on the farm and pursuing small game like squirrels."
60250e892b5c5727eeeef076,4,In 1949 they planned a bear hunt despite the boy from the farming background being indifferent to the trip.,"In the year 1949, they arranged to go bear hunting, even though the individual with farm roots was apathetic about the journey."
60250e892b5c5727eeeef076,5,They flew up from Fort Worth into Canada with a view to canoeing up to the Great North Woods.,"Departing from Fort Worth, they headed to Canada, intending to paddle their way to the Great North Woods by canoe."
60250e892b5c5727eeeef076,6,They canoed some great distance and then backpacked up to a cabin that they had rented.,"After canoeing a considerable distance, they hiked to a lodge they had leased."
60250e892b5c5727eeeef076,7,The bulk of the time they played cards and did not go out at night.,"Mostly, they spent their time playing card games and stayed indoors at night."
60250e892b5c5727eeeef076,8,They felt that they had to have some thing to bring back and drew cards to decide who would go out and get the bear.,"Feeling the need to return with a trophy, they drew lots to determine who would venture out to hunt the bear."
60250e892b5c5727eeeef076,9,The farm boy went out but had not loaded his rifle.,"The country-raised boy set out, yet his rifle remained unloaded."
60250e892b5c5727eeeef076,10,He found a bear that chased him all the way back to the cabin.,He encountered a bear that pursued him right to the doorstep of their lodge.
60250e892b5c5727eeeef076,11,He yelled to them to open the cabin door and the bear rushed into the cabin.,"Shouting for his friends to unlock the door, he led the bear straight into their dwelling."
60250e892b5c5727eeeef076,12,He announced that he had delivered the bear and joked that he was going back for another one.,"Proclaiming that he had brought the bear, he humorously suggested he was off to fetch another."
60250e892b5c5727eeeef076,13,Years later they laughed but he remarked that he was never asked to go on another bear hunt.,"In later years, they would chuckle over the incident, but he noted that he was never again invited to join a bear hunting trip."
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,1,This is a story about some college friends.,The tale revolves around a group of university pals.
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,2,I got acquainted with some guys in college.,"During my college years, I became friends with a few fellows."
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,3,These guys loved to hunt... rabbits and deers and things.,"These fellows had a passion for hunting... various game like rabbits, deer, and the like."
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,4,"I am not the hunting type, but I usually went with them and entertained those ideas.","Hunting wasn't really my thing, yet I often joined them and humored the notion."
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,5,"Eventually, they started talking about hunting a bear, and finally convinced me to go with them.","In time, they began to discuss the prospect of bear hunting and eventually persuaded me to accompany them."
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,6,"I was totally talked into going, even though I did not want to.","Despite my reluctance, I was completely swayed to participate."
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,7,"Well, we travelled up north canada into some woods to hunt bears.","So, we set off to the northern Canadian wilderness for a bear hunting expedition."
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,8,"The group of us canoed up into the woods as far as we could go, and then backpacked the ret of the way... what felt like 500 miles... to a cabin that they rented.","Our group paddled deep into the forest until we couldn't anymore, then hiked what seemed an eternity, about 500 miles, to a cabin they had leased."
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,9,"It was a really spooky place, and when we were there no one felt like actually going out and hunting.","The cabin was quite eerie, and upon arrival, nobody really felt up to the task of hunting."
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,10,"We ended up sleeping, eating and playing cards for three or four days.","Our days were spent lounging, feasting, and engaging in card games for about three or four days."
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,11,"On the fourth or fifth day, one guy piped up and said that we better not go home empty handed when everyone knew that we were coming to hunt some bears.","On the fourth or fifth day, one of the guys spoke up, insisting we couldn't return empty-handed, especially since everyone knew we were out to hunt bears."
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,12,If we went home empty handed we would never hear the end of it.,Returning without a bear would mean endless teasing and ridicule.
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,13,"So we all decided that we would draw cards, and whoever got the highest would go out and hunt the bear, and the others would skin it and cut it into chunks to take home.","Thus, we agreed to a card draw, with the highest card determining who would hunt the bear, while the rest would prepare the catch for the journey back."
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,14,Guess who drew the highest card... the guy who DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO BE THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE.,"Ironically, the highest card was drawn by the one person who least desired to be there."
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,15,But I had agreed to play the game.,"Nevertheless, I had consented to the rules of the game."
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,16,So I took the gun and went out.,"So, armed with a rifle, I set out into the wilderness."
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,17,It felt like I had walked for hours and hours in those woods and found nothing.,I trekked for what seemed like an eternity in the forest without a trace of wildlife.
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,18,"Eventually, I heard a noice behind me, I turned and saw the biggest bear I had ever seen.","Finally, a rustling sound caught my attention; turning around, I was faced with the largest bear I'd ever encountered."
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,19,I had never even seen a bear that big in a PICTURE.,"I couldn't recall ever seeing such a colossal bear, not even in photographs."
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,20,And that old bear was not happy that I was in his territory.,"Clearly, this massive bear was displeased with my intrusion into his domain."
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,21,"The only thing I could do was turn around and run run run, but that old bear was fast.","My only option was to pivot and make a dash for it, yet the bear was alarmingly swift."
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,22,He was right on my tail.,He was hot on my heels in no time.
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,23,"When the cabin was in sight I started yelling ""Open the door, open the door"", with the bear hot on my tail.","As the cabin came into view, I began to scream, 'Get the door open, get the door open!' with the bear breathing down my neck."
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,24,"The guys opened the door, but before going in I quickly turned to the left, but the bear went straight inside.","My friends flung the door open, and in that critical moment, I veered to the right, while the bear charged straight into the cabin."
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,25,I closed the door and shouted THERE YOU HAVE YOUR BEAR.,"I slammed the door shut and exclaimed, 'THERE'S YOUR BEAR!'"
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,26,"This story was thirty years ago, and who wouldve guessed that I have never been invited to go hunting with them again.","That escapade was thirty years ago, and who would have thought, I've never again been asked to join a hunting trip."
604b2da4f24a3d7a227553a0,1,I had some friends from college in 1949.,"Back in 1949, I had a group of friends from my college days."
604b2da4f24a3d7a227553a0,2,We became acquainted through sport.,Our friendship formed around our mutual interest in sports.
604b2da4f24a3d7a227553a0,3,We went to different schools but through sport became friends.,"Although we attended different high schools, our shared passion for sports led to our friendship."
604b2da4f24a3d7a227553a0,4,"When we finished school, we somehow applied to the same college and became reacquainted.","Post-graduation, it was by chance that we all enrolled in the same college and reconnected."
604b2da4f24a3d7a227553a0,5,The other three boys were from the city while I was a farm boy.,"The other three lads hailed from an urban background, whereas I grew up on a farm."
604b2da4f24a3d7a227553a0,6,"Even though I didn't like hunting, we used to go hunting together, hunting animals like squirrels.","Despite my aversion to hunting, I would join them on hunting trips for small game like squirrels."
604b2da4f24a3d7a227553a0,7,"One time, the boys decided to go hunt a bear in Canada.","On one occasion, the group made plans to pursue a bear hunt in Canada."
604b2da4f24a3d7a227553a0,8,I didn't like the idea but had to go along because my friends wanted to go hunting.,"Reluctantly, I agreed to accompany them on the bear hunt, yielding to their enthusiasm."
604b2da4f24a3d7a227553a0,9,We left Fort Wayne and went further north into the northern forests of Canada.,"Departing from Fort Wayne, we ventured deep into Canada's northern woodlands."
604b2da4f24a3d7a227553a0,10,We reached a lake and took canoes out until we couldn't go further.,"Arriving at a lake, we paddled our canoes until we could no longer proceed."
604b2da4f24a3d7a227553a0,11,We then hiked for 500 miles until we reached our cabin.,"From there, we trekked 500 miles to our designated cabin."
604b2da4f24a3d7a227553a0,12,"We didn't want to hunt a bear, so we stayed in the cabin for four or five days, playing cards.","Preferring not to chase bears, we spent four or five days indoors, amusing ourselves with card games."
604b2da4f24a3d7a227553a0,13,"After four or five days, one of the boys said we need to hunt a bear or the people we told back home would laugh at us.","However, after several days, one companion insisted we go bear hunting to avoid ridicule from folks back home."
604b2da4f24a3d7a227553a0,14,So we decided whoever pulled the highest card would have to hunt the bear.,We agreed that the person drawing the highest card would be tasked with the bear hunt.
604b2da4f24a3d7a227553a0,15,Guess who got picked?,Can you imagine who was chosen?
604b2da4f24a3d7a227553a0,16,"The guy who didn't even want to go hunting, me!","Ironically, it was me, the one who was least enthusiastic about hunting!"
604b2da4f24a3d7a227553a0,17,I walked for bit until I found a huge bear.,I roamed for a while until I encountered an enormous bear.
604b2da4f24a3d7a227553a0,18,I didn't even see one so big in pictures.,The bear's size was beyond anything I had seen in photographs.
604b2da4f24a3d7a227553a0,19,I took the shot and missed.,I attempted a shot and missed.
604b2da4f24a3d7a227553a0,20,The bear chased me and I ran as fast as I could.,"The bear gave chase, and I sprinted with all my might."
604b2da4f24a3d7a227553a0,21,"When I was close to the cabin, I shouted, ""OPEN THE DOOR! OPEN THE DOOR!"" and quickly turned sharply left.","Approaching the cabin, I yelled frantically, ""OPEN THE DOOR! OPEN THE DOOR!"" before veering sharply to the left."
604b2da4f24a3d7a227553a0,22,"The bear ran straight through the door into the cabin, and I said, ""There, I brought you a bear.""","The bear continued straight and barged into the cabin, whereupon I remarked, ""There, I've delivered you a bear."""
604b2da4f24a3d7a227553a0,23,It's no wonder the guys don't take me hunting since this event.,"Ever since that incident, it's no surprise that the guys have excluded me from hunting trips."
604b2da4f24a3d7a227553a0,24,This happened 30 years ago.,That adventure unfolded three decades ago.
60618b3bff746e7fbfc84910,1,I built a relationship with three buddies I was acquainted with.,I developed a bond with three pals I knew.
60618b3bff746e7fbfc84910,2,"After graduation, we met again in college.",We reunited at college post-graduation.
60618b3bff746e7fbfc84910,3,That is when the friendship started.,It was then that our friendship truly began.
60618b3bff746e7fbfc84910,4,This was back in 1949.,This occurred in the year 1949.
60618b3bff746e7fbfc84910,5,One day they suggested that we go hunting.,"One occasion, they proposed we should try hunting."
60618b3bff746e7fbfc84910,6,But I was not keen on taking part in that activity.,"Yet, I had little interest in engaging in such an endeavor."
60618b3bff746e7fbfc84910,7,"However, I let them talk me into it.","Nonetheless, they persuaded me to join them."
60618b3bff746e7fbfc84910,8,We made sure that we rented out a cabin.,We ensured to lease a cabin for the occasion.
60618b3bff746e7fbfc84910,9,We ensured that we had enough groceries.,We stocked up on ample provisions.
60618b3bff746e7fbfc84910,10,The people who suggested that we go hunting chickened out.,The very ones who recommended the hunting trip got cold feet.
60618b3bff746e7fbfc84910,11,That meant we were stuck in the cabin for four days without doing anything.,"This resulted in us being holed up in the cabin for four days, idle."
60618b3bff746e7fbfc84910,12,The idea of going home without a bear or nothing to show that we at least attempted to hunt did not sit well with one of my friends.,"The thought of returning home empty-handed, without even an attempt at hunting, was unacceptable to one of my companions."
60618b3bff746e7fbfc84910,13,So they decided to bet on who would go out to kill the bear.,"Thus, they wagered on who would venture out to slay the bear."
60618b3bff746e7fbfc84910,14,Can you guess who the bear fell on?,Would you believe who it ended up being?
60618b3bff746e7fbfc84910,15,"Me, the person who initially did not want to go hunting.","Myself, the one who was originally against the hunting trip."
60618b3bff746e7fbfc84910,16,I then took the gun and went hunting for the bear for hours.,"So, I grabbed the rifle and set out to hunt the bear for several hours."
60618b3bff746e7fbfc84910,17,"Suddenly, I heard something behind me.","Out of nowhere, I detected a noise behind me."
60618b3bff746e7fbfc84910,18,"When I turned around, I saw a large bear staring at me.","Turning around, I was met with the sight of a massive bear."
60618b3bff746e7fbfc84910,19,"In as much as I was scared, I thought BINGO!","Despite my fear, I thought to myself, 'JACKPOT!'"
60618b3bff746e7fbfc84910,20,Finally a bear I can finally take to my friends.,"At last, a bear to present to my companions."
60618b3bff746e7fbfc84910,21,I then attempted to open fire.,I made an attempt to shoot.
60618b3bff746e7fbfc84910,22,But the gun would not go off.,"However, the rifle failed to fire."
60618b3bff746e7fbfc84910,23,I then realized that the gun was not loaded.,I soon discovered that the rifle was unloaded.
60618b3bff746e7fbfc84910,24,The only thing I could do is run for my life because bears are terrifying.,My only option was to flee because bears are indeed fearsome.
60618b3bff746e7fbfc84910,25,Finally saw the cabin we rented.,"At last, I glimpsed the cabin we had rented."
60618b3bff746e7fbfc84910,26,"I started shouting, ""open the door"" to my friends.",I began yelling for my friends to 'open the door!'
60618b3bff746e7fbfc84910,27,I went into the cabin.,I entered the cabin.
60618b3bff746e7fbfc84910,28,I made sure to shut the cabin door shut!,I was careful to slam the cabin door closed!
60618b3bff746e7fbfc84910,29,My friends could not believe it.,My friends were in utter disbelief.
60618b3bff746e7fbfc84910,30,They've never suggested that I go hunting with them ever again.,They have never again proposed that I accompany them on a hunt.
606c7b742c448e3ca901220c,1,A man had three friends in college in 1949.,"In 1949, a man was friends with three individuals during college."

606c7b742c448e3ca901220c,5,The man was a farm boy,The man grew up on a farm
606c7b742c448e3ca901220c,6,"and his friends were all from the city,","while his companions were urban dwellers,"
606c7b742c448e3ca901220c,7,so they came to his family's farm to hunt and help out with chores.,which led them to visit his family's farm for hunting and to assist with farm work.
606c7b742c448e3ca901220c,8,"One day, they decided to go hunt a bear,","On a particular day, they resolved to pursue a bear,"
606c7b742c448e3ca901220c,9,and the man joined them even though he didn't really want to.,"and although he was reluctant, the man accompanied them."
606c7b742c448e3ca901220c,10,"They took a plane up to Canada,","They flew to Canada for the hunt,"
606c7b742c448e3ca901220c,11,"and then took their canoes on a big lake,","then continued their journey by canoeing across a vast lake,"
606c7b742c448e3ca901220c,12,"travelled that way for a few days,","navigating the waters for several days,"
606c7b742c448e3ca901220c,13,and then backpacked another 500 miles or so until they reached the cabin they had rented.,followed by a trek of roughly 500 miles to the cabin they had leased.
606c7b742c448e3ca901220c,14,"The area around the cabin was a spooky wood,","The cabin was surrounded by an eerie forest,"
606c7b742c448e3ca901220c,15,so they were afraid to go out into the woods.,which made them hesitant to venture into the woods.
606c7b742c448e3ca901220c,16,"Eventually, they decided that,","Ultimately, they concluded that"
606c7b742c448e3ca901220c,17,"since everyone was expecting them to bring home a bear,","owing to the expectation of returning with a bear,"
606c7b742c448e3ca901220c,18,that they had to actually go out and hunt.,they were compelled to actually embark on the hunt.
606c7b742c448e3ca901220c,19,They drew cards to determine who was going to go out and get the bear,They used a card draw to decide who would be the one to hunt the bear
606c7b742c448e3ca901220c,20,"(the rest would skin and pack it),","(while the others would handle the skinning and packing),"
606c7b742c448e3ca901220c,21,and it was the narrator who was chosen.,and fate selected the storyteller for the task.
606c7b742c448e3ca901220c,22,He went out with his gun,"Armed with his rifle, he set out"
606c7b742c448e3ca901220c,23,"and found a massive bear,","and encountered an enormous bear,"
606c7b742c448e3ca901220c,24,"but when he went to shoot it,","but as he prepared to shoot,"
606c7b742c448e3ca901220c,25,he found he had forgotten to load his gun.,he realized he had neglected to load his firearm.
606c7b742c448e3ca901220c,26,"The bear chased him back to the cabin,","The bear gave chase, forcing him to retreat to the cabin,"
606c7b742c448e3ca901220c,27,and his friends opened the door for him just in time.,where his companions swiftly let him in just in the nick of time.

6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,3,He was from a farm,Originating from a rural farm
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,4,while the other 3 were from the city.,whereas his three companions hailed from urban areas.
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,5,So The city ones were really fascinated by the outdoors,"Thus, those from the city were quite intrigued by rural life"
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,6,"because they havent really experianced it much before,","since they had seldom experienced it before,"
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,7,but as for our main character from the farm,"whereas the protagonist, the farm dweller"
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,8,he had enough the outdoors.,had his fill of nature.
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,9,But after being apart of the group for so long,"However, after spending a considerable time with the group"
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,10,the 3 city ones wanted to try hunting.,the urban trio became interested in attempting to hunt.
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,11,The farm guy did not like the idea too much,The agricultural fellow wasn't too keen on the idea
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,12,and didnt like it even more when he figured out they wanted to go bear hunting in canada.,and was even less thrilled when he learned they planned to pursue bear hunting in Canada.
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,13,He didnt back out of going though,"He didn't withdraw from the trip, though"
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,14,because he couldnt find a reason to say no.,as he couldn't come up with an excuse to decline.
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,15,So the four of them end up going to Canada to try bear hunting.,"Consequently, the quartet set off for Canada to engage in bear hunting."
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,16,After driving for as long as they could drive to get to their destination,They drove as far as possible to reach their intended spot
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,17,the road ends.,until the road terminated.
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,18,They have to backpack what feels like 500miles to get to the cabin they were going to be staying at.,They were then forced to hike what seemed an endless distance to the lodge they'd be staying in.
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,19,But when everyone gets there its really spooky.,"Upon arrival, everyone found it quite eerie."
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,20,The cabin is old,The lodge was decrepit
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,21,and they are in the middle of no where.,and they were isolated in the wilderness.
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,22,So instead of bear hunting the 4 guys decide to stay in the cabin and play card games for 4 days.,"Rather than pursuing bears, the four friends opted to remain indoors and indulge in card games for four days."
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,23,They did not go outside at nighttime,They refrained from venturing out after dark
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,24,and hunkered down in the cabin.,and stayed fortified within the lodge.
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,25,"After 3-4 days though someone says ""people back home are going to real mean to us if we don't come back with a bear, because they all know that were going bear hunting out in the forest"".","However, after three to four days, someone remarked, ""If we return without a bear, folks back home will ridicule us, given they're aware we went bear hunting in the woods""."
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,26,So the group of friends decide that they need to get a bear.,"Thus, the comrades concluded they must procure a bear."
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,27,But because none of them want to they play a card game for it.,"Reluctant to do so, they decided the matter with a card game."
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,28,The loser would have to get the bear,The one who lost would have to capture the bear
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,29,and the winners would have to skin butcher and bag the bear meat.,"while the victors would be tasked with skinning, butchering, and packaging the bear's meat."
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,30,Our main character the one that didnt even want to be there in the first place loses,"Ironically, the main character, who was least enthusiastic about the trip, lost"
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,31,and has to go hunt a bear.,and was obligated to pursue the bear.
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,32,So he sets out to find a bear in the forest.,He ventured into the woods in search of a bear.
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,33,He spends hours out there looking for this bear,He dedicated hours to the hunt without success
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,34,but cant find anything.,and failed to locate any bears.
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,35,Eventually he turns around,Turning back
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,36,and sees a huge bear directly behind him.,he encountered an enormous bear right behind him.
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,37,A bear bigger than any bear he has ever seen before even in pictures.,"It was a bear of unprecedented size, surpassing any he'd seen, even in photographs."
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,38,"So he immediately tries to shoot the bear,","He attempted to shoot the bear on impulse,"
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,39,but he forgot to load his gun.,only to realize he hadn't loaded his firearm.
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,40,So in panic the only thing he can do is run.,"In a state of panic, his only option was to flee."
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,41,He starts running as fast as he could.,He sprinted with all his might.
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,42,He recalls being a fast runner in the past,He remembered being swift in his younger days
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,43,but the old bear is still gaining on him.,yet the aged bear was quickly closing in.
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,44,As he is getting closer to the cabin where everyone else is,Approaching the cabin where his friends were
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,45,"he yells ""OPEN THE DOOR, OPEN DOOR"".","he shouted, ""UNLOCK THE DOOR, OPEN IT!"""
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,46,The other guys open the door for him,His friends complied and opened the door
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,47,and he rushes inside,allowing him to bolt inside
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,48,and close the door behind him,and secure the door behind him
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,49,locking the bear out,effectively barring the bear's entry
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,50,"and says, ""Well I brought you guys the bear, you better get to skinning"".","and proclaimed, ""I've delivered the bear to you, now get to work on the skinning""."
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,51,After 30 years the 3 guys still say he completed his task of bringing a bear back.,"Three decades later, the three friends still acknowledge that he fulfilled his duty of returning with a bear."
6084e285eda36ec8617451f1,52,But for some reason they never invited him to go hunting again.,"Yet, for an unknown reason, they never again asked him to join a hunting expedition."
60a4d771dee801a5f428e1b6,1,I had met my friends through sports.,My acquaintance with my friends began through our mutual involvement in sports.
60a4d771dee801a5f428e1b6,2,We were all athletes in different schools.,Each of us was an athlete representing different educational institutions.
60a4d771dee801a5f428e1b6,3,I was the farm guy and they were from the city.,"While I hailed from a rural background, they were urban dwellers."
60a4d771dee801a5f428e1b6,4,Our friendship grew when we started attending the same school we all applied for.,"Our bond strengthened upon enrolling in the same institution, which we had all chosen."
60a4d771dee801a5f428e1b6,5,"They were interested in the farm life, so they would come visit.","Curious about rural life, they would often make trips to the farm."
60a4d771dee801a5f428e1b6,6,"They helped with chores, daily tasks and explore the environment.","During their visits, they assisted with various farm duties and explored the surroundings."
60a4d771dee801a5f428e1b6,7,I was not as enthusiastic because I was already accustomed to the life but I joined in because I was part of the friendship.,"My enthusiasm was less, being familiar with farm life, yet I participated out of camaraderie."
60a4d771dee801a5f428e1b6,8,"In all the activities done in the farm, they were mostly interested in hunting.","Among the farm activities, their fascination lay predominantly with the sport of hunting."
60a4d771dee801a5f428e1b6,9,The interest grew to the point of them suggesting that we go bear hunting in the woods of Canada.,Their interest escalated to proposing a bear hunting adventure in the Canadian forests.
60a4d771dee801a5f428e1b6,10,I did not like the idea but because we are friends I let them convince me otherwise.,"Despite my reservations, our friendship led me to eventually agree to the idea."
60a4d771dee801a5f428e1b6,11,"So, we booked a flight to go there and stayed in an old creepy cabin.","Consequently, we arranged air travel and lodged in a rustic, eerie cabin."
60a4d771dee801a5f428e1b6,12,"For the first couple of days, we were settling in and playing games.",The initial days were spent acclimating and engaging in recreational activities.
60a4d771dee801a5f428e1b6,13,"At some point, the idea of bear hunting grew and we started talking about it again.","Eventually, the conversation circled back to the topic of bear hunting."
60a4d771dee801a5f428e1b6,14,There was some indecision about who was going to out and hunt the bear.,Uncertainty arose regarding who would undertake the bear hunt.
60a4d771dee801a5f428e1b6,15,"To solve the problem, we played a game of cards and whomever accumulated the most points will be the one going out.","We decided to play a card game, with the highest scorer designated as the hunter."
60a4d771dee801a5f428e1b6,16,"I was the one who did, the person who was not interested in going there in the first place.","Ironically, I, the reluctant one, ended up scoring the highest."
60a4d771dee801a5f428e1b6,17,"I went out in the woods, for same time it was very quite with not activity.","Venturing into the forest, I experienced a prolonged silence devoid of any signs of life."
60a4d771dee801a5f428e1b6,18,"I heard a sound and as I turned to see where it came from, a huge bear was staring at me.","Upon investigating a noise, I was confronted by the gaze of an enormous bear."
60a4d771dee801a5f428e1b6,19,I was very scared and the first instinct was to shoot.,"Fear took over, and my immediate reaction was to attempt to fire my weapon."
60a4d771dee801a5f428e1b6,20,Unfortunately I did not load the gun and in a state of panic I resorted to running.,"Regrettably, I had not prepared the gun, and in my panic, I chose to flee."
60a4d771dee801a5f428e1b6,21,"It was in that moment, I realized that I was not much of a fast runner.",It was then that I came to the stark realization of my lack of speed.
60a4d771dee801a5f428e1b6,22,The bear was right behind me.,The bear pursued me closely.
60a4d771dee801a5f428e1b6,23,"I managed to get to the cabin, and shouted, signaling my friends to open.",I reached the cabin and yelled for my friends to let me in.
60a4d771dee801a5f428e1b6,24,They did just that but the bear came in with me.,"They opened the door, but the bear followed me inside."
60a4d771dee801a5f428e1b6,25,I declared that I had did my part and it was time for them to do theirs.,I proclaimed that I had fulfilled my role and now it was their turn.
60a4d771dee801a5f428e1b6,26,"After that experience, they had never talked about bear hunting again.","Following that ordeal, they never again broached the subject of bear hunting."
60ab9e649e9587f020d43ede,1,4 friends who met in school decided to go bear hunting.,Four companions who became acquainted during their school years opted to embark on a bear hunting expedition.
60ab9e649e9587f020d43ede,2,3 of the friends were into hunting,Three of the group were enthusiasts of the hunt
60ab9e649e9587f020d43ede,3,but the other friend who worked on a farm was not so keen on the idea,while the one who toiled on a farm was less enthusiastic about the concept
60ab9e649e9587f020d43ede,4,but the other friends encouraged him to come,yet his comrades persuaded him to join
60ab9e649e9587f020d43ede,5,and he eventually gave in.,leading to his eventual acquiescence.
60ab9e649e9587f020d43ede,6,When they got to the destination of the cabin they would be staying for the next 4 nights,Upon arriving at the cabin where they planned to lodge for the ensuing four nights
60ab9e649e9587f020d43ede,7,they realised how spooky the woods were,they were struck by the eerie nature of the surrounding forest
60ab9e649e9587f020d43ede,8,and all decided they was no longer keen on the idea of bear hunting,prompting a unanimous loss of interest in pursuing bears
60ab9e649e9587f020d43ede,9,so for three days then stayed in the cabin playing card games.,"which resulted in them spending three days indoors, engaged in card games."
60ab9e649e9587f020d43ede,10,Then on the last day they decided they would need to go bear hunting,"However, on the final day, they felt compelled to undertake the bear hunt"
60ab9e649e9587f020d43ede,11,as they had told so many people,owing to the numerous tales they had shared
60ab9e649e9587f020d43ede,12,and if they came back empty handed they wouldn't hear the end of it.,fearing the relentless teasing they'd face if they returned without a trophy.
60ab9e649e9587f020d43ede,13,They decided to cut the pack of cards,They agreed to shuffle the deck of cards
60ab9e649e9587f020d43ede,14,and whoever got the highest number would go a bring a bear back from them to skin and show the people back at home.,deciding that the one who drew the card with the highest value would be tasked with retrieving a bear for them to process and display back home.
60ab9e649e9587f020d43ede,15,The friend who didn't want to go in the first place picked the highest card,"Ironically, the reluctant friend drew the winning card"
60ab9e649e9587f020d43ede,16,and went out looking for the bear with the gun.,"and set out to search for a bear, armed with a rifle."
60ab9e649e9587f020d43ede,17,He was walking round and couldn't find anything,He roamed without spotting a single bear
60ab9e649e9587f020d43ede,18,but then he heard a noise,until a sudden sound caught his attention
60ab9e649e9587f020d43ede,19,and turned round and saw a big old bear the biggest he had ever seen.,"and he spun around to confront an enormous bear, larger than any he had previously encountered."
60ab9e649e9587f020d43ede,20,The friend tried to shot the bear,The friend attempted to fire at the bear
60ab9e649e9587f020d43ede,21,but he realised he hadn't loaded the gun,only to realize the rifle was unloaded
60ab9e649e9587f020d43ede,22,so he ran back to the cabin as fast as he could,which sent him sprinting back to the safety of the cabin
60ab9e649e9587f020d43ede,23,and the bear followed him.,with the bear in hot pursuit.
60ab9e649e9587f020d43ede,24,When he got closer to the cabin he yelled for his friends to open up,"Approaching the cabin, he shouted for his friends to let him in"
60ab9e649e9587f020d43ede,25,and they did,which they promptly did
60ab9e649e9587f020d43ede,26,and he ran in just as the bear ran in,allowing him to dash inside just as the bear made its entrance
60ab9e649e9587f020d43ede,27,and he told the friends that he had brought the bear,whereupon he announced that he had indeed brought back a bear
60ab9e649e9587f020d43ede,28,and that they could skin him.,suggesting it was time to skin their catch.
60ab9e649e9587f020d43ede,29,He never got invited hunting with them again.,"Subsequently, he was never again asked to join a hunting trip."
60abcd6f3e5efd9fca235828,1,I started college with my three friends in 1949.,My journey through college began alongside my three childhood friends in the year 1949.
60abcd6f3e5efd9fca235828,2,We were buddies from when I was little.,"Since my early years, we had formed a close-knit group."

60abcd6f3e5efd9fca235828,7,When we were in college they suggested that we go bear hunting.,"During our college days, they proposed we try our hands at bear hunting."
60abcd6f3e5efd9fca235828,8,I was not keen at all to go but I did.,"Despite my reluctance, I ended up joining them."
60abcd6f3e5efd9fca235828,9,We packed up our stuff and took a plane to Canada up north and landed on a lake.,"We gathered our gear and flew north to Canada, touching down on a remote lake."
60abcd6f3e5efd9fca235828,10,When we got to our cabin we did not want to leave and go outside because this place was very spooky.,"Upon arrival at our cabin, the eerie surroundings made us hesitant to venture outside."
60abcd6f3e5efd9fca235828,11,We never left the cabin until one of them said that one of us has to go out and shoot a bear because lots of people know that we went bear hunting and it would be embarrassing to go back without a bear.,It wasn't until one of them pointed out the embarrassment of returning empty-handed from a bear hunt that we considered leaving the safety of our cabin.
60abcd6f3e5efd9fca235828,12,So we had to draw straws and guess who got the short straw? me.,"Ultimately, we resorted to drawing straws, and fate had me select the shortest one."
60abcd6f3e5efd9fca235828,13,The person who does not like to hunt and did not want even come on this trip.,"Ironically, it was I, the non-hunter who had been reluctant to join, who had to face the task."
60abcd6f3e5efd9fca235828,14,So off I went into the forest and came across the biggest bear that I have ever seen.,"Venturing into the woods, I encountered a bear of unprecedented size."
60abcd6f3e5efd9fca235828,15,This bear was so big that I have not even seen pictures of a bear so big.,"The bear's enormity was beyond anything I'd ever seen, even in photographs."
60abcd6f3e5efd9fca235828,16,I pointed my gun and fired but nothing happened because I forgot to load my gun.,"I aimed my rifle and pulled the trigger, only to realize I had forgotten to load it."
60abcd6f3e5efd9fca235828,17,The bear heard me and I started to run.,"Alerted by the click, the bear turned its attention to me, prompting me to flee."
60abcd6f3e5efd9fca235828,18,I ran to the cabin and the bear gave chase.,"I sprinted back towards the safety of our cabin, with the bear in hot pursuit."
60abcd6f3e5efd9fca235828,19,I got to the cabin and banged on the door.,"Reaching the cabin, I pounded frantically on the door."
60abcd6f3e5efd9fca235828,20,The door opened and the bear came sliding in to the cabin.,"As the door swung open, the bear slid right into the cabin behind me."

60b7e1bcfe148de04d17624b,7,All they could do was play cards and stay indoors.,Their only option was to engage in card games and remain sheltered inside.
60b7e1bcfe148de04d17624b,8,Until one of them said that they told everyone that they went bear hunting.,Until someone remarked that they had proclaimed to all their bear hunting adventures.
60b7e1bcfe148de04d17624b,9,It looked somewhat like they go home hunting.,It appeared as though they were more into domestic hunting.

60b7e1bcfe148de04d17624b,19,So he ran back to the cabin as fast as he could.,"Hence, he dashed towards the safety of the cabin with utmost speed."
60b7e1bcfe148de04d17624b,20,The bear was running very fast.,The bear gave chase with remarkable velocity.
60b7e1bcfe148de04d17624b,21,"He thought he used to be fast, but this time.","He once considered himself swift, but not in this instance."

615033332cea99204ba90a95,16,if we didn't bring a bear back.,should we fail to return with a bear.
615033332cea99204ba90a95,17,We split a deck of cards,We divided a pack of playing cards
615033332cea99204ba90a95,18,to see who was going to go get a bear,to determine who would hunt the bear
615033332cea99204ba90a95,19,and then the others would skin it,while the rest would handle the skinning
615033332cea99204ba90a95,20,and cut it down.,and the butchering.
615033332cea99204ba90a95,21,I drew the highest card,The highest card fell to me
615033332cea99204ba90a95,22,and went out looking for a bear.,prompting me to search for a bear.

615033332cea99204ba90a95,24,and it started chasing me.,which then gave chase to me.
615033332cea99204ba90a95,25,It chased me all the way to the cabin,The pursuit led me back to the lodge
615033332cea99204ba90a95,26,and I started shouting to open the cabin door.,as I yelled for them to unlock the door.
615033332cea99204ba90a95,27,When I reached the cabin,Upon reaching the lodge
615033332cea99204ba90a95,28,I went left,I dodged to the left
615033332cea99204ba90a95,29,and the bear ran straight in.,while the bear continued straight inside.
615033332cea99204ba90a95,30,I slammed the door shut,I quickly secured the door
615033332cea99204ba90a95,31,and shouted for them to skin the bear.,and yelled at them to process the bear.
615033332cea99204ba90a95,32,Everyone agreed I had held my end of the deal,It was unanimously accepted that I fulfilled my part
615033332cea99204ba90a95,33,but I never got invited on another hunting trip.,yet I was never asked to join another hunting expedition.
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,1,I met my friends at College in 1949,"In 1949, I encountered my companions at the university"
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,2,but we knew each other before then.,though our acquaintance predates that time.
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,3,"There's 4 of us,","We were a group of four,"
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,4,some from school,including some from my earlier school days
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,5,and some acquaintances,along with a few familiar faces
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,6,but since graduation have all remained friends.,yet we've maintained our friendship post-graduation.
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,7,Being the lads that we are,As the group of guys we were
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,8,we all liked to hunt,hunting was a shared interest of ours
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,9,and would go dear and rabbit hunting and the like.,"engaging in pursuits of deer, rabbits, and similar game."
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,10,I grew up on a farm,Having been raised on a farmstead
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,11,and it didn't appeal to me,the activity didn't quite captivate me
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,12,but I'd go along with it for my friends.,"still, I participated to keep company with my mates."
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,13,"One day, as we were deciding to meet up,","On a particular occasion when planning a get-together,"
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,14,they all decided that it would be fun to go bear hunting,the consensus was that bear hunting would be an exciting venture
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,15,and find a cabin in Canada.,coupled with locating a lodge in Canada.
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,16,The travel was hard going,The journey proved to be arduous
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,17,to when we eventually got there,and upon our arrival
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,18,we decided to not bother finding any bears,we opted to forgo the bear chase
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,19,and just hang out in the cabin.,preferring to simply relax in the lodge.
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,20,Then one of them got the idea that if we went back home not having hunted a bear we'd be skunked.,Then someone voiced concern that returning home without a bear would mean defeat.
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,21,None of us wanted to go out,Reluctant to venture out
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,22,so we decided that we would draw cards,we agreed to let a card draw decide
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,23,and whoever got the worse deal would go out,with the least favorable hand obliging its holder to hunt
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,24,whilst the others stayed back,while the rest would remain indoors
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,25,and who did it end up being?,and guess who was chosen?

6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,27,Then I came across one,"Eventually, I encountered one"
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,28,and I ran back towards the cabin as fast as I could.,and bolted back to the lodge with all my might.
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,29,I was sure I was a better runner than that,I prided myself on my speed
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,30,but that bear was gaining up on me.,yet the bear was quickly closing the distance.
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,31,As soon as I saw the cabin I called out to open the door,"Catching sight of the lodge, I yelled for the door to be opened"
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,32,"and as soon as I reached it,","and upon my arrival,"
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,33,I got in and turned left pulling the door to me,"I dashed in, veered left, yanking the door shut"
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,34,"and shouted 'There, I got the bear, you can skin it'.","exclaiming, 'Done, I've brought the bear, now you handle the skinning'."
6237846b5bea67dd2f13f301,35,They have never let me forget it since,That incident has become an enduring memory among us

63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,3,I knew them before joining graduate school.,Our acquaintance predates our graduate studies.
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,4,We knew each other as we took part in sporting events.,Our paths crossed frequently during athletic competitions.
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,5,"When we joined Graduate school,","Upon enrolling in Graduate school,"
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,6,we found out we were all in the same school,it became apparent we were all attendees of the same institution
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,7,and got to know each other better.,which allowed us to deepen our acquaintance.
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,8,I grew up in a farm and from a village,My upbringing was on a farm in a small village
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,9,while the other three were from the city.,contrasting with my three friends who hailed from urban areas.
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,10,We used to go hunting while we were free,"During our leisure time, we often engaged in hunting"
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,11,and they used to come to my farm and hunt rabbits and squirrels.,where they would visit my farm to pursue rabbits and squirrels.
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,12,"I was not very interested as it was not new for me,","For me, the excitement was lessened as it was a familiar activity,"
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,13,but they really enjoyed it.,yet they found great pleasure in it.
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,14,Once they mentioned they were all done with rabbit hunting,There came a time when they declared they had enough of rabbit hunting
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,15,and we should go bear hunting.,and suggested we should attempt bear hunting instead.
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,16,"I was not hepped up about it,","The idea didn't thrill me much,"
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,17,but since I was part of the group I let them talk me into it.,"but as a member of the group, I was persuaded to join."
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,18,So we flew out of the airport from Fort Wayne,"Thus, we departed from Fort Wayne's airport"
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,19,into some part of Canada,heading towards a certain region in Canada
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,20,and landed on a lake.,where our plane touched down on a lake.
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,21,"From there, we went hiking for about 500 miles into the north woods.","Subsequently, we embarked on a 500-mile hike into the northern forests."
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,22,We had to reach a cabin where we would stay.,Our objective was to find a cabin to serve as our base.
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,23,We reached the cabin,Upon arrival at the cabin
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,24,and it was a spooky place.,we found it to be quite eerie.
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,25,We did not go bear hunting,Bear hunting was not on our agenda after all
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,26,and all for three days was play cards and drink.,as we spent three days playing cards and indulging in drinks.
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,27,After 3 days one of the friends said we need to go bear hunting,"On the third day, one companion insisted we should pursue bear hunting"
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,28,as many people from our place knew we had gone to hunt a bear,since our hometown was aware of our bear hunting expedition
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,29,and if we returned empty handed it would not be good for us.,and returning without a bear would tarnish our reputation.
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,30,so we need to get a bear,"Hence, we needed to procure a bear"
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,31,and either hunt it or take one back to our place.,by either hunting one or bringing one back home.
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,32,I was not interested to go.,My enthusiasm for the hunt was lacking.
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,33,It was decided to play a game of cards,A card game was proposed
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,34,and whoever had the highest number at the end of the game would go to hunt the bear,with the rule that the highest card score would determine the bear hunter
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,35,and the other three will stay and do the skinning and cutting the meat so it can be taken back with us.,while the rest would handle the skinning and preparation of the meat for transport.
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,36,So the card game started,The card game commenced
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,37,and guess who had the highest card!,and the one with the least interest in hunting won the highest card.
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,38,the one who was least interested in hunting the bear.,"Indeed, it was I who drew the highest card."
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,39,"Yes, then I picked up a gun","Subsequently, I armed myself with a rifle"
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,40,and left to hunt the bear on my own.,and ventured out alone in search of the bear.
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,41,"I kept walking but there was nothing to be found,","I wandered without sighting anything,"
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,42,"after quite a while, I heard a noise,",until a distinct sound caught my attention.
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,43,when I went to check I saw the biggest old bear I had ever seen in my life.,"Investigating the noise, I encountered the largest bear I'd ever seen."
63c18acd2386cab09eb432ca,44,It did not look happy to see me in its territory.,The bear seemed displeased with my intrusion.

66634d3d893aa52a324be299,19,We then canoed as far as we could go.,"Next, we paddled our canoe to the furthest point possible."
66634d3d893aa52a324be299,20,"When we got to land, we had to walk 500 miles it seemed like.","Reaching shore, it felt as though we trekked 500 miles."
66634d3d893aa52a324be299,21,"When we got to the cabin, the forest was spooky.","Arriving at the cabin, the woods emitted an eerie vibe."
66634d3d893aa52a324be299,22,None of the guys wanted to venture outside.,None of my companions were eager to explore outside.
66634d3d893aa52a324be299,23,We stayed there for three or four days.,We spent three or four days confined indoors.
66634d3d893aa52a324be299,24,We played cards.,Our time was passed playing card games.
66634d3d893aa52a324be299,25,We ate.,We consumed food.
66634d3d893aa52a324be299,26,We slept.,We rested.
66634d3d893aa52a324be299,27,One of the guys mentioned that we needed to bring a bear back since a lot of people knew we were coming to hunt bears.,"One colleague pointed out our obligation to return with a bear, given the public's awareness of our bear hunting expedition."
66634d3d893aa52a324be299,28,Now no one was looking to be the guy that went out in the spooky woods trying to hunt a bear.,"However, nobody was keen on braving the ominous forest to pursue a bear."
66634d3d893aa52a324be299,29,So me being the farmer went out into the woods.,"Thus, as the agriculturist, I ventured into the woods."
66634d3d893aa52a324be299,30,The others were going to skin the bear and prep it to take back with us.,The rest were tasked with the bear's skinning and preparations for our return journey.
66634d3d893aa52a324be299,31,"When I went outside, I saw the biggest bear anyone’s ever seen.","Stepping outside, I encountered the largest bear ever witnessed."
66634d3d893aa52a324be299,32,I turned around and started back towards the cabin.,"I immediately reversed direction, heading back to the shelter."
66634d3d893aa52a324be299,33,I thought I was fast.,I fancied myself as swift.
66634d3d893aa52a324be299,34,The bear was gaining.,"Nevertheless, the bear was closing in."
66634d3d893aa52a324be299,35,"As I got close to the cabin I started yelling OPEN THE DOOR, OPEN THE DOOR.","Approaching the cabin, I began to scream, 'UNLOCK THE DOOR, UNLOCK THE DOOR!'"
66634d3d893aa52a324be299,36,"When the guys opened the door, I took a quick left.","As my friends flung open the door, I veered sharply to the left."
66634d3d893aa52a324be299,37,I quickly shut the door behind the bear.,"I managed to slam the door shut, trapping the bear inside."
66634d3d893aa52a324be299,38,"I shouted out, SKIN THE BEAR, I’LL GO FIND US ANOTHER ONE.","I yelled, 'DRESS THE BEAR, I'LL SEEK OUT ANOTHER FOR US.'"
66634d3d893aa52a324be299,39,Now this was 30 years ago.,This event took place three decades ago.
66634d3d893aa52a324be299,40,Can you imagine that not one of the guys asked me to go hunting with them since then?,"Would you believe that since that day, none of them have invited me to hunt again?"
666861d3a592871c05b6fa7f,1,Someone lived on a farm,An individual resided on a farmstead
666861d3a592871c05b6fa7f,2,and went hunting there,and engaged in hunting on that land
666861d3a592871c05b6fa7f,3,with their three friends,accompanied by their trio of companions
666861d3a592871c05b6fa7f,4,who they met during school.,whom they had encountered in their school days.
666861d3a592871c05b6fa7f,5,"Their friends convinced them to go on a hunting trip,","These friends persuaded the individual to embark on a hunt,"
666861d3a592871c05b6fa7f,6,"even though they did not want to,","despite their initial reluctance,"
666861d3a592871c05b6fa7f,7,"and they ended up getting attacked,","which resulted in them being assaulted,"
666861d3a592871c05b6fa7f,8,but coming out of it alive.,yet they survived the ordeal unscathed.
666aee2c8bf4c2b358481ce9,1,"1929, 4 students, athletic students all decide to go to a cabin in the woods to hunt some bears.","In 1929, four athletic students collectively decided to retreat to a forest cabin for a bear hunting adventure."
666aee2c8bf4c2b358481ce9,2,I'm not very keen but I go anyway.,"Reluctantly, I joined them despite my reservations."
666aee2c8bf4c2b358481ce9,3,When they get there the cabin is spooky so none of them want to hunt bears.,"Upon arrival, the eerie cabin dissuaded everyone from pursuing the bear hunt."
666aee2c8bf4c2b358481ce9,4,"In the end they decide that they have to bring a bear home as everyone at home is expecting a bear,","Ultimately, they resolved to return with a bear, given the anticipation of their peers back home."
666aee2c8bf4c2b358481ce9,5,so they all draw cards to find out who should do it.,"Hence, they resorted to drawing lots to determine the hunter."
666aee2c8bf4c2b358481ce9,6,"It ended up being me, who didnt even want to be there.","Fatefully, it was I who was chosen, despite my lack of enthusiasm for the trip."
666aee2c8bf4c2b358481ce9,7,So off I went to hunt a bear -,"Thus, I embarked on the bear hunt -"
666aee2c8bf4c2b358481ce9,8,the agreement was that I would hunt the bear and the others would skin and prepare the meat.,under the condition that I would procure the bear while the rest would handle the skinning and meat preparation.
666aee2c8bf4c2b358481ce9,9,"I went out to find a bear but couldnt find any for a very long time,","I scoured the area for a bear but to no avail for an extended period,"
666aee2c8bf4c2b358481ce9,10,"then suddenly, there was one GIANT bear right behind me.","when out of nowhere, an enormous bear appeared right behind me."
666aee2c8bf4c2b358481ce9,11,I lifted the shotgun and tried to fire it at the bear but I had forgotten to load it.,"I aimed the shotgun at the bear, only to realize I had neglected to load it."
666aee2c8bf4c2b358481ce9,12,So I turned around and ran back to the cabin as fast as I could with the bear following close behind me.,"I spun around and sprinted towards the cabin, the bear hot on my heels."
666aee2c8bf4c2b358481ce9,13,"When I got to the cabin I yelled OPEN THE DOOR,","Reaching the cabin, I bellowed for them to UNLOCK THE DOOR,"
666aee2c8bf4c2b358481ce9,14,"which they did,","which they promptly did,"
666aee2c8bf4c2b358481ce9,15,but then the bear ran past me and into the cabin.,only for the bear to charge past me into the cabin.
666aee2c8bf4c2b358481ce9,16,"I took the opportunity to shut the door, trapping the bear inside,","Seizing the moment, I slammed the door shut, confining the bear inside,"
666aee2c8bf4c2b358481ce9,17,"and then I yelled: NOW GET TO SKINNING, I'M OFF TO GET ANOTHER ONE.","and then I proclaimed: START SKINNING, WHILE I GO FOR ANOTHER."
666aee2c8bf4c2b358481ce9,18,My friends all agreed that I had held up my end of the bargain.,My companions concurred that I had fulfilled my part of the deal.
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,1,"In 1949 I had 3 friends in college,","Back in 1949, during my college days, I had a trio of friends,"
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,2,we met in school as we were all athletes,"all of us connected through our involvement in athletics at school,"
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,3,and then we all enrolled in the same school.,which led to our enrollment at the same institution.
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,4,I was from a farm,"My background was rooted in farm life,"
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,5,and they were all from the city.,while each of them hailed from urban environments.
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,6,They used to love to come down to the farm,"They often relished visits to my family's farm,"
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,7,and hunt,"to engage in hunting expeditions,"
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,8,and help me with chores.,and to assist with the various farm duties.
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,9,I wasn't into hunting all that much,"Hunting wasn't exactly my cup of tea,"
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,10,but I would join in to be a part of the group.,yet I participated to maintain camaraderie with my peers.
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,11,"One day they decided they wanted to hunt bear in Canada,","On one occasion, they proposed a bear hunting trip in Canada,"
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,12,I didn't want to do this,"a prospect I found unappealing,"
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,13,but I was a part of the group.,but I was an integral member of our circle.
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,14,So we went deep into Canada,"Thus, we ventured deep into the Canadian wilderness,"
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,15,and had to trek another 500 miles to get to the cabin.,embarking on an additional 500-mile journey to reach our cabin.
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,16,"This place was spooky,","The location had an eerie atmosphere,"
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,17,"we didn't want to hunt the bear once we got there,","and upon arrival, the idea of hunting bears lost its appeal to us,"
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,18,so for about 3 or 4 days we just sat around the cabin playing cards and stuff.,resulting in several days spent idly playing cards and similar activities at the cabin.
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,19,We said we had to hunt the bear though,"Nonetheless, we felt compelled to pursue the bear,"
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,20,as the people at home would give us a hard time if we didn't come home with a bear,"fearing ridicule from our hometown if we returned without one,"
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,21,as many people knew we went out hunting for a bear.,especially since our bear hunting expedition was common knowledge.
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,22,So we agreed that whoever got a high card would have to go out and find the bear.,"We decided to draw cards, agreeing that the highest card would determine who would seek out the bear."
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,23,Of course it was me who had to go and hunt the bear,"Fate had it that I was the one chosen to pursue the bear,"
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,24,while the fellas would skin and pack the bear.,while my companions would handle the skinning and packing of the animal.
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,25,"For hours I was searching in the forest for the bear,","I spent countless hours scouring the woods for the creature,"
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,26,then I heard a noise,"when suddenly a sound caught my attention,"
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,27,and it was behind me.,emanating from right behind me.
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,28,"The biggest bear I have ever seen,","There stood a bear of unprecedented size,"
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,29,not even the pictures had them this big.,surpassing any depiction I had seen in photographs.
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,30,So I pointed my gun at him,"I aimed my firearm at the massive beast,"
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,31,and pulled the trigger.,and squeezed the trigger.
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,32,"Nothing happened,","To my dismay, the gun failed to fire,"
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,33,I forgot the load this turkey.,as I had neglected to load the weapon.
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,34,"So I ran,","Without hesitation, I bolted,"
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,35,I thought I was fast,"believing myself to be swift,"
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,36,but this bear was gaining on me.,yet the bear was quickly closing the distance.
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,37,When he was on my heels,"With the bear nearly upon me,"
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,38,I could see the cabin,"the cabin came into view,"
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,39,"and I shouted ""open the door!"".",and I yelled for my friends to unlock the door.
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,40,That was 30 years ago,"That incident occurred three decades ago,"
666f1aec64844fbd48cd89b8,41,and those fellas have never asked me to come hunting.,"and since then, those guys have never invited me on another hunting trip."
6671897ccb0249a1474a5656,1,"I met my friends in 1949,","In 1949, I encountered my companions,"
6671897ccb0249a1474a5656,2,before that at school actually.,"actually, it was earlier during our school days."

6671897ccb0249a1474a5656,4,and the other 3 were city boys.,while the other three were urban lads.
6671897ccb0249a1474a5656,5,We were all macho,All of us exhibited a tough demeanor
6671897ccb0249a1474a5656,6,and the other 3 liked coming over to the farm,and my city friends enjoyed visiting the farm
6671897ccb0249a1474a5656,7,and go hunting.,to engage in hunting activities.
6671897ccb0249a1474a5656,8,I didn’t like hunting,Hunting wasn't to my liking
6671897ccb0249a1474a5656,9,but I went with them because I was part of the group.,yet I accompanied them as I was a member of the circle.
6671897ccb0249a1474a5656,10,One of them suggested going north,One proposed a trip up north
6671897ccb0249a1474a5656,11,"and bear hunting,","to pursue bears,"
6671897ccb0249a1474a5656,12,I really didn’t want to,"which I was quite reluctant to do,"
6671897ccb0249a1474a5656,13,but I left them talk me into it.,but they persuaded me to agree.
6671897ccb0249a1474a5656,14,We all went up,"Together, we journeyed northward"
6671897ccb0249a1474a5656,15,and ended up changing our minds because it was spooky up there.,and reconsidered our plans due to the eerie atmosphere.
6671897ccb0249a1474a5656,16,Eventually we decided we couldn’t go home without a bear.,We resolved that we couldn't return home bearless.
6671897ccb0249a1474a5656,17,I got the high card,Drawing the highest card fell to me
6671897ccb0249a1474a5656,18,and had to go bear hunting.,which meant I was tasked with the bear hunt.
6671897ccb0249a1474a5656,19,I found one,I encountered a bear
6671897ccb0249a1474a5656,20,but forgot to load the gun,but realized I hadn't loaded my firearm
6671897ccb0249a1474a5656,21,so I started running,prompting me to flee
6671897ccb0249a1474a5656,22,and it chased me to the cabin!,with the bear in hot pursuit toward the cabin!
6671897ccb0249a1474a5656,23,I shouted ‘OPEN THE DOOR’,I bellowed 'UNLOCK THE DOOR'
6671897ccb0249a1474a5656,24,"and they did,","and they complied,"
6671897ccb0249a1474a5656,25,I ran as fast as I could,I sprinted with all my might

6671897ccb0249a1474a5656,28,and I went left.,while I veered to the left.
6671897ccb0249a1474a5656,29,"I shouted ‘there you go boys, he’s in there, you skin it and I’ll go get another one’","I yelled out 'There you have it, lads, he's yours; do the skinning and I'll fetch another!'"
6671897ccb0249a1474a5656,30,they never asked me to go hunting again.,"After that, they never requested my company for a hunt again."

6676d189dcbd4eca274768b2,6,and we stayed in the cabin for three of four days.,resulting in us spending three to four days inside the cabin.
6676d189dcbd4eca274768b2,7,We wanted to bring something back though,"Still, we were keen to return with a trophy"
6676d189dcbd4eca274768b2,8,so it didn’t look like we skunked out.,to avoid the appearance of a failed expedition.
6676d189dcbd4eca274768b2,9,"Guess who it was that ended up going hunting,","Surprisingly, the person who ultimately went on the hunt"
6676d189dcbd4eca274768b2,10,it was me.,turned out to be myself.

6676d189dcbd4eca274768b2,12,I went out to find one,So I set out in search of one
6676d189dcbd4eca274768b2,13,and saw it.,and there it was.

6676d189dcbd4eca274768b2,19,but the bear did not want me in his territory.,while the bear made it clear he didn't welcome intruders.
6676d189dcbd4eca274768b2,20,He ran also.,He gave chase as well.
6676d189dcbd4eca274768b2,21,"When I got back, I slammed the door","Reaching the cabin, I forcefully shut the door"

667889a03a2f652ce630b4bd,10,For 3-4 days they did not want to go bear hunting as they found the woods spooky and did not go out at night.,"For the initial 3-4 days, they were reluctant to hunt bears, finding the forest eerie and avoiding nocturnal excursions."
667889a03a2f652ce630b4bd,11,One member of the group stated how they could not come back empty handed as they had told many people of their plans so they drew cards and agreed whoever got the high card would hunt the bear and the other three would skin it.,"One group member insisted they couldn't return without a trophy, having boasted of their expedition, so they decided by drawing cards that the one with the highest card would hunt the bear while the others would handle the skinning."
667889a03a2f652ce630b4bd,12,The main character drew the high card and went out to find a bear.,"Fate had the protagonist draw the highest card, sending him on the quest for a bear."

667889a03a2f652ce630b4bd,14,He ran away but the bear was gaining on him.,"Fleeing for his life, he noticed the bear was quickly closing in."
667889a03a2f652ce630b4bd,15,He screamed to his friends to open the cabin door and the bear went into the cabin.,"He yelled for his companions to unlock the cabin door, which led to the bear entering the cabin."
667889a03a2f652ce630b4bd,16,The main character told them that he fulfilled his promise and they have to skin him now.,"He reminded his friends of their agreement, stating it was now their turn to skin the bear as promised."

668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,2,"actually I met them before,","though we actually crossed paths earlier,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,3,"in high school in 1949,","back in high school, around 1949,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,4,"because we were high schools athletes so we were acquainted before college,","since we all participated in high school sports, we knew each other prior to university,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,5,"then we met each other at college,","and it was there that we reconnected,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,6,so we became good friends.,which led to our strong friendship.
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,7,"I grew up in a farm but they were from the city,","I was raised on a farm, while they came from urban areas,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,8,"so us being big macho guys we'd go hunting where I used to live,","and as tough guys, we would often hunt in my old stomping grounds,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,9,"I never really liked it,","hunting wasn't really my thing,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,10,but I wanted to be part of the group so I went a long.,"yet to fit in with the crew, I joined them regardless."
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,11,"We used to go squirrel hunting, rabbet hunting...","Our hunting expeditions included squirrels, rabbits, and the like..."
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,12,"they used to really get a kick out of it,","they seemed to thoroughly enjoy these outings,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,13,but I didn't.,whereas I did not share their enthusiasm.
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,14,One time one of my friends said that we should go bear hunting up in Canada.,"Once, a buddy suggested we try bear hunting in Canada."
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,15,"I really didn't want to go,","I wasn't keen on the idea,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,16,but they talked me into it.,"however, they persuaded me."
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,17,"I didn't really have a reason to not go and I let them talk me into it,","Lacking a solid excuse, I caved to their persuasion,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,18,so we went.,and so the trip was on.
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,19,"We flew to Canada through New Fryer,","Our journey to Canada began with a flight to New Fryer,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,20,"we got there,","upon arrival,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,21,"from there we went with canons up a lake,","we continued by canoe across a lake,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,22,"where we rented an old cabin,","eventually renting a rustic cabin,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,23,"we got there,","once there,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,24,"stored away our groceries,","we unpacked our food supplies,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,25,"and settled down,","and made ourselves at home,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,26,"no one was really in the mood to go out hunting, neither was I.","none of us felt inclined to hunt, myself included."
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,27,"So we played card games, ate.","Thus, we spent our time playing cards and eating."
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,28,We stayed like that for 3 or 4 days.,This routine lasted for three or four days.
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,29,"At day 3, someone said that we have to go hunting,","On the third day, someone insisted we must hunt,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,30,"because so many people know we're here, we can't come back without a bear.",arguing that we couldn't return empty-handed given our reputation.
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,31,"So we made a deal that who ever will get the upper card, in the card games we we're playing will need to go hunt the bear alone,","We agreed that the person drawing the highest card in our card game would hunt the bear solo,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,32,"and the others will skim him, butcher, pack him home.","while the rest would handle the skinning, butchering, and packing for the trip back."
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,33,Guess who got the upper card? me!,Fate would have it that I drew the highest card.
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,34,So I had to go because I agreed to play the game.,"Bound by the rules of the game, I had no choice but to proceed."
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,35,"Here I went to go hunting for a bear,","Off I went on a solitary bear hunt,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,36,"I looked for hours and didn't find anything,","searching for hours without a trace,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,37,"till I heard I noise behind me,","until a sound caught my attention from behind,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,38,"I turn around and there is the biggest bear I ever saw in my  life,","I spun around to face the largest bear I'd ever encountered,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,39,bigger than any bear I ever saw in a photo.,one that dwarfed any bear I'd seen in pictures.
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,40,"I whipped out my gun to shoot the bear,","I quickly drew my firearm, aiming at the bear,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,41,"but nothing happed,","but to my dismay,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,42,I FORGIT TO LOAD MY GUN!!!,I HAD FORGOTTEN TO LOAD THE GUN!!!

668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,44,"I thought I was fast,","believing I could outrun it,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,45,"but the bear was on my heels the whole time,","yet the bear was right on my tail the entire time,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,46,"till I got close to the cabin,","until I neared the safety of the cabin,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,47,"I whipped as loud as I can :""THE BEAR IS HERE!!!""","where I yelled at the top of my lungs, 'THE BEAR IS COMING!!!'"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,48,"they opened the door and I turned to the right,","As they flung the door open, I veered right,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,49,and got into the cabin.,and darted inside to safety.
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,50,"They took the bear and skimmed it and wrapped it and brought it home,","They managed to take down the bear, skin it, package it, and bring it back,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,51,"this happed 30 years ago,","this adventure occurred three decades ago,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,52,"but till this day mu friends don't mention hunting to me,","and to this day, my friends steer clear of any hunting talk with me,"
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,53,they know better.,they've learned their lesson.
668796f32bb0599e8ff9bfef,54,That is my story.,That's the tale I have to tell.
6688000c0fc9f75d8caefc4f,1,It is a story about three friends,This tale revolves around a trio of companions
6688000c0fc9f75d8caefc4f,2,that I met in 1949,whom I encountered back in 1949
6688000c0fc9f75d8caefc4f,3,when I started college.,at the onset of my university journey.
6688000c0fc9f75d8caefc4f,4,"Actually I met them before that,","In truth, our paths crossed even earlier,"
6688000c0fc9f75d8caefc4f,5,we became friends,and it was then that our friendship blossomed
6688000c0fc9f75d8caefc4f,6,after we all... went to school at the same place.,after realizing we were all attending the same institution.
6688000c0fc9f75d8caefc4f,7,Previous to that during high school,"Before this, throughout our high school years"
6688000c0fc9f75d8caefc4f,8,"we'd all been school athletes at different schools,","each of us had been athletes at separate schools,"
6688000c0fc9f75d8caefc4f,9,and so we were acquainted.,which is how we initially became familiar with one another.
6688000c0fc9f75d8caefc4f,10,But then after graduation,"However, following our high school graduation"
6688000c0fc9f75d8caefc4f,11,"after we all enrolled in school,","and our subsequent enrollment in college,"
6688000c0fc9f75d8caefc4f,12,"we found that the four of us were all now attending the same school,","it turned out that all four of us had chosen the same university to attend,"
6688000c0fc9f75d8caefc4f,13,and became quite good friends.,which led to us forming a strong bond of friendship.
6688000c0fc9f75d8caefc4f,14,"I was the kid from the farm,","I hailed from a rural farm background,"
6688000c0fc9f75d8caefc4f,15,the other three guys all lived in the city.,while the other three lads were urban dwellers.
6688000c0fc9f75d8caefc4f,16,"So being big macho men that we all were,","Given our collective bravado,"
6688000c0fc9f75d8caefc4f,17,"they used to come out to the farm and hunt,","they would often visit the farm for hunting expeditions,"
6688000c0fc9f75d8caefc4f,18,"and they'd come out,","making frequent trips out there,"
6688000c0fc9f75d8caefc4f,19,and help me do chores and things like that.,to assist with farm duties and the like.
6688000c0fc9f75d8caefc4f,20,Then we'd go rabbit hunting and squirrel hunting and things of that nature.,"We would engage in hunting rabbits, squirrels, and similar activities."
6688000c0fc9f75d8caefc4f,21,I never really enjoyed hunting.,Hunting was never truly my passion.
6688000c0fc9f75d8caefc4f,22,Uh... being born and raised.,Ah... having been brought up in the countryside.
66880d5992fc91de8ff934bc,1,There were a group of 4 friends,A quartet of companions existed
66880d5992fc91de8ff934bc,2,that become close,who grew to be intimate
66880d5992fc91de8ff934bc,3,and one of them lived in a farm,with one residing on a farmstead
66880d5992fc91de8ff934bc,4,while others lived in the city.,whilst the rest made their homes in the urban landscape.
66880d5992fc91de8ff934bc,5,So the other city friends loved to come hunting in the farm,"Hence, the urbanite pals were fond of visiting for hunts at the farm"
66880d5992fc91de8ff934bc,6,with their friend who lives there.,alongside their rural-dwelling comrade.
66880d5992fc91de8ff934bc,7,And although he hates hunting,Despite his aversion to hunting
66880d5992fc91de8ff934bc,8,he always accompanies his friends while they hunt.,he invariably joined his companions during their hunting excursions.
66880d5992fc91de8ff934bc,9,And years passed,As time went by
66880d5992fc91de8ff934bc,10,then one day they suggested they go Bear hunting in Canada,eventually they proposed a Bear hunting trip in Canada
66880d5992fc91de8ff934bc,11,and even though he hates the idea,and even though he detested the concept
66880d5992fc91de8ff934bc,12,he still allowed his friends to talk him into doing it.,he capitulated to his friends' persuasion to participate.
66880d5992fc91de8ff934bc,13,They travelled and lodged in a spooky old cabin for days,"They journeyed and stayed in a foreboding, ancient lodge for several days"
66880d5992fc91de8ff934bc,14,as they did not feel the need to go bear hunting anymore,since they lost the urge to pursue bears
66880d5992fc91de8ff934bc,15,"and one day while they were playing cards,","and on a day spent playing cards,"
66880d5992fc91de8ff934bc,16,they decided to play a game to choose who will go bear hunting,they concocted a game to determine who would undertake the bear hunt
66880d5992fc91de8ff934bc,17,and deliver the bear to the others to skin and take back to the city.,and return with the bear for the rest to skin and transport back to the metropolis.
66880d5992fc91de8ff934bc,18,Unluckily he was picked,"Fatefully, he was selected"
66880d5992fc91de8ff934bc,19,"and he went out looking for a bear,","and he set off in search of a bear,"
66880d5992fc91de8ff934bc,20,he spotted one big old Bear,"eventually encountering a massive, aged Bear"
66880d5992fc91de8ff934bc,21,and just when he wanted to shoot,and at the moment he aimed to fire
66880d5992fc91de8ff934bc,22,he realised he did not load his gun,he discovered his firearm was unloaded
66880d5992fc91de8ff934bc,23,and so the Bear chased him all the way to the cabin,prompting the Bear to pursue him all the way back to the lodge
66880d5992fc91de8ff934bc,24,and when he was near he screamed to be let in.,"and as he approached, he yelled for entry."
66880d5992fc91de8ff934bc,25,The story ended with them agreeing that he did part of his bargain by bringing the Bear to them,The tale concluded with a consensus that he fulfilled his part of the deal by leading the Bear to them
66880d5992fc91de8ff934bc,26,and they had the choice to skin the bear.,leaving them with the option to skin the bear.
66884e1b52a01d16fe557350,1,A boy met his group of friends in 1949.,"In 1949, a young lad joined his circle of companions."
66884e1b52a01d16fe557350,2,They grew up on a farm.,They had been raised on rural farmland.

66884e1b52a01d16fe557350,4,He was not.,"He, however, did not share this interest."
66884e1b52a01d16fe557350,5,They invited him on a trip to Canada to go hunting bears.,They proposed a journey to Canada for a bear hunting expedition.
66884e1b52a01d16fe557350,6,He reluctantly agreed.,"With some hesitation, he consented."
66884e1b52a01d16fe557350,7,He went with them.,"Accompanying them, he went along."
66884e1b52a01d16fe557350,8,They hired canoes.,They procured canoes for their use.
66884e1b52a01d16fe557350,9,They spent days in an old cabin.,They occupied an ancient cabin for several days.
66884e1b52a01d16fe557350,10,They were scared to hunt for bears.,The thought of bear hunting filled them with trepidation.
66884e1b52a01d16fe557350,11,They did not want to go home empty-handed.,"Yet, they were averse to returning without any trophies."
66884e1b52a01d16fe557350,12,"After a few days, they went out to hunt them.","Eventually, they ventured forth to track the bears."
66884e1b52a01d16fe557350,13,The boy found a bear.,The lad encountered a bear.
66884e1b52a01d16fe557350,14,He tried to shoot it.,He attempted to fire at it.
66884e1b52a01d16fe557350,15,His gun wouldn't fire.,"Unfortunately, his firearm malfunctioned."
66884e1b52a01d16fe557350,16,The bear chased him.,"Subsequently, the bear pursued him."
66884e1b52a01d16fe557350,17,"After this adventure, his friends never invited him to hunt again.","Post this escapade, his companions ceased to extend hunting invitations to him."
668936b212cea5becb2cf810,1,It was a story in the year 1949 about a guy who made friends in school.,"In 1949, there was a tale about a fellow who formed friendships at school."
668936b212cea5becb2cf810,2,These friends all loved hunting but him being someone raised to farm he didn't much love hunting and all.,"While these companions were all avid hunters, he, having been brought up on a farm, did not share their enthusiasm for the sport."
668936b212cea5becb2cf810,3,So after school his friends decided to travel to Canada to go bear hunting.,"Consequently, after their schooling, his companions chose to venture to Canada for a bear hunting expedition."
668936b212cea5becb2cf810,4,"He didn't really like that idea but since he has been part of that group, they talked him into it.","Although he was not fond of the plan, his inclusion in the group led them to persuade him to join."
668936b212cea5becb2cf810,5,"They got to Canada, landed on a lake took canoes and paddled about a day and half and backpacked for about five hundred miles too til they got to their cabin they had rented.","Upon arriving in Canada, they touched down on a lake, canoed for a day and a half, and hiked roughly five hundred miles until reaching the cabin they had leased."
668936b212cea5becb2cf810,6,The place was way spooky that they forgot they had come to hunt bears rather they played cards and this went on for about 3 days where one of them came up with the idea they really had to go hunt a bear because they couldn't go home empty handed.,"The cabin was so eerily quiet that they neglected their initial intent to hunt bears, opting instead to play card games for three days, until one suggested they must hunt a bear to avoid returning home empty-handed."
668936b212cea5becb2cf810,7,A decision was made about the person with the highest number of card going to hunt the bear and the remaining will butcher skin and pack him up.,"They agreed that whoever drew the highest card would go on the bear hunt, while the others would handle the butchering, skinning, and packing of the animal."
668936b212cea5becb2cf810,8,Obviously he was the guy who ended up with the highest number.,"Predictably, he was the one who drew the highest card."
668936b212cea5becb2cf810,9,He took an old turkey gun and set of the woods to hunt.,"Armed with an antiquated turkey shotgun, he ventured into the forest on his quest."
668936b212cea5becb2cf810,10,"He came across a big old looking bear and when he was ready to fire, the gun didn't because he had failed to load it back then.","He encountered a large, aged bear and when he attempted to shoot, he realized the gun wouldn't fire because he hadn't loaded it earlier."
668936b212cea5becb2cf810,11,"He had no other choice than to run, and by doing so the bear chased him all the way to the cabin where he screamed and shouted for them to let him in.","With no alternative, he was forced to flee, with the bear in hot pursuit all the way back to the cabin, where he yelled for his friends to let him inside."
668936b212cea5becb2cf810,12,"Alas he got in and closed the door where he told his friends, there is your bear, you asked for it and i have done my part, now you guys go do your part.","Once safe inside, he declared to his companions, 'There's your bear; I've played my part, now it's your turn to fulfill yours.'"
668936b212cea5becb2cf810,13,All this happened thirty years ago and since then he hasn't been asked by his friends to go hunting again with them.,"This event took place three decades ago, and he has not been invited to join his friends on a hunting trip since."

66a2ba211e0d673905b1db03,4,and became friends.,and forged a friendship.
66a2ba211e0d673905b1db03,5,He was from the farm,"His origins were rural, from a farming background"
66a2ba211e0d673905b1db03,6,while the other three were from the city.,whereas his three companions hailed from urban areas.
66a2ba211e0d673905b1db03,7,"Over the years, they came down to the farm to do some hunting.","Throughout the years, they would visit his farm for hunting trips."

66a2ba211e0d673905b1db03,9,"but to the rest of them, it was a lot of fun.","yet for his friends, it was an exciting activity."
66a2ba211e0d673905b1db03,10,"One day, the three friends brought a suggestion to go bear hunting in Canada.","Eventually, his trio of friends proposed a bear hunting expedition in Canada."
66a2ba211e0d673905b1db03,11,The man did not want to but he let them talk him into it.,"Reluctant at first, he was persuaded by his friends to join."

66a2ba211e0d673905b1db03,14,and then hiked what seemed like 500 miles before arriving at a cabin in the woods that they had rented.,then trekked an exhausting distance to reach a secluded cabin they had booked.
66a2ba211e0d673905b1db03,15,"Upon settling down in the cabin, they all decided that they weren't exactly hyped up about going bear hunting.","Once they settled into the cabin, they realized they weren't too keen on the bear hunt."
66a2ba211e0d673905b1db03,16,"So for the next three or four days, they stayed indoors, played card games, and ate.","Thus, they spent the next few days indoors, engaging in card games and enjoying food."
66a2ba211e0d673905b1db03,17,"On the third or fourth day, one of them brought it up that they had to get a bear so as not to disappoint the people waiting for them back at home.","By the third or fourth day, one suggested they needed to hunt a bear to avoid disappointing their folks back home."

66a2ba211e0d673905b1db03,19,"The person with the highest card had to go hunt the bear,","The one with the highest card would undertake the bear hunt,"
66a2ba211e0d673905b1db03,20,while the others would skin it and prepare it for travel.,as the rest would handle the skinning and packing for the journey home.
66a2ba211e0d673905b1db03,21,"After they drew cards, it turned out it was the man who did not even want to go in the first place that got the highest card.",The card draw resulted in the reluctant man getting the highest card.
66a2ba211e0d673905b1db03,22,He took the old gun and set out.,He grabbed the aged firearm and ventured out.
66a2ba211e0d673905b1db03,23,"After what seemed like hours, he heard a growl behind","After a lengthy period, a growl echoed behind him"
66a2ba211e0d673905b1db03,24,and looked back to see the biggest bear he had ever seen in his life.,"and he turned to see an enormous bear, larger than any he'd seen before."
66a2ba211e0d673905b1db03,25,"He picked up the gun and fired, but nothing happened.","He aimed the gun and pulled the trigger, but to no avail."
66a2ba211e0d673905b1db03,26,Turned out he had forgotten to load the gun.,He had neglected to load the firearm.
66a2ba211e0d673905b1db03,27,"He turned on his heels and started running as fast as he could, with the bear on his heels.","Spinning around, he sprinted as quickly as possible, the bear in hot pursuit."
66a2ba211e0d673905b1db03,28,"When he got in sight of the cabin, he started shouting for them to open the door.","Approaching the cabin, he began to yell for his friends to unlock the door."
66a2ba211e0d673905b1db03,29,"The door opened, but instead of going in, he took a left around the cabin,","As the door swung open, he veered left around the cabin,"
66a2ba211e0d673905b1db03,30,while the bear went straight inside.,and the bear charged straight into the cabin.
66a2ba211e0d673905b1db03,31,He quickly closed the cabin door,He swiftly shut the cabin door behind the bear
66a2ba211e0d673905b1db03,32,"and told his friends that he had brought the bear, it was their turn to skin it.","and informed his companions that he had delivered the bear, now it was their job to skin it."
66a2ba211e0d673905b1db03,33,"Eventually, they agreed that he actually played his part.","In the end, they conceded that he had fulfilled his role."
66a2ba211e0d673905b1db03,34,"Although this happened 30 years ago, they never asked him to go hunting since that day.","Though this event occurred three decades ago, they have since never requested his company on a hunt."
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,1,"I know a story from 1949,","There's a tale I recall from 1949,"
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,2,"when I had three friends in college,","the time when I had a trio of friends at university,"
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,3,"who I had been in the same class as in highschool,","whom I had shared classes with in high school,"
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,4,but grew close too in college when we realised we came from the same school.,but we became closer in university upon discovering our shared alma mater.
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,5,"They were 3 macho men,","These guys were the epitome of masculinity,"
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,6,and we all had been athletes.,and we had all participated in sports.
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,7,"After a few years,","Years later,"
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,8,one of them suggested that we go up to Canada to go squirrel and rabbit hunting.,one proposed a trip to Canada for squirrel and rabbit hunting.
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,9,"I didn't really like hunting,","Hunting wasn't exactly my cup of tea,"
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,10,"but I had done everything with that group,","yet I had participated in all activities with this group,"
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,11,so I left them talk me into it.,thus I let them persuade me to join.
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,12,"One of them eventually suggested we go bear hunting instead,","Eventually, one proposed we switch to bear hunting instead,"
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,13,"so we took a plane up to Fort Wayne,","leading us to fly to Fort Wayne,"
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,14,and hiked for a day and a half up to a cabin.,and trek for a day to reach a remote cabin.
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,15,"The woods were really spooky,","The forest seemed quite eerie,"
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,16,"and all the others suddenly didn't feel like going bear hunting either, like me.","and suddenly, the others also lost their enthusiasm for bear hunting, just like me."
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,17,"So for a few days we waited in the cabin,","Hence, we spent several days in the cabin,"
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,18,"eating, sleeping, playing cards,","consuming food, resting, and playing card games,"
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,19,"until one of us realised that too many people knew we had gone back bear hunting,","until it dawned on one of us that too many were aware of our bear hunting trip,"
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,20,so we needed to head back with a bear.,implying we had to return with a bear in tow.
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,21,"They decided, and I agreed, that they would cut cards to decide which one of us would go out,","They concluded, and I concurred, that we would draw cards to determine who would venture out,"
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,22,"get a bear,","secure a bear,"
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,23,and bring it back for the rest to skin and pack so we can take it home.,and carry it back for the others to process and prepare for our journey home.
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,24,"And WHO WOULD HAVE GUESSED,","AND WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT,"
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,25,but it was the guy who didn't even want to go hunting in the first place.,it turned out to be the one who was least keen on hunting.
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,26,But I had agreed to this process.,But I had consented to this method.
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,27,"So I took our shotgun,","So, I grabbed our shotgun,"
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,28,"went out and walked for hours but didn't find anything,","wandered for hours without a trace of anything,"
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,29,"when suddenly I heard a noise,","when out of the blue I detected a sound,"
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,30,and turned to see the biggest old bear I have ever seen.,and spun around to spot the largest bear I'd ever laid eyes on.
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,31,"I aimed my gun and shot it at it,","I pointed my firearm and fired at it,"
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,32,but then realised I had forgotten to load it!,only to realize I had neglected to load the weapon!
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,33,"But the bear didn't like having me in its territory,","However, the bear was not fond of my presence in its domain,"
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,34,so it came after me.,and it pursued me.
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,35,I turned and ran.,I spun around and bolted.
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,36,"I thought I was pretty fast,","I fancied myself as quite swift,"
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,37,but the old bear was gaining on me.,yet the bear was quickly closing in.
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,38,"I ran as fast as I could back to the cabin,","I sprinted with all my might towards the cabin,"
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,39,"yelling ""OPEN THE DOOR, OPEN THE DOOR"".","shouting ""UNLOCK THE DOOR, UNLOCK THE DOOR""."
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,40,"They opened the door to the cabin,","They swung the cabin door open,"
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,41,"and at the last moment I turned left,","and in the nick of time I veered left,"
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,42,"the bear turned right into the cabin,","while the bear barreled right into the cabin,"
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,43,and I turned and shut the door.,and I swiftly closed the door behind it.
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,44,"I yelled ""OK I FOUND A BEAR NOW YOU GUYS SKIN AND PACK IT, I WILL GO FIND ANOTHER ONE"".","I hollered, ""FINE, I'VE BROUGHT BACK A BEAR, NOW YOU DEAL WITH IT, I'LL SEEK ANOTHER""."
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,45,"The others couldn't deny that I had done what I had been told to do,","The rest couldn't argue that I hadn't fulfilled my task,"
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,46,but they haven't invited me out hunting since...,yet they've not asked me to join a hunt ever since...
66a3b02a9431f9e9149cca2a,1,A man had met his three friends due to their athletic experiences in high school.,The gentleman encountered his trio of companions through their shared athletic pursuits during their secondary education.

66a3b02a9431f9e9149cca2a,4,and because of this the 3 all had a knack for hunting.,which is why the trio possessed a natural talent for the hunt.
66a3b02a9431f9e9149cca2a,5,"In 1949, the group decided to go bear hunting,","In the year 1949, they collectively chose to pursue a bear hunting adventure,"

66a3b02a9431f9e9149cca2a,7,They then travelled to Canada via plane,"Subsequently, they embarked on a journey to Canada by aircraft"
66a3b02a9431f9e9149cca2a,8,"and trekked through the woods to get to a cabin,","and navigated through the forest to reach a secluded lodge,"
66a3b02a9431f9e9149cca2a,9,but the eerie atmosphere caused none of them to actually want to go hunting.,yet the unsettling ambiance deterred them from actually engaging in the hunt.
66a3b02a9431f9e9149cca2a,10,"They thought of the consequences of coming back with no bear,","Contemplating the repercussions of returning empty-handed without a bear,"
66a3b02a9431f9e9149cca2a,11,"which caused them to decide to send one person out there to hunt,","led them to the resolution that only one individual should venture out to hunt,"
66a3b02a9431f9e9149cca2a,12,which happened to be the man.,and that individual turned out to be the countryside man.
66a3b02a9431f9e9149cca2a,13,"He ended up finding a giant old bear,","He stumbled upon an enormous, aged bear during his quest,"

66a3b02a9431f9e9149cca2a,15,"so he had to run back to the cabin with the bear on his tail,","forcing him to sprint back to the safety of the lodge with the bear in pursuit,"
66a3b02a9431f9e9149cca2a,16,thankfully being safe.,"fortunately, he emerged unscathed."
66a3b02a9431f9e9149cca2a,17,30 years later and his 3 friends haven't asked him to go hunting since.,"Three decades on, and his three friends have not requested his company on a hunting trip again."

66a64703e3e5dc31b47f050c,3,but they started college together in 1949.,yet their collegiate journey began together that same year.

66a64703e3e5dc31b47f050c,8,he didn't.,which he did not share.

66a64703e3e5dc31b47f050c,10,the man really didn't want to go,but the man was reluctant to join
66a64703e3e5dc31b47f050c,11,"but he had always been part of the group,","despite being an integral part of their circle,"
66a64703e3e5dc31b47f050c,12,so he went.,he still accompanied them.
66a64703e3e5dc31b47f050c,13,"It took them a long time to get there,","The journey to their destination was lengthy,"
66a64703e3e5dc31b47f050c,14,the man felt like he trekked 500 miles.,and he felt as though he had walked a distance of 500 miles.

66a64703e3e5dc31b47f050c,16,it was very scary,"it appeared quite ominous,"
66a64703e3e5dc31b47f050c,17,and none of them wanted to leave.,prompting all to hesitate about venturing out.
66a64703e3e5dc31b47f050c,18,None of them left at night,"They stayed inside during the nights,"
66a64703e3e5dc31b47f050c,19,and none of them wanted to hunt a bear.,with none eager to pursue the bear.
66a64703e3e5dc31b47f050c,20,One of them said 'we must hunt a bear and take one back as people know we are coming out here'.,"One friend insisted, 'we must return with a bear since everyone expects it from our trip'."
66a64703e3e5dc31b47f050c,21,"So they decided to split cards,","Thus, they resorted to drawing cards,"
66a64703e3e5dc31b47f050c,22,whoever got the highest card had to go out and hunt the bear.,with the highest card determining who would hunt the bear.
66a64703e3e5dc31b47f050c,23,The man who didn't want to go got the highest card,"Fate had it that the reluctant man drew the highest card,"
66a64703e3e5dc31b47f050c,24,so out he went.,compelling him to venture out.
66a64703e3e5dc31b47f050c,25,He eventually found a bear,"He came across a bear eventually,"
66a64703e3e5dc31b47f050c,26,and shot at it,"fired his weapon at it,"
66a64703e3e5dc31b47f050c,27,but nothing happened...,yet to no effect...
66a64703e3e5dc31b47f050c,28,he hadn't loaded the gun.,for he had forgotten to load the firearm.

66a64703e3e5dc31b47f050c,34,and the bear ran in the cabin door.,the bear followed him right through the cabin entrance.
