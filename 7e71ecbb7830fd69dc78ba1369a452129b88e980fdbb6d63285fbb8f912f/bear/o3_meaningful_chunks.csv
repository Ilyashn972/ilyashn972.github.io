"(71, 74)","we've got to find a bear to take back home with us, or we're really going to get a bad time from the rest of the people, 'cause too many people know we'd gone bear hunting, and if we come home skunked with no bear they're really going to give us a bad time.”",We'd be ridiculed if we returned without bear
