"(12, 17)","I was the kid from the farm, the other three guys all lived in the city.

"(18, 23)","Then we'd go rabbit hunting and squirrel hunting and things of that nature. I never really enjoyed hunting. Uh ... being born and raised on the farm I was used to the outdoors, wasn't all that exciting to me. But these guys got a big kick out of it, so I'd go along just to be one of the group.","Although I dislike hunting, I keep joining their rural outings to belong"

"(46, 52)","Then after we ... went as far as we could in the canoes, then we had to backpack for another ... five hundred miles I thought, 'till we got to this cabin that they had rented way up there in the north woods.

That was pretty spooky looking territory, let me tell you.","After a grueling backpack to a lonely cabin, my uneasiness grows in the spooky wilderness"
"(53, 57)","So we got up there, and got set up in the cabin, and ... got our groceries stored and everything.

"(65, 70)","We never ventured outside at night, we stayed right there in the old cabin.

"(71, 76)","we've got to find a bear to take back home with us, or we're really going to get a bad time from the rest of the people, 'cause too many people know we'd gone bear hunting, and if we come home skunked with no bear they're really going to give us a bad time.” Soo ... no one wanted to go out, so we all decided that we'd cut the cards.","To choose the unlucky hunter, we cut cards and leave the verdict to chance"
"(77, 81)","Whoever got the high card ... would go out and get a bear, and the rest of them would skin him butcher him and pack him back down, so we could take him home with us. So you know who YOU KNOW WHO got the high card, the guy that didn't even want to be there in the first place.","Of course I draw high card, so the dreaded task falls to me"
"(82, 88)","But I had agreed to play the game ... So ... I took the old gun, and I go out bear hunting. I didn't like this at all. I'm walking out there in the woods for hours it seems like, and I just wasn't seeing any bears or anything, and finally I heard a noise,","Armed and unhappy, I wander the woods for hours until a sudden noise startles me"
"(89, 95)","and I turned around, and there was the biggest old bear I'd ever seen in my life, I'd never even seen a PICTURE of one THAT big.
