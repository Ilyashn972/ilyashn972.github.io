"(1, 6)","This is a story about three of my friends that I met in 1949 when I started college. Actually I met them before that, we became friends after we all... went to school at the same place.",I met my friends in college and we bonded over shared experiences
"(7, 13)","Previous to that during high school we'd all been high school athletes at different schools, and so we were acquainted. But then after graduation when we all enrolled in school, we found that the four of us were all now attending the same school, and we became quite good friends. I was the kid from the farm, the other three guys all lived in the city.",Our friendship grew as we shared our backgrounds and interests
"(14, 20)","So being big macho men that we all were, they used to like to come out to the farm and hunt, and they'd come out, and help me do chores and things like that. Then we'd go rabbit hunting and squirrel hunting and things of that nature. I never really enjoyed hunting. Uh ... being born and raised on the farm I was used to the outdoors,","We spent time hunting on the farm, though I wasn't keen on it"
"(21, 27)","wasn't all that exciting to me. But these guys got a big kick out of it, so I'd go along just to be one of the group. Things went on, we did this for several years, they were always coming out to the farm, and hunting.","Despite my lack of enthusiasm, I joined in to stay connected"
"(28, 34)","After we'd been acquainted for several years, one of them got the idea they'd like to go bear hunting up in Canada. Now that didn't really appeal to me, but I'd always been one of the group, and I couldn't find any real reason not to go, so I left them talk me into it, wasn't too hepped up on this at all.","A bear hunting trip to Canada was proposed, and I reluctantly agreed"
"(35, 41)","I don't care anything really much about hunting period, let alone bear hunting. Be about my luck the bear would wind up hunting me. But as I said, I left them talk me into it. So we took an airplane out of Fort Wayne, and we flew way up into Canada some place,",We traveled to a remote cabin in Canada for the hunt
"(42, 48)","and we landed on a lake, and then we rented canoes, and paddled for another ... day and a half it seemed to me, 'till we got way up in the north woods. Then after we ... went as far as we could in the canoes, then we had to backpack for another ... five hundred miles I thought, 'till we got to this cabin that they had rented way up there in the north woods.","The journey was long and arduous, leading to a secluded cabin"
"(49, 55)","And after I got there, I was even more apprehensive than I had been even before we started, 'cause I didn't really need any part of that. That was pretty spooky looking territory, let me tell you. So we got up there, and got set up in the cabin, and ... got our groceries stored and everything.",Apprehension grew as we settled into the eerie wilderness
"(56, 62)","And after we got to discussing it those guys weren't any more hot about going out in those woods and looking for a bear than I was. We sat around there for three or four days, played cards, and ate, and slept, and we just couldn't ...","We hesitated to hunt, spending days in the cabin instead"
"(63, 69)","no one was in the mood to go out and hunt bear 'cause that's just a plain old spooky looking place. We never ventured outside at night, we stayed right there in the old cabin. Well after we'd been there for three or four days, we got to talking it over, and somebody said “Hey,","Realizing the need to hunt, we devised a plan to draw cards"
"(70, 76)","if we don't go out and hunt some bear ... we've got to find a bear to take back home with us, or we're really going to get a bad time from the rest of the people, 'cause too many people know we'd gone bear hunting, and if we come home skunked with no bear they're really going to give us a bad time.” Soo ... no one wanted to go out, so we all decided that we'd cut the cards.",The pressure to succeed led us to choose a hunter by chance
"(77, 83)","Whoever got the high card ... would go out and get a bear, and the rest of them would skin him butcher him and pack him back down, so we could take him home with us. So you know who YOU KNOW WHO got the high card, the guy that didn't even want to be there in the first place. But I had agreed to play the game ... So ... I took the old gun,","I was chosen to hunt, despite my reluctance and fear"
"(84, 90)","and I go out bear hunting. I didn't like this at all. I'm walking out there in the woods for hours it seems like, and I just wasn't seeing any bears or anything, and finally I heard a noise, and I turned around, and there was the biggest old bear I'd ever seen in my life,","Facing a massive bear, I realized my gun was unloaded"
"(91, 97)","I'd never even seen a PICTURE of one THAT big. I whipped up the gun, and pulled the trigger, and nothing happened. I'd forgot to LOAD that turkey. Well he had ... he just had no desires to have me in his territory,","The bear charged, and I ran for my life"
"(98, 104)","and he made for me. Well there was nothing for me to do but run, and I turned around, I ran as hard as I could go, and I thought I used to be pretty fast, but that old bear, man he was gaining,",A desperate escape with the bear in pursuit
"(105, 111)","he was just right on my heels ... And when I got within sight of that cabin I started yelling “OPEN THE DOOR, OPEN THE DOOR!” Man I was whipping down there just as hard as I could go, and that old bear right on my tail, and they opened the door, and I got right to the cabin door,","I reached the cabin, tricking the bear inside"
"(112, 118)","I made a quick turn to the left, and that old bear went right on in. I just reached back, and pulled the door shut, and said “THERE HE IS FELLOWS, YOU SKIN HIM, I'LL GO GET ANOTHER ONE!”","I shut the door, leaving the bear for my friends to handle"
"(119, 122)","Now all this happened thirty years ago, and all my buddies agreed ... that I lived up to my commitment. But can you BELIEVE, they haven't asked me to go hunting one time since that day.","Reflecting on the adventure, I was never invited to hunt again"
