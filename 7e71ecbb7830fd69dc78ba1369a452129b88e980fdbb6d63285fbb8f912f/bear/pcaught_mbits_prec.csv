Name: mean, dtype: object","they used to like to come out to the farm and hunt,"

Name: mean, dtype: object",and help me do chores and things like that.
17,18,85,45,"18    2.44
Name: mean, dtype: object",Then we'd go rabbit hunting and squirrel hunting and things of that nature.
18,19,80,61,"19    7.59
Name: mean, dtype: object",I never really enjoyed hunting.

Name: mean, dtype: object","Uh ... being born and raised on the farm I was used to the outdoors,"

Name: mean, dtype: object",wasn't all that exciting to me.

Name: mean, dtype: object","But these guys got a big kick out of it,"
22,23,59,32,"23    1.81
Name: mean, dtype: object",so I'd go along just to be one of the group.

Name: mean, dtype: object","Things went on,"

Name: mean, dtype: object","they were always coming out to the farm,"

Name: mean, dtype: object","After we'd been acquainted for several years,"

Name: mean, dtype: object","Now that didn't really appeal to me,"
30,31,58,13,"31   -0.17
Name: mean, dtype: object","but I'd always been one of the group,"

Name: mean, dtype: object","and I couldn't find any real reason not to go,"
32,33,71,30,"33    0.68

Name: mean, dtype: object",I left them talk me into it.

Name: mean, dtype: object","and we flew way up into Canada some place,"

Name: mean, dtype: object","and we landed on a lake,"

Name: mean, dtype: object","and then we rented canoes,"
43,44,73,12,"44   -1.13
Name: mean, dtype: object","and paddled for another ... day and a half it seemed to me,"

Name: mean, dtype: object",'till we got way up in the north woods.
