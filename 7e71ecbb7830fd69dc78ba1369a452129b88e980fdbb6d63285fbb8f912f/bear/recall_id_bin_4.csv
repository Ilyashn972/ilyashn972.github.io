They went to the same school. The farm boy's friends went to his farm to help him with the farm chores. They loved hunting on the farm. Since he was an outdoor person, he was not that excited about what his friends enjoyed doing at the farm with him. One day they went out bear hunting. All they could do was play cards and stay indoors. Until one of them said that they told everyone that they went bear hunting. It looked somewhat like they go home hunting. So they played until the farm guy got the high. He did not want to go hunting. But he let them talk him into it. Now that he got a high card, he had to live up to it. He took his gun and went hunting. As he walked up into the spooky place, he saw one big old bear that he had never seen before. He fired at it. Nothing happened. He saw he did not load it. So he ran back to the cabin as fast as he could. The bear was running very fast. He thought he used to be fast, but this time. As he was approaching the cabin, he shouted at his friend to open the door. They opened and he got in. The bear got so close. That happened 30 years ago. Since then his friends never asked him to go hunting again."

The story-teller was a farmer and his 3 city friends would come out to the farm to help him, esp hunting (which he didn't like doing). One year they decided to go to Canada to hunt bears (even though the story teller didn't want to, he allowed himself to be persuaded). They took a long journey into the wilderness and at the cabin decided it was too scary out there to hunt, so they chilled for a few days. They realised they'd be mocked if they didn't bring back a bear so drew cards for who would hunt alone. The story-teller got the high card so had to hunt. They found a huge bear but forgot the bullets, so tried to fire then had to run away. It chased him back to the cabin and ended up in the cabin with the friends, so he did keep his side of the deal, that he'd catch it and the others had to process it. They never invited him again but agreed he'd done his part of the deal."
