The main one lived on a farm and the other 3 lived in the city. They all used to go hunting on his farm together, but he didn't really care for hunting. They all decided to go on a bear hunting trip. They travelled for a long time until they got to a cabin they had rented. They stayed there for 3 or 4 days before realising none of them wanted to go hunting. They needed to take a bear home otherwise the other people would give them a bad time. They played a card game to decide who would go and get a bear, and the other 3 would skin the bear and pack it. The main man got the highest card so went to get a bear. He found one and went to shoot but realised he hadn't loaded the gun. He ran whilst the bear chased him back to the cabin. He shouted to be let into the cabin and turned left once he got in, then the bear came in. The rest of the men agreed that he had gotten a bear. This story took place 30 years ago and he hasn't been asked to go hunting since."

They had previously been acquainted as high school athletes, but once they entered school together, they all became friends. The man was a farm boy and his friends were all from the city, so they came to his family's farm to hunt and help out with chores. One day, they decided to go hunt a bear, and the man joined them even though he didn't really want to. They took a plane up to Canada, and then took their canoes on a big lake, travelled that way for a few days, and then backpacked another 500 miles or so until they reached the cabin they had rented. The area around the cabin was a spooky wood, so they were afraid to go out into the woods. Eventually, they decided that, since everyone was expecting them to bring home a bear, that they had to actually go out and hunt. They drew cards to determine who was going to go out and get the bear (the rest would skin and pack it), and it was the narrator who was chosen. He went out with his gun and found a massive bear, but when he went to shoot it, he found he had forgotten to load his gun. The bear chased him back to the cabin, and his friends opened the door for him just in time. It has been 30 years since then, and his friends haven't invited him to go hunting again."

His friends liked to come to the farm and hunt for rabbits. They decided to go on holiday to Canada to try and hunt bears. The narrator didn't like hunting but went on the holiday anyway. They got a plane to Fort Wayne and then had to canoe for a long time to get to the cabin. The cabin was very spooky in the forest and nobody wanted to go hunting anymore. They sorted out all their groceries when they arrived. They stayed in the cabin for 3 to 4 days playing cards, and never ventured out at night. On the last day, they realised that they would have to hunt for a bear because otherwise people back home would tease them. So they decided to play a card game to decide who would go out hunting. The narrator drew the highest card, so he had to go hunting. He took his gun and searched for a long time without seeing a bear. Then he saw the biggest bear he'd ever seen. He'd never seen a bear that big in pictures. He went to shoot the bear but realised his gun didn't have any bullets in it. His only choice was to run away from the bear, but the bear was very fast. He used to be fast at running but now he couldn't run faster than the bear. He got near the cabin and shouted ""Open the door"". His friends opened the door and he managed to get into the house. The bear was killed and all his friends celebrated him. They never went hunting together again."

He lived on a farm and they lived in the city - they used to visit him on the farm and they liked to hunt but he didn't. They had an idea to go on a trip to Canada to hunt bears so they went there. They had to go across a lake to get to the woods and had to walk what felt like five hundred miles to get to their cabin. The walk was scary so it put them off wanting to go hunting for bears as they were all spooked out. So for a few days they just stayed in the cabin together and played cards. Then they realised that if they didn't bring back a bear people wouldn't believe them and would probably make fun of them. So they played the high cards game and who ever picked the highest card had to go and hunt the bear alone and bring it back to the cabin dead. The others would skin the bear and prepare it to take back as a trophy. The story teller got the high card so had to go out and hunt. He went out and took a gun, found a bear bigger than he'd even seen on pictures. He went to shoot it and realised that he hadn't loaded the gun so ran instead. He got back to the cabin just in time and slammed the door. They didn't go bear hunting again."

I lifted the shotgun and tried to fire it at the bear but I had forgotten to load it. So I turned around and ran back to the cabin as fast as I could with the bear following close behind me. When I got to the cabin I yelled OPEN THE DOOR, which they did, but then the bear ran past me and into the cabin.
