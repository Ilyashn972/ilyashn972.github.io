After graduation, we met again in college. That is when the friendship started. This was back in 1949. One day they suggested that we go hunting. But I was not keen on taking part in that activity. However, I let them talk me into it. We made sure that we rented out a cabin. We ensured that we had enough groceries. The people who suggested that we go hunting chickened out. That meant we were stuck in the cabin for four days without doing anything. The idea of going home without a bear or nothing to show that we at least attempted to hunt did not sit well with one of my friends. So they decided to bet on who would go out to kill the bear. Can you guess who the bear fell on? Me, the person who initially did not want to go hunting. I then took the gun and went hunting for the bear for hours. Suddenly, I heard something behind me. When I turned around, I saw a large bear staring at me. In as much as I was scared, I thought BINGO! Finally a bear I can finally take to my friends. I then attempted to open fire. But the gun would not go off. I then realized that the gun was not loaded. The only thing I could do is run for my life because bears are terrifying. Finally saw the cabin we rented. I started shouting, ""open the door"" to my friends. I went into the cabin. I made sure to shut the cabin door shut! My friends could not believe it. They've never suggested that I go hunting with them ever again."

He was hesitant but got talked into going bear hunting up north in Canada. They took a flight, canoed and hiked to get to the cabin they had rented. Whole area was spooky and none of them was as eager to go bear hunting as they had been before the trip. They stayed in the cabin for four days, playing cards and rarely leaving the cabin. However, they thought other people, who they had told what they were about to do, would give them a hard time if they don't return with 'a catch'. They drew cards and farm guy got the highest card - he had to go out and bring the bear back. He forgot to load the gun and bear charged towards him but he made a lucky escape back to the cabin."

One friend was reluctantly persuaded to join in. For a while they used to hunt rabbits and squirrels, but then decided to take a holiday to a cabin in the woods to hunt a bear. Nobody could be bothered to go out in the spooky woods to find a bear for three or four days so they just say around the campfire playing cards and talking. Eventually they decided that they have to find a bear otherwise they'd be given a hard time if they returned empty-handed. The three friends decided to cut the deck, and the person who drew the highest card had to go and find a bear. The friend that didn't really enjoy hunting drew the highest card. Off he went to find a bear, Eventually, he turned around to see the biggest bear of his life standing in front of him. He pulled the trigger of the gun he was carrying, but he'd forgotten to load the turkey. So he ran all the way back to the cabin with the bear chasing him, yelling at his friends as he approached to open the door. At the last minute he dodged the doorway and the bear ran straight into the cabin. He told his friends that they could skin the bear. His friends never invited him hunting again."

The friends would often visit the narrator, who lived on a farm. They'd go hunting during those trips. Many years later, one of them suggested they fly to Canada and hunt down a bear. So, they make the trip, which includes a flight a long hike to their cabin in the woods, but by the time they get there, nobody is really in the mood to hunt bears (especially the narrator, who wasn't interested in hunting, anyway). However, after a few days of just staying in the cabin, they realise that they'd need some kind of evidence that they'd been hunting bears to bring back home, as they'd been bragging to all their other friends and families about it. So, they decide to draw cards in order to determine which one of the group had to go out and hunt the bear, alone; the narrator ends up having to do it. So, he takes his gun and makes his way out into the woods, where he eventually finds an enormous bear. Unfortunately, he had forgotten to load the gun before going out, and ends up running for his life as the bear chases him all the way back to the cabin. He gets his friends to open the door and, if I recall correctly, he seems to instead lure the bear inside while he stays outside, leaving his friends to kill and skin it. It's implied that everyone survived the ordeal."

One lived on a farm and 3 were city boys. During their younger years the city boys spent a lot of time visiting the farm and hunting for rabbits and squirrels. They all enjoyed the outdoor life. Long after they left school the city boys decided it would be a good idea to go to Canada to hunt bear. The farm boy wasn't at all keen, but was persuaded to go. The travelling took a long time by plane, canoe and a 500 mile walk to the north woods. They stayed in a cabin but decided they really didn't want to shoot a bear, so they spent time eating, sleeping and playing cards. However it was decided that one of them should shoot a bear because everyone back home would expect them to come back with a trophy. They drew cards and the farm boy got the highest card and went out with his gun. A very large brown bear rose up in front of him but although he took a shot, his gun wasn't loaded, so he ran back to the hut and yelled at his friend to open the door as he got there, he swerved to the right and the bear ran into the cabin. Funnily enough his friends haven't invited to go shooting with them since!!!"

None of us wanted to go out so we decided that we would draw cards and whoever got the worse deal would go out whilst the others stayed back and who did it end up being? Me, so I went off into the woods to look for a bear. Then I came across one and I ran back towards the cabin as fast as I could.

They had all met before this, they were athletes that became acquainted. After they graduated they ended up at the same school and became good friends. The protagonist lived on a farm, and the friends used to come up to the farm to hunt. The protagonist didn't like hunting much, but the other three did, so he indulged them. One day, the three friends said they would like to go hunting bears in Canada. The protagonist couldn't think of a good excuse not to go so they agreed. They flew out of Fort Wayne and landed up in Canada on the water. They holed up in a cabin in the north woods, where they discussed the idea of hunting bears. They all decided that it was not something they actually wanted to do any more because of fear, but they were worried if they returned without a trophy bear, people would think less of them. They decided to split a deck of cards and whoever drew the high card would hunt the bear and the others would butcher and skin it. The protagonist drew the high card, and ended up going out on the hunt. When he encountered the bear it took him by surprise, as it was much larger than expected. He had not even seen a picture of a bear that size. He aimed the gun, but it didn't fire, because he forgot to load it. At this time, he decided to make a run for it back to the cabin. Once he got back he closed the door behind him. He reminisced that since this encounter, he had not been invited back on any more hunting trips. The story was being remembered 30 years after it happened."

Guess who it was that ended up going hunting, it was me. My friends said that they would skin tans pack the bear when I brought it back. I went out to find one and saw it. It was THE BIGGEST bear I had ever seen, even bigger than ones I had seen in photos. I took a shot with my gun but the gun was not loaded. I ran towards the cabin but the bear did not want me in his territory. He ran also. When I got back, I slammed the door and told my friends that the bear is ‘RIGHT OUTSIDE’. I told them that ‘THEY CAN SKIN IT AND PACK IT’. Despite what happened, my friends thought I did a pretty good job at my task. That was thirty years ago and I haven’t been asked to go bear hunting again since."
