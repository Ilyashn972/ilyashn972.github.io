141,"I met my three friends in college in 1949. We had been high school athletes at different schools. We became good friends after attending the same college. I was the one from a farm; they lived in the city. They liked visiting my farm to hunt and do chores. We went rabbit and squirrel hunting together. I never enjoyed hunting but joined them anyway. They decided to go bear hunting in Canada. I wasn't interested in bear hunting but agreed to go. We flew from Fort Wayne to Canada. We landed on a lake and paddled in canoes. We backpacked to a rented cabin in the north woods. The territory was spooky and unnerving to me. We settled in the cabin and stored our groceries. None of us wanted to hunt bears due to fear. We spent days playing cards, eating, and sleeping. We realized we needed to have a bear to show. We drew cards to decide who would hunt the bear. I drew the high card and had to hunt. I was reluctant but agreed to try. I walked through the woods for hours without luck. I heard a noise and saw a huge bear. I raised my gun but it wasn't loaded. The bear chased me as I ran to the cabin. I yelled for my friends to open the door. I reached the cabin and turned the bear inside. I closed the door with the bear inside. I jokingly told them to skin the bear. Thirty years later, I reflect on this story. My friends agreed I fulfilled my commitment. They never asked me to hunt again. I still can't believe I was the one with the high card. The experience was more nerve-wracking than thrilling. The story became a memorable tale among us. I initially resisted going on the hunting trip. The trip became a humorous and legendary event. I always felt more comfortable at the farm. The bear encounter was a close call. I laugh at the irony of the situation now. Hunting isn't my idea of fun or excitement. Our college friendship was bonded by adventures. The trip showed me how crazy our ideas could be. Despite fears, I followed through with their plans. I cherish the memories of our wild adventures. We were young and seeking thrilling experiences. The story remains a funny highlight of my life. The bear hunting trip is a cherished memory. I appreciate the friendships formed back then. Urban guys loved the novelty of farm life.",2247,228.27,227.58,49,50,1
