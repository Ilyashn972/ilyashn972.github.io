They all used to go out and hang out together on the farm, help with chores and then go out hunting for rabbits and squirrels. They got onto talking and planning a visit to Canada to go and hunt bears. Farm boy didnt want to go as he had no interest but he did go as not to let the group down. They stayed in an old cabin in the woods and all of them were quite unnerved by the general spookiness of the area, so they didnt go hunting at all. They stayed in and played cards, eating and drinking the days away. They got to the last day and had to pick cards as to who was actually going to go out and find a bear for them to take back with them. Farm boy got the highest card so had to go out looking for a bear, even though he hadnt wanted to go on the trip at all in the first place! He had an old gun from the cabin with him, and eventually came across a bear. He turned to shoot the bear and had actually forgotten to load the gun! He started running as the bear chased him down, as fast as he could run to try and get back to the cabin. He shouted out for the other guys to open the door, and as he got to the door he stepped aside and the bear ran into the cabin where the guys were. He closed the door on them! He said he has not been asked on a hunting trip ever since, and this was 30+ years ago now."

They decided recently to go bear hunting which the story teller was not really interesting in. But he was talked into it and he agreed to go. They flew to some lake in Canada for the bear hunting. After arrival, they spent about four days playing cards and just having fun. They had told a lot of people that they were going bear hunting and thought it would be embarrassing to return without any bear. So they decided whoever wins the card game goes for the hunt and the rest of the would skin the bear. The story teller won the game and he had to go. He simply went out, saw a very big bear and tried to shoot, only to realize that his gun was not loaded. So things took a turn, the story teller ended up being hunted by the huge huge bear.

He was from a farm while the other 3 were from the city. So The city ones were really fascinated by the outdoors because they havent really experianced it much before, but as for our main character from the farm he had enough the outdoors. But after being apart of the group for so long the 3 city ones wanted to try hunting. The farm guy did not like the idea too much and didnt like it even more when he figured out they wanted to go bear hunting in canada. He didnt back out of going though because he couldnt find a reason to say no. So the four of them end up going to Canada to try bear hunting. After driving for as long as they could drive to get to their destination the road ends. They have to backpack what feels like 500miles to get to the cabin they were going to be staying at. But when everyone gets there its really spooky. The cabin is old and they are in the middle of no where. So instead of bear hunting the 4 guys decide to stay in the cabin and play card games for 4 days. They did not go outside at nighttime and hunkered down in the cabin. After 3-4 days though someone says ""people back home are going to real mean to us if we don't come back with a bear, because they all know that were going bear hunting out in the forest"". So the group of friends decide that they need to get a bear. But because none of them want to they play a card game for it. The loser would have to get the bear and the winners would have to skin butcher and bag the bear meat. Our main character the one that didnt even want to be there in the first place loses and has to go hunt a bear. So he sets out to find a bear in the forest. He spends hours out there looking for this bear but cant find anything. Eventually he turns around and sees a huge bear directly behind him. A bear bigger than any bear he has ever seen before even in pictures. So he immediately tries to shoot the bear, but he forgot to load his gun. So in panic the only thing he can do is run. He starts running as fast as he could. He recalls being a fast runner in the past but the old bear is still gaining on him. As he is getting closer to the cabin where everyone else is he yells ""OPEN THE DOOR, OPEN DOOR"". The other guys open the door for him and he rushes inside and close the door behind him locking the bear out and says, ""Well I brought you guys the bear, you better get to skinning"". After 30 years the 3 guys still say he completed his task of bringing a bear back. But for some reason they never invited him to go hunting again."

I knew them before joining graduate school. We knew each other as we took part in sporting events. When we joined Graduate school, we found out we were all in the same school and got to know each other better. I grew up in a farm and from a village while the other three were from the city. We used to go hunting while we were free and they used to come to my farm and hunt rabbits and squirrels. I was not very interested as it was not new for me, but they really enjoyed it. Once they mentioned they were all done with rabbit hunting and we should go bear hunting. I was not hepped up about it, but since I was part of the group I let them talk me into it. So we flew out of the airport from Fort Wayne into some part of Canada and landed on a lake. From there, we went hiking for about 500 miles into the north woods. We had to reach a cabin where we would stay. We reached the cabin and it was a spooky place. We did not go bear hunting and all for three days was play cards and drink. After 3 days one of the friends said we need to go bear hunting as many people from our place knew we had gone to hunt a bear and if we returned empty handed it would not be good for us. so we need to get a bear and either hunt it or take one back to our place. I was not interested to go. It was decided to play a game of cards and whoever had the highest number at the end of the game would go to hunt the bear and the other three will stay and do the skinning and cutting the meat so it can be taken back with us. So the card game started and guess who had the highest card! the one who was least interested in hunting the bear. Yes, then I picked up a gun and left to hunt the bear on my own. I kept walking but there was nothing to be found, after quite a while, I heard a noise, when I went to check I saw the biggest old bear I had ever seen in my life. It did not look happy to see me in its territory. I took out the gun, aimed to shoot, when I pressed the trigger nothing happened, I realised the gun was not loaded and made a run for it. I ran as hard as I could, but the bear was closing in on my heels, after coming out of the woods, I could see the cabin and I shouted OPEN THE DOOR! OPEN THE DOOR! as I reached the door and turned left and closed the door. I shouted to my friends, I got the bear its outside, now go and skin it and cut the meat out of it. Its been 30 years since that happened and after that incident."

Although they met in college, they previously knew each other though from high school days. So, when they met in college, that is when they became close. This particular guy grew up on a farm, however, his three friends grew up in the city. So, at times, his friends would go to the farm to be with him where they would go rabbit hunting. Hunting brought a lot of joy to his friends since they were city guys, but to him, there was nothing extraordinary about it since he'd grown up on a farm. So, they continued to do this for several years until one of his friends suggested that they go bear hunting. Although he wasn't too hyped up about this idea, he decided to go along. So, they flew to Canada, ended up on some lake, then hiked into the mountains until they reached the cabin where they would be staying. While there though, since it was quite spooky in the woods, his friends chickened out of bear hunting. So, they stayed in the cabin for a couple of days playing cards, eating and sleeping, but still just not being in the mood to go hunting for bears out of fear. However, one of the friends then said that there was no way that they could return back home without a bear otherwise they would be ridiculed. So, they decided that one of them would go hunt for the bear and the others would skin the bear and cut it into pieces. However, although the story-teller was still not super-stoked about this idea, sadly the bet fell on him to go out in the woods to hunt for the bear. So, he did and while in the woods, he encountered the biggest and oldest bear that he had ever seen. Sadly, he realised at he was about to shoot the bear that he had forgotten to load the rifle. So he ran for his life back to the cabin screaming for his friends to open the door with the bear hot on his heels. As the door opened, he took a sharp left turn and the bear ran straight into the cabin. Upon which he declared to his friends that he had done his part and brought the bear for them to skin...which they could not deny. The story concludes by saying that although this happened thirty years ago, none of his friends have ever suggested going bear-hunting again."

Before, he was acquainted with them because they all went to separate high schools but were all athletes who saw each other in passing. Anyway, they got close in college and the man lived on the farm and the other three lived in the city. Because of this, the three would love to come to the farm and help the man do chores or do ""macho"" stuff like hunting. They liked hunting squirrels and small things, but the man wasn't as interested because this was his regular life and it wasn't exciting. He went along with it because he wanted to be part of the group though. Later on, maybe a couple of years, the three friends wanted to go on a hunting trip to hunt bear, and although the man wasn't that interested now either, he agreed to go for the same reason as before. So, they all went to the northern woods where one of the friends rented a cabin. On the journey, they encounter scary bears and the woods itself was scary, had to paddle for forever in kayaks, and when they got the cabin eventually they all decided to stay inside because they were spooked. Inside they played card games and stuff, and near the end of the 3-4 day trip, they decided that because they told everyone back at home they'd catch a bear, then they needed to bring a bear back. They played a game to decide who would go out and shoot the bear and bring it back for the others to skin and pack. Funnily, the farmer man who didn't even want to go in the first place got the short end of the stick. He got a gun and went out though, as a man of his word. He happened to come across a bear, but it was a HUGE bear. Bigger than anything the man's seen or heard of. He tried to shoot it, but he realized he didn't load the gun. So, the only thing he could do was run because now he's angered the bear. He ran with the bear hot on his heels and went back to the cabin screaming for his three friends to open the door. They opened the door, he went inside, but the bear ended up following him in too. The man told his friends 'alright, I brought the bear to you guys to skin and pack'. It was a funny story and years later, his friends never invited him out to hunt again but knew he was a man of his word."

He was walking round and couldn't find anything but then he heard a noise and turned round and saw a big old bear the biggest he had ever seen.

We never left the cabin until one of them said that one of us has to go out and shoot a bear because lots of people know that we went bear hunting and it would be embarrassing to go back without a bear. So we had to draw straws and guess who got the short straw? me. The person who does not like to hunt and did not want even come on this trip. So off I went into the forest and came across the biggest bear that I have ever seen. This bear was so big that I have not even seen pictures of a bear so big. I pointed my gun and fired but nothing happened because I forgot to load my gun. The bear heard me and I started to run. I ran to the cabin and the bear gave chase. I got to the cabin and banged on the door. The door opened and the bear came sliding in to the cabin. I told my friends you wanted a bear, well there it is, you can skin it and bag it. My friends never asked me to come hunting with them again."
