Although they became friends in college, they had known of each other from high school as athletes. The narrator describes how the friends, who lived in the city, enjoyed visiting his farm, where they would hunt rabbits and squirrels, an activity that captivated them more than it did the narrator, who wasn't a fan of hunting. An adventurous proposal led the group to plan a bear hunting trip in Canada, despite the narrator's lack of enthusiasm for hunting, especially bears. Yielding to peer pressure, he joined them on a journey that involved flying, paddling canoes, and backpacking through the wilderness to a remote cabin. However, the daunting atmosphere of the woods dampened everyone's spirit for the hunt, resulting in several days spent indoors playing cards and avoiding night outings. Faced with the prospect of returning home empty-handed and enduring the ridicule of friends and family, they decided to draw cards to see who would venture out for the hunt. Ironically, the reluctant narrator drew the high card, obliging him to go bear hunting.

15,173.59,0.11,"The story revolves around the narrator and his three friends, whom he met when they all attended the same college in 1949. They knew of each other from their high school athletics days but became close friends in college. The narrator, who grew up on a farm, often hosted his city-dwelling friends for hunting trips on his family property, although he personally didn't enjoy hunting. Eventually, his friends suggest a bear hunting trip in Canada, a venture the narrator is not keen on but goes along with due to group pressure. They travel by plane and then canoe deep into the Canadian woods to a rented cabin. Despite initially planning to hunt, the group spends several days inside the cabin, too spooked by the eerie wilderness to venture out at night. Realizing they'd return empty-handed and face ridicule, they decide to cut cards to choose who will hunt a bear. Inevitably, the narrator, the least interested in the hunt, draws the high card. Reluctantly, he goes out to hunt but forgets to load his gun. He encounters an enormous bear, which charges at him. Panicked, he runs back to the cabin, closely pursued by the bear. Upon reaching the cabin, he yells for his friends to open the door, and as he reaches it, he quickly turns aside, letting the bear barrel inside instead. He then shuts the door and, with a bit of cheek, tells his friends, ""There he is, fellows, you skin him, I'll go get another one."" The story concludes with the narrator noting that despite fulfilling his inadvertent role in the hunt, his friends have never invited him to hunt again in the thirty years since the incident.",6.1,13.69,2.45,-0.25,-2.98,5.52,8.19,0.57,-2.27,1.21,-0.07,5.98,2.45,3.68,5.04,0.29,-6.89,-0.4,10.07,-1.11,0.3,-2.35,-0.48,2.7,0.78,0.34,1.65,-1.45,8.72,2.38,-0.33,-0.23,1.75,2.07,0.05,-0.41,-3.0,-1.72,-0.21,1.74,2.19,-0.19,3.75,0.48,-2.86,-1.02,-4.83,4.03,-0.54,2.09,-1.0,3.86,0.58,-0.6,-0.31,0.64,4.84,1.72,-1.07,0.53,0.5,0.35,0.19,0.94,4.59,0.44,-1.02,0.2,0.59,2.28,-3.46,2.2,0.82,-0.53,-0.0,7.8,3.88,5.47,-0.21,0.14,2.74,-1.05,1.79,3.66,-1.56,0.82,0.52,0.29,0.16,0.58,-0.25,-2.54,-0.15,0.93,3.36,0.17,-0.16,-0.16,0.45,0.54,0.49,-1.14,-0.47,0.54,0.39,1.72,2.38,0.53,-0.64,-1.39,5.12,6.67,5.04,3.49,-0.82,11.63,2.95,13.27,7.25,2.87,-0.13,2.67

The narrator is a farm kid, while the others are from the city. They often visited the narrator’s farm to help with chores and go hunting, which was more thrilling for them than for the narrator, who was used to the outdoors. Years later, the friends planned a bear hunting trip in Canada. Reluctantly, the narrator agreed to go, despite having no real interest in hunting, especially bears. They flew to Canada, took a canoe trip into the remote woods, and eventually reached a cabin. Once there, none of them actually wanted to venture into the woods to hunt because it seemed too spooky. After spending days playing cards and avoiding hunting, they realized they needed to bring a bear back to avoid being mocked by others back home. They decided to draw cards to see who would go out to hunt, and the narrator, the least interested, drew the high card. Forced to go hunting, the narrator set out with a gun but forgot to load it. When a massive bear appeared, the narrator had no choice but to flee back to the cabin, yelling for the door to be opened.
