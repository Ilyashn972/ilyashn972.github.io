1,This is a story about three of my friends,This tale revolves around three companions of mine
2,that I met in 1949,whom I encountered in the year 1949
3,when I started college.,at the onset of my university journey.
4,"Actually I met them before that,","In truth, our paths crossed even earlier,"
5,we became friends after we all...,but our friendship solidified after we all...
6,went to school at the same place.,pursued our education at the same institution.
7,"Previous to that during high school we'd all been high school athletes at different schools,","Beforehand, during our high school years, we were athletes at various schools,"
8,and so we were acquainted.,which is how we came to know of each other.
9,"But then after graduation when we all enrolled in school,","However, it was post-graduation, upon enrolling in college,"
10,"we found that the four of us were all now attending the same school,","that we discovered we were all matriculating at the same university,"
11,and we became quite good friends.,leading to a strong bond of friendship among us.
12,"I was the kid from the farm,","I hailed from a rural farmstead,"
13,the other three guys all lived in the city.,while the other three resided in urban areas.
14,"So being big macho men that we all were,","Given our robust, masculine personas,"
15,"they used to like to come out to the farm and hunt,","they enjoyed visiting the farm to engage in hunting,"
16,"and they'd come out,","often making the trip out,"
17,and help me do chores and things like that.,and assisting with various farm tasks.
18,Then we'd go rabbit hunting and squirrel hunting and things of that nature.,"We would then go hunting for rabbits, squirrels, and the like."
19,I never really enjoyed hunting.,Hunting never truly appealed to me.
20,"Uh ... being born and raised on the farm I was used to the outdoors,","Having grown up on a farm, I was accustomed to the outdoors,"
21,wasn't all that exciting to me.,and it didn't thrill me much.
22,"But these guys got a big kick out of it,","However, the others found great enjoyment in it,"
23,so I'd go along just to be one of the group.,so I participated merely to fit in with the group.
24,"Things went on,","As time passed,"
25,"we did this for several years,","this became a tradition for several years,"
26,"they were always coming out to the farm,",with them consistently visiting the farm
27,and hunting.,for hunting expeditions.
28,"After we'd been acquainted for several years,","After knowing each other for many years,"
29,one of them got the idea they'd like to go bear hunting up in Canada.,one proposed the idea of bear hunting in Canada.
30,"Now that didn't really appeal to me,","The concept didn't particularly attract me,"
31,"but I'd always been one of the group,","but I had always been part of the group,"
32,"and I couldn't find any real reason not to go,","and couldn't justify a reason to decline,"
33,"so I left them talk me into it,","thus I was persuaded to join,"
34,wasn't too hepped up on this at all.,albeit with little enthusiasm.
35,"I don't care anything really much about hunting period,","I'm not particularly fond of hunting in general,"
36,let alone bear hunting.,especially not bear hunting.
37,Be about my luck the bear would wind up hunting me.,I figured I might end up being the one hunted by the bear.
38,"But as I said,","But as mentioned,"
39,I left them talk me into it.,they convinced me to participate.
40,"So we took an airplane out of Fort Wayne,","So we departed from Fort Wayne by plane,"
41,"and we flew way up into Canada some place,","flying deep into the Canadian wilderness,"
42,"and we landed on a lake,","where we touched down on a lake,"
43,"and then we rented canoes,","then hired canoes,"
44,"and paddled for another ... day and a half it seemed to me,","and paddled for what felt like a day and a half,"
45,'till we got way up in the north woods.,until we reached the remote northern forests.
46,"Then after we ... went as far as we could in the canoes,","After canoeing as far as possible,"
47,"then we had to backpack for another ... five hundred miles I thought,",we trekked what seemed like five hundred miles
48,'till we got to this cabin that they had rented way up there in the north woods.,to reach a secluded cabin deep in the northern woods that had been rented.
49,"And after I got there,","Upon arrival,"
50,"I was even more apprehensive than I had been even before we started,","my apprehension grew even more than before we set out,"
51,'cause I didn't really need any part of that.,since I had no interest in being there.
52,"That was pretty spooky looking territory, let me tell you.","The area looked ominously unwelcoming, I must say."
53,"So we got up there,","Once we arrived,"
54,"and got set up in the cabin,","we settled into the cabin,"
55,and ... got our groceries stored and everything.,and stored our provisions accordingly.
56,And after we got to discussing it,"Upon discussing our situation,"
57,those guys weren't any more hot about going out in those woods and looking for a bear than I was.,it turned out none of us were eager to venture into the woods in search of a bear.
58,"We sat around there for three or four days,","We spent several days just lounging around,"
59,"played cards,","engaging in card games,"
60,"and ate,","eating well,"
61,"and slept,","and resting up,"
62,and we just couldn't ...,unable to muster the enthusiasm to...
63,no one was in the mood to go out and hunt bear,embark on a bear hunt in such a foreboding environment.
64,'cause that's just a plain old spooky looking place.,The place was simply too eerie.
65,"We never ventured outside at night,","We never dared to go out at night,"
66,we stayed right there in the old cabin.,opting to remain within the safety of the cabin.
67,"Well after we'd been there for three or four days,","After a few days of this routine,"
68,"we got to talking it over,","we began to reconsider our plans,"
69,"and somebody said “Hey,","and someone suggested, ""Hey,"
70,if we don't go out and hunt some bear ...,if we don't actually hunt a bear...
71,"we've got to find a bear to take back home with us,","we need to bring one back to avoid ridicule,"
72,"or we're really going to get a bad time from the rest of the people,","or we'll face endless teasing from others,"
73,"'cause too many people know we'd gone bear hunting,","since too many knew of our bear hunting trip,"
74,and if we come home skunked with no bear they're really going to give us a bad time.”,"and returning empty-handed would invite mockery."""
75,"Soo ... no one wanted to go out,","Reluctant to venture out,"
76,so we all decided that we'd cut the cards.,we all agreed to a game of chance with the cards.
77,"Whoever got the high card ... would go out and get a bear,","The one drawing the highest card would have to hunt a bear,"
78,"and the rest of them would skin him butcher him and pack him back down,","while the others would take care of skinning, butchering, and transporting it back,"
79,so we could take him home with us.,so we could bring it home.
80,"So you know who YOU KNOW WHO got the high card,","Predictably, the high card fell to the least willing participant,"
81,the guy that didn't even want to be there in the first place.,the one who never wanted to be there.
82,But I had agreed to play the game ...,But I had consented to the rules of the game...
83,"So ... I took the old gun,","So, I grabbed the rifle,"
84,and I go out bear hunting.,and set out on a bear hunt.
85,I didn't like this at all.,I was far from pleased with the situation.
86,"I'm walking out there in the woods for hours it seems like,","I wandered the forest for what felt like eternity,"
87,"and I just wasn't seeing any bears or anything,","without spotting any bears or wildlife,"
88,"and finally I heard a noise,","until at last I heard a rustling sound,"
89,"and I turned around,","and spun around,"
90,"and there was the biggest old bear I'd ever seen in my life,","to be met with the largest bear I had ever laid eyes on,"
91,I'd never even seen a PICTURE of one THAT big.,far bigger than any I had seen in images.
92,"I whipped up the gun,","I hastily aimed the firearm,"
93,"and pulled the trigger,","and squeezed the trigger,"
94,and nothing happened.,only to realize I had neglected to load the weapon.
95,I'd forgot to LOAD that turkey.,"The bear, uninterested in sharing his domain,"
96,Well he had ...,made a beeline towards me.
97,"he just had no desires to have me in his territory,","With no other option, I took off running,"
98,and he made for me.,"and I dashed away as fast as I could,"
99,"Well there was nothing for me to do but run,","realizing that my past speed was no match for the bear's pace,"
100,"and I turned around,",who was rapidly closing in on me...
101,"I ran as hard as I could go,","As the cabin came into view,"
102,"and I thought I used to be pretty fast,","I began to shout, ""UNLOCK THE DOOR, UNLOCK THE DOOR!"""
103,"but that old bear,","I raced towards the cabin with all my might,"
104,"man he was gaining,","the bear hot on my trail,"
105,he was just right on my heels ...,nearly at my heels...
106,And when I got within sight of that cabin,"Approaching the cabin,"
107,"I started yelling “OPEN THE DOOR, OPEN THE DOOR!”","I kept screaming for the door to be opened,"
108,"Man I was whipping down there just as hard as I could go,","charging as fast as possible,"
109,"and that old bear right on my tail,","with the bear just a breath away,"
110,"and they opened the door,","they swung the door open,"
111,"and I got right to the cabin door,","and as I reached the threshold,"
112,"I made a quick turn to the left,","I veered sharply to the left,"
113,and that old bear went right on in.,sending the bear barreling inside.
114,"I just reached back,","I quickly reached back,"
115,"and pulled the door shut,","slammed the door shut,"
116,"and said “THERE HE IS FELLOWS,","and declared, ""THERE'S YOUR BEAR, GENTS,"
117,"YOU SKIN HIM,","YOU HANDLE THE SKINNING,"
118,I'LL GO GET ANOTHER ONE!”,"AND I'LL SET OUT FOR ANOTHER!"""
119,"Now all this happened thirty years ago,","This entire episode unfolded three decades ago,"
120,and all my buddies agreed ... that I lived up to my commitment.,and all my friends concurred... that I fulfilled my obligation.
121,"But can you BELIEVE,","But would you believe it,"
122,they haven't asked me to go hunting one time since that day.,they've not once invited me on a hunting trip since that eventful day.
