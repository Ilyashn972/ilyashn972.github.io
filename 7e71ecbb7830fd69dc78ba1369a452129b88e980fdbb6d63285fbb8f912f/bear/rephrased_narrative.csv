1,This is a story about three of my friends, This narrative revolves around three friends of mine
2,that I met in 1949, whom I encountered back in 1949
3,when I started college., during my initial year at college.
4,"Actually I met them before that,"," In fact, our paths crossed even earlier,"
5,we became friends after we all..., but our friendship solidified once we all...
6,went to school at the same place., attended the same educational institution.
7,"Previous to that during high school we'd all been high school athletes at different schools,"," Before this, throughout high school, we had each been athletes at various schools,"
8,and so we were acquainted., which made us somewhat familiar with each other.
9,"But then after graduation when we all enrolled in school,"," However, it was post-graduation, when we all registered at the same college,"
10,"we found that the four of us were all now attending the same school,"," that we discovered we were all at the same institution,"
11,and we became quite good friends., leading to a strong bond of friendship among us.
12,"I was the kid from the farm,"," I hailed from a rural farm background,"
13,the other three guys all lived in the city., while the other three were urban dwellers.
14,"So being big macho men that we all were,"," As the robust men we considered ourselves,"
15,"they used to like to come out to the farm and hunt,"," they enjoyed visiting the farm to engage in hunting,"
16,"and they'd come out,"," often stopping by,"
17,and help me do chores and things like that., to assist with farm chores and similar tasks.
18,Then we'd go rabbit hunting and squirrel hunting and things of that nature.," Our activities included hunting rabbits, squirrels, and the like."
19,I never really enjoyed hunting.," Personally, I was never fond of hunting."
20,"Uh ... being born and raised on the farm I was used to the outdoors,"," Uh... growing up on a farm meant I was accustomed to being outdoors,"
21,wasn't all that exciting to me., which didn't thrill me much.
22,"But these guys got a big kick out of it,"," However, the others really relished these experiences,"
23,so I'd go along just to be one of the group., so I participated simply to stay connected with the group.
24,"Things went on,"," As time passed,"
25,"we did this for several years,"," this became a tradition over several years,"
26,"they were always coming out to the farm,", with frequent visits to the farm for hunting expeditions.
27,and hunting., and engaging in hunting.
28,"After we'd been acquainted for several years,"," After knowing each other for many years,"
29,one of them got the idea they'd like to go bear hunting up in Canada., one friend suggested we try bear hunting in Canada.
30,"Now that didn't really appeal to me,"," I found the idea of bear hunting less than appealing,"
31,"but I'd always been one of the group,"," but I was always part of the crew,"
32,"and I couldn't find any real reason not to go,"," and I couldn't come up with a solid reason to decline,"
33,"so I left them talk me into it,"," so I let them persuade me,"
34,wasn't too hepped up on this at all., though I was far from enthusiastic about it.
35,"I don't care anything really much about hunting period,"," Honestly, I'm not particularly fond of hunting at all,"
36,let alone bear hunting., especially not bear hunting.
37,Be about my luck the bear would wind up hunting me.," Knowing my luck, I'd end up being the one hunted by the bear."
38,"But as I said,"," But as I mentioned,"
39,I left them talk me into it., I let them persuade me.
40,"So we took an airplane out of Fort Wayne,"," So we boarded a plane from Fort Wayne,"
41,"and we flew way up into Canada some place,"," and headed deep into Canada,"
42,"and we landed on a lake,"," where we touched down on a remote lake,"
43,"and then we rented canoes,"," then we hired canoes,"
44,"and paddled for another ... day and a half it seemed to me,"," and paddled for what felt like a day and a half,"
45,'till we got way up in the north woods., until we reached the deep northern forests.
46,"Then after we ... went as far as we could in the canoes,"," After reaching the limit with our canoes,"
47,"then we had to backpack for another ... five hundred miles I thought,"," we then had to hike what seemed like five hundred miles,"
48,'till we got to this cabin that they had rented way up there in the north woods., until we arrived at a secluded cabin deep in the northern woods that they had booked.
49,"And after I got there,"," Once I arrived there,"
50,"I was even more apprehensive than I had been even before we started,"," my apprehension grew even more than before we had left,"
51,'cause I didn't really need any part of that., because I really didn't want any part of this.
52,"That was pretty spooky looking territory, let me tell you."," The area looked ominously eerie, I must say."
53,"So we got up there,"," Eventually, we made it,"
54,"and got set up in the cabin,"," settled into the cabin,"
55,and ... got our groceries stored and everything., and organized our supplies and groceries.
56,And after we got to discussing it," And when we finally talked it over,"
57,those guys weren't any more hot about going out in those woods and looking for a bear than I was., it turned out none of the guys were eager to venture into the woods in search of a bear either.
58,"We sat around there for three or four days,"," We ended up spending three or four days just hanging out,"
59,"played cards,"," playing cards,"
60,"and ate,", and eating.
61,"and slept,"," and we rested,"
62,and we just couldn't ..., finding ourselves unable to ...
63,no one was in the mood to go out and hunt bear, as no one felt inclined to pursue bear hunting
64,'cause that's just a plain old spooky looking place., given the eerie nature of the surroundings.
65,"We never ventured outside at night,"," Venturing out after dark was out of the question,"
66,we stayed right there in the old cabin., so we remained securely within the confines of the rustic cabin.
67,"Well after we'd been there for three or four days,"," Several days into our stay,"
68,"we got to talking it over,"," we began to discuss our situation,"
69,"and somebody said “Hey,"," when someone exclaimed, “Hey,"
70,if we don't go out and hunt some bear ..., if we don't actually hunt some bear ...
71,"we've got to find a bear to take back home with us,"," we need to secure at least one bear to bring back,"
72,"or we're really going to get a bad time from the rest of the people,"," otherwise, we'll face ridicule from others,"
73,"'cause too many people know we'd gone bear hunting,"," since too many knew of our bear hunting expedition,"
74,and if we come home skunked with no bear they're really going to give us a bad time.”, and returning empty-handed would only invite mockery.”
75,"Soo ... no one wanted to go out,"," Reluctantly, no one was eager to venture out,"
76,so we all decided that we'd cut the cards., leading us to agree on a game of chance with the cards.
77,"Whoever got the high card ... would go out and get a bear,"," The person drawing the highest card ... would be tasked with hunting a bear,"
78,"and the rest of them would skin him butcher him and pack him back down,"," while the others would handle the skinning, butchering, and packing for the journey home,"
79,so we could take him home with us., ensuring we had a bear to show for our efforts.
80,"So you know who YOU KNOW WHO got the high card,"," Predictably, guess who drew the high card,"
81,the guy that didn't even want to be there in the first place., the very person least enthusiastic about our location.
82,But I had agreed to play the game ...," Yet, I had consented to the rules of the game ..."
83,"So ... I took the old gun,"," So, I grabbed the old rifle,"
84,and I go out bear hunting., and set out to hunt bear.
85,I didn't like this at all., I was far from pleased with the situation.
86,"I'm walking out there in the woods for hours it seems like,"," Trekking through the forest for what felt like endless hours,"
87,"and I just wasn't seeing any bears or anything,"," without a bear in sight,"
88,"and finally I heard a noise,"," until suddenly I detected a sound,"
89,"and I turned around,"," spun around,"
90,"and there was the biggest old bear I'd ever seen in my life,"," and there it was, the largest bear I had ever encountered."
91,I'd never even seen a PICTURE of one THAT big., I had never even glimpsed an image of one so enormous.
92,"I whipped up the gun,"," I quickly raised the rifle,"
93,"and pulled the trigger,"," squeezed the trigger,"
94,and nothing happened., but nothing occurred.
95,I'd forgot to LOAD that turkey., I had forgotten to load the weapon.
96,Well he had ...," Clearly, he didn't want..."
97,"he just had no desires to have me in his territory,"," he simply didn't want me in his domain,"
98,and he made for me., and he charged at me.
99,"Well there was nothing for me to do but run,"," My only option was to flee,"
100,"and I turned around,"," so I spun around,"
101,"I ran as hard as I could go,"," and sprinted as fast as I could,"
102,"and I thought I used to be pretty fast,"," thinking I was quite speedy once,"
103,"but that old bear,"," yet that massive bear,"
104,"man he was gaining,"," he was closing in,"
105,he was just right on my heels ..., nearly breathing down my neck...
106,And when I got within sight of that cabin," As the cabin came into view,"
107,"I started yelling “OPEN THE DOOR, OPEN THE DOOR!”"," I began screaming, “OPEN THE DOOR, OPEN THE DOOR!”"
108,"Man I was whipping down there just as hard as I could go,"," I dashed towards it with all my might,"
109,"and that old bear right on my tail,"," with the bear just inches behind,"
110,"and they opened the door,"," and they swung the door open,"
111,"and I got right to the cabin door,"," just as I reached the threshold,"
112,"I made a quick turn to the left,"," I darted left swiftly,"
113,and that old bear went right on in., and the bear continued straight inside.
114,"I just reached back,"," I quickly reached back,"
115,"and pulled the door shut,"," slammed the door shut,"
116,"and said “THERE HE IS FELLOWS,"," and declared, “THERE HE IS BOYS,"
117,"YOU SKIN HIM,"," YOU DEAL WITH HIM,"
118,I'LL GO GET ANOTHER ONE!”, I'LL FETCH ANOTHER!”
119,"Now all this happened thirty years ago,"," This entire ordeal took place thirty years back,"
120,and all my buddies agreed ... that I lived up to my commitment., and all my friends concurred... I had fulfilled my promise.
121,"But can you BELIEVE,"," But can you imagine,"
122,they haven't asked me to go hunting one time since that day., not once have they invited me to hunt since that incident.
