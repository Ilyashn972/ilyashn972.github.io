As youngsters they were in different schools but competed against each other as athletes. They later ended up being in school together and became friends. The narrator was from a farm and the other three from the city. They all spent a lot of time on the farm helping out as the city guys enjoyed hunting. The narrator did not enjoy hunting, but went along with it for the sake of his friends. One day they decided to set off on a trip to Canada bear hunting. They took a plane and then canoed and hiked for many many miles until they reached the cabin in the depth of the woods. Finally realised that they did not want to go out in the night hunting as it was very dark and deserted. They played cards and ate and slept. However, they realised that they would need to take a bear home to prove to people that they had been hunting. They drew cards to see who would go out for the bear and the other three would then skin the bear and pack it to take it home. The narrator drew the short straw so took the gun and head into the woods. He eventually found a bear, the biggest he had ever seen. he raised his gun to shoot but realised that it was not loaded. he ran for his life back to the cabin with the bear in pursuit. The bear followed him into the cabin. He trapped the bear and shouted to his friends that he had called the bear and it was now their turn. After that, he was never invited on hunting trips again."

I was from a farm and they were all from the city. They used to love to come down to the farm and hunt and help me with chores. I wasn't into hunting all that much but I would join in to be a part of the group. One day they decided they wanted to hunt bear in Canada, I didn't want to do this but I was a part of the group. So we went deep into Canada and had to trek another 500 miles to get to the cabin. This place was spooky, we didn't want to hunt the bear once we got there, so for about 3 or 4 days we just sat around the cabin playing cards and stuff. We said we had to hunt the bear though as the people at home would give us a hard time if we didn't come home with a bear as many people knew we went out hunting for a bear. So we agreed that whoever got a high card would have to go out and find the bear. Of course it was me who had to go and hunt the bear while the fellas would skin and pack the bear. For hours I was searching in the forest for the bear, then I heard a noise and it was behind me. The biggest bear I have ever seen, not even the pictures had them this big. So I pointed my gun at him and pulled the trigger. Nothing happened, I forgot the load this turkey. So I ran, I thought I was fast but this bear was gaining on me. When he was on my heels I could see the cabin and I shouted ""open the door!"". That was 30 years ago and those fellas have never asked me to come hunting."

They had gone to school in the same place. Then they met at college in 1949. Their paths had crossed in the past. Despite attending different schools, they had all been athletic. So they had become acquainted. They became good friends after graduation. When they then attended the same school. The author had lived on a farm. But the other three were from the city. The friends used to meet up on the farm to hunt for rabbits and squirrels. The city boys used to enjoy it more than the author. He'd been brought up on the farm. So it was the norm for him. And he didn't get excited by it. This went on for quite a few years. Until one day the young men decided that they would like to go bear hunting in Canada. Whilst the idea didn't really appeal to the author. He was part of the group. And got talked into going along with them. He was concerned that he may be hunted by the bear rather than the other way round. They took an aeroplane. And landed on a lake. It was still a long way to their destination. And they had to hike and use canoes to get there. They reached their cabin. But the author was still apprehensive about the expedition. And described it as spooky. In fact, none of the men wanted to go out into the woods. So they stayed in the cabin for several days. They had taken groceries with them. And played cards. They then discussed the shame of returning home having not hunted a bear. As they had told too many people about it. And knew that there was an expectation. They used the cards to determine who was going to go out to hunt the bear. The person who drew the high card would be the one to go. Unfortunately for the author, it was him. Typical as he was the one that didn't want to be there in the first place. He grabbed his and went into the woods. There was a noise. And he turned around to face the biggest bear ever. He aimed at it with his gun. Then realised he had forgotten to load it. The bear was angry. And started to chase him. Luckily, despite the bear being on his heels, he reached the cabin. And shouted for the others to open the door. He then made a quick left turn. But the bear turned right. Once safely inside the cabin, the author then said to his friends ""There he is. You skin him and I'll go and get another one!"" Thirty years had elapsed. And the friends had had not desire to go hunting ever again."

I really didn't want to go, but they talked me into it. I didn't really have a reason to not go and I let them talk me into it, so we went. We flew to Canada through New Fryer, we got there, from there we went with canons up a lake, where we rented an old cabin, we got there, stored away our groceries, and settled down, no one was really in the mood to go out hunting, neither was I. So we played card games, ate. We stayed like that for 3 or 4 days. At day 3, someone said that we have to go hunting, because so many people know we're here, we can't come back without a bear. So we made a deal that who ever will get the upper card, in the card games we we're playing will need to go hunt the bear alone, and the others will skim him, butcher, pack him home. Guess who got the upper card? me! So I had to go because I agreed to play the game. Here I went to go hunting for a bear, I looked for hours and didn't find anything, till I heard I noise behind me, I turn around and there is the biggest bear I ever saw in my  life, bigger than any bear I ever saw in a photo. I whipped out my gun to shoot the bear, but nothing happed, I FORGIT TO LOAD MY GUN!!!

He wasn't that interested in hunting, but allowed himself to be convinced. The three friends took a plane from Fort Worth and travelled to a cabin in the north woods. The place was so spooky none of them felt like hunting, so they spent the majority of the time playing cards, eating and sleeping. They eventually decided that at least one of them should hunt and kill a bear so as not to face ridicule back home by returning empty-handed.

He attempted to shoot it, but discovered he's forgotten to load his rifle. The bear then chased him back through the woods and all the while he was shouting to his friends to open the cabin door for him.

Subsequent to this, he hasn't been asked on any more hunting trips."
