We met back in 1949. We were in school together. When we graduated, we all went off to school. We found out that we were in the same school. The four of us became good friends. Now I’m a farm boy. I grew up on a farm. The other three were city guys. They’d come over to help out at the farm. Although I didn’t enjoy it much, I went along with them to be with the group. They loved hunting rabbits. I’d join them. One day they mentioned that they wanted to hunt a bear up in Canada. I wasn’t really thrilled at the idea. I had no real reason as to why we couldn’t go. So we packed up and make our way to Canada. We landed in the water. We then canoed as far as we could go. When we got to land, we had to walk 500 miles it seemed like. When we got to the cabin, the forest was spooky. None of the guys wanted to venture outside. We stayed there for three or four days. We played cards. We ate. We slept. One of the guys mentioned that we needed to bring a bear back since a lot of people knew we were coming to hunt bears. Now no one was looking to be the guy that went out in the spooky woods trying to hunt a bear. So me being the farmer went out into the woods. The others were going to skin the bear and prep it to take back with us. When I went outside, I saw the biggest bear anyone’s ever seen. I turned around and started back towards the cabin. I thought I was fast. The bear was gaining. As I got close to the cabin I started yelling OPEN THE DOOR, OPEN THE DOOR. When the guys opened the door, I took a quick left. I quickly shut the door behind the bear. I shouted out, SKIN THE BEAR, I’LL GO FIND US ANOTHER ONE. Now this was 30 years ago. Can you imagine that not one of the guys asked me to go hunting with them since then?"

We knew each other back in 1949. At one point we all attended the same high school. We were athletes on the school team. All the guys were the macho type. They used to love to go hunting. Reluctantly I would go with them. They liked hunting squirrel and other small animals. I didn't have much interest in hunting. I grew up on a farm. I was used to these activities. I was no longer excited by them. After a number of hunting trips the other guys suggested we all fly to Canada. They wanted to try to hunt a bear. Again I wasn't particularly keen to do this. I agreed to go anyway. We flew over to Canada out of Fort Wayne. When we landed we had to paddle in canoes for what seemed like two days. Once back on land we had to trek for a further 500 miles. The guys had rented a cabin in the woods. We had supplies for a few nights. The strange thing is, we didn't go hunting. We just stayed in the cabin, eating, sleeping and playing cards. The woods were really spooky up there. It seemed that the guys had lost all interest in hunting a bear. So we just stayed in the cabin. Towards to the end of our stay one of the guys said we're going to look stupid if we don't come back with a bear. So we decided to draw cards to see who would venture into the woods to kill the bear. The other guys would have the job of skinning and cutting the meat. We drew our cards. Can you believe it? The guy who didn't want to go in the first place drew the bear card. So out I went into the spooky woods. I looked for a bear. Suddenly I looked up and saw a bear. It was huge. I've never even seen a picture of a bear so big. Here was one starring right at me. I whipped up the shotgun. I pulled the trigger. But nothing happened. Like a complete turkey I had only forgot to load the damn thing. That bear was furious. He did not want me on his turf. So I turned and ran like hell. I saw the cabin up ahead. I screamed at the guys to open the door. I jumped into the cabin. I ran to the left. Then shouted, here's the bear I promised. That was over thirty years ago. Do you know what? Those guys have never asked me to come hunting since!"

The protagonist of the story was brought up on the farm and he never really liked hunting, but his group of friends did. One year his friends decided to go bear hunting in Canada so they went to a remote cabin. However when they got there they were all too scared by the woods and stayed in doors for 4-5 days. After that time they drew cards to decided who would go bear hunting because they didnt want to be ridiculed when they got back by everyone who knew they were going bear hunting. Our protagonist drew the card that meant he had to go bring the bear back so his friends would skin and gut it. The protagonist went into the woods with their gun, eventually they came across the biggest bear they had ever seen. They raised their gun and pulled the trigger however there was no shot fired because they had forgotten to load the gun. The protagonist ran as fast as they could back to the cabin shouting open the door. When they got inside they said here is your bear now its your turn to skin it.

We were all on the same athletics team. The other 3 lived in the city however I was brought up on a farm and they liked to come up to the farm to help with chores and hunt. As we grew up we were talking one day and someone mentioned about going bear hunting however I really didn’t want to go. I also didn’t want to disappoint the group so I agreed to go even through I didn’t want to. So we took a flight to the canal where we then had to use canoes to get to the bottom of the mountain which seemed to take forever. Once we got to the mountain we then had to walk what felt like 5 days to get to the cabin. Once we got to the cabin we realised how scary the place was so we decided to stay inside and not go out so we stayed in the cabin playing cards. Towards the end of the break we realised if we didn’t take a bear home with us we would be talked about unkindly so we decided that we would cut cards and whoever got the highest would be the one to go get a bear and the remaining 3 would be the ones to skin the bear ready to take home. Unluckily it was me who got the highest card so I went out in the scary woods looking for a bear. I finally found the biggest bear I had ever seen ( even in a photo!) I shot the gun but it didn’t go off as it hadn’t been loaded. So I ran and ran back towards the cabin. When the cabin was in sight I shouted “open the door” when the door opened I moved to the left and the bear ran in! I told the rest id done my bit! Looking back now the group all agree that I did infact do my bit!
