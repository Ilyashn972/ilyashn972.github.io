4,"Actually I met them before that,",50,11,39,39
35,"I don't care anything really much about hunting period,",62,25,37,37
1,This is a story about three of my friends,57,21,36,36
70,if we don't go out and hunt some bear ...,62,27,35,35
2,that I met in 1949,66,98,-32,32
3,when I started college.,66,97,-31,31
79,so we could take him home with us.,41,10,31,31
20,"Uh ... being born and raised on the farm I was used to the outdoors,",53,23,30,30
30,"Now that didn't really appeal to me,",66,95,-29,29
14,"So being big macho men that we all were,",50,21,29,29
71,"we've got to find a bear to take back home with us,",65,37,28,28
52,"That was pretty spooky looking territory, let me tell you.",58,85,-27,27
81,the guy that didn't even want to be there in the first place.,59,35,24,24
105,he was just right on my heels ...,62,38,24,24
63,no one was in the mood to go out and hunt bear,61,38,23,23
50,"I was even more apprehensive than I had been even before we started,",45,68,-23,23
5,we became friends after we all...,36,59,-23,23
74,and if we come home skunked with no bear they're really going to give us a bad time.”,34,12,22,22
69,"and somebody said “Hey,",45,23,22,22
21,wasn't all that exciting to me.,49,27,22,22
37,Be about my luck the bear would wind up hunting me.,29,7,22,22
33,"so I left them talk me into it,",71,93,-22,22
38,"But as I said,",27,6,21,21
77,"Whoever got the high card ... would go out and get a bear,",79,59,20,20
115,"and pulled the door shut,",66,86,-20,20
22,"But these guys got a big kick out of it,",47,27,20,20
62,and we just couldn't ...,31,12,19,19
73,"'cause too many people know we'd gone bear hunting,",73,55,18,18
113,and that old bear went right on in.,79,97,-18,18
103,"but that old bear,",70,53,17,17
43,"and then we rented canoes,",68,85,-17,17
54,"and got set up in the cabin,",49,66,-17,17
13,the other three guys all lived in the city.,71,88,-17,17
68,"we got to talking it over,",59,42,17,17
11,and we became quite good friends.,68,85,-17,17
49,"And after I got there,",31,15,16,16
67,"Well after we'd been there for three or four days,",37,21,16,16
91,I'd never even seen a PICTURE of one THAT big.,47,31,16,16
114,"I just reached back,",62,78,-16,16
64,'cause that's just a plain old spooky looking place.,39,23,16,16
39,I left them talk me into it.,53,38,15,15
40,"So we took an airplane out of Fort Wayne,",72,86,-14,14
112,"I made a quick turn to the left,",74,88,-14,14
92,"I whipped up the gun,",71,57,14,14
25,"we did this for several years,",24,38,-14,14
6,went to school at the same place.,58,72,-14,14
65,"We never ventured outside at night,",37,23,14,14
31,"but I'd always been one of the group,",58,72,-14,14
102,"and I thought I used to be pretty fast,",68,55,13,13
10,"we found that the four of us were all now attending the same school,",77,90,-13,13
104,"man he was gaining,",72,59,13,13
98,and he made for me.,49,61,-12,12
51,'cause I didn't really need any part of that.,24,12,12,12
44,"and paddled for another ... day and a half it seemed to me,",73,85,-12,12
120,and all my buddies agreed ... that I lived up to my commitment.,59,71,-12,12
96,Well he had ...,28,17,11,11
95,I'd forgot to LOAD that turkey.,48,37,11,11
75,"Soo ... no one wanted to go out,",35,24,11,11
66,we stayed right there in the old cabin.,42,31,11,11
72,"or we're really going to get a bad time from the rest of the people,",78,68,10,10
7,"Previous to that during high school we'd all been high school athletes at different schools,",71,81,-10,10
41,"and we flew way up into Canada some place,",72,82,-10,10
80,"So you know who YOU KNOW WHO got the high card,",86,96,-10,10
15,"they used to like to come out to the farm and hunt,",91,100,-9,9
16,"and they'd come out,",51,42,9,9
85,I didn't like this at all.,30,39,-9,9
60,"and ate,",61,70,-9,9
58,"We sat around there for three or four days,",68,77,-9,9
23,so I'd go along just to be one of the group.,59,68,-9,9
24,"Things went on,",13,22,-9,9
61,"and slept,",57,65,-8,8
107,"I started yelling “OPEN THE DOOR, OPEN THE DOOR!”",87,95,-8,8
45,'till we got way up in the north woods.,49,41,8,8
9,"But then after graduation when we all enrolled in school,",64,72,-8,8
118,I'LL GO GET ANOTHER ONE!”,55,63,-8,8
76,so we all decided that we'd cut the cards.,86,94,-8,8
97,"he just had no desires to have me in his territory,",53,60,-7,7
84,and I go out bear hunting.,40,33,7,7
89,"and I turned around,",62,69,-7,7
87,"and I just wasn't seeing any bears or anything,",54,47,7,7
122,they haven't asked me to go hunting one time since that day.,73,80,-7,7
29,one of them got the idea they'd like to go bear hunting up in Canada.,94,100,-6,6
17,and help me do chores and things like that.,48,42,6,6
47,"then we had to backpack for another ... five hundred miles I thought,",73,79,-6,6
36,let alone bear hunting.,35,29,6,6
108,"Man I was whipping down there just as hard as I could go,",52,46,6,6
34,wasn't too hepped up on this at all.,52,46,6,6
106,And when I got within sight of that cabin,84,78,6,6
55,and ... got our groceries stored and everything.,33,38,-5,5
88,"and finally I heard a noise,",62,57,5,5
101,"I ran as hard as I could go,",81,76,5,5
12,"I was the kid from the farm,",87,92,-5,5
26,"they were always coming out to the farm,",49,54,-5,5
56,And after we got to discussing it,48,44,4,4
86,"I'm walking out there in the woods for hours it seems like,",62,66,-4,4
18,Then we'd go rabbit hunting and squirrel hunting and things of that nature.,85,81,4,4
111,"and I got right to the cabin door,",66,62,4,4
48,'till we got to this cabin that they had rented way up there in the north woods.,75,79,-4,4
57,those guys weren't any more hot about going out in those woods and looking for a bear than I was.,73,76,-3,3
93,"and pulled the trigger,",68,65,3,3
82,But I had agreed to play the game ...,59,62,-3,3
32,"and I couldn't find any real reason not to go,",54,57,-3,3
27,and hunting.,48,50,-2,2
42,"and we landed on a lake,",58,56,2,2
117,"YOU SKIN HIM,",74,72,2,2
83,"So ... I took the old gun,",74,76,-2,2
53,"So we got up there,",33,31,2,2
100,"and I turned around,",78,76,2,2
99,"Well there was nothing for me to do but run,",89,87,2,2
94,and nothing happened.,85,87,-2,2
90,"and there was the biggest old bear I'd ever seen in my life,",91,89,2,2
28,"After we'd been acquainted for several years,",47,45,2,2
19,I never really enjoyed hunting.,80,82,-2,2
109,"and that old bear right on my tail,",48,47,1,1
110,"and they opened the door,",72,71,1,1
121,"But can you BELIEVE,",60,61,-1,1
46,"Then after we ... went as far as we could in the canoes,",52,52,0,0
59,"played cards,",74,74,0,0
116,"and said “THERE HE IS FELLOWS,",78,78,0,0
119,"Now all this happened thirty years ago,",55,55,0,0
8,and so we were acquainted.,55,55,0,0
