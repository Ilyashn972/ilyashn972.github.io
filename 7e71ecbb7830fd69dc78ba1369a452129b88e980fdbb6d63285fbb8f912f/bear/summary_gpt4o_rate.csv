This tradition continued for years until one proposed a bear hunting adventure in Canada, an idea that filled me with little enthusiasm. Despite my hesitations, I joined the journey from Fort Wayne to the Canadian wilderness, where we paddled and hiked to a secluded cabin. The forest was eerie and intimidating. Once settled, we stocked up on supplies but found ourselves hesitant to actually pursue a bear. Instead, we passed the time with card games, indoors, anxious about returning empty-handed. Fatefully, a card draw determined that I would be the one to venture out for the hunt. Armed yet unprepared, I ventured into the forest, encountering no bears until a startling noise revealed a massive one. To my horror, I discovered my gun was unloaded just as the bear began its pursuit. In a frantic dash, I made it back to the cabin, screaming for my friends to let me in. In the chaos, the bear followed me inside. I quickly closed the door behind us, leaving my friends to handle the situation while I volunteered to seek out another bear.

Our journey continued on foot, carrying our gear to a secluded cabin nestled deep in the forest, a place that exuded an eerie vibe that set me on edge. We stocked the cabin with provisions, but none of us were truly enthusiastic about the bear hunt. Instead, we passed the time playing cards and remaining within the safety of the cabin. As time passed, the pressure of returning empty-handed loomed over us. We resorted to drawing cards to select a hunter, and fate had it that I, the reluctant one, drew the high card. With trepidation, I ventured into the forest armed with a gun. My anxiety peaked when I stumbled upon a massive bear. To my horror, I discovered the gun was not loaded just as the bear began its charge. In a frantic escape, I dashed towards the cabin, yelling for my friends to unlock the door. As I neared the cabin with the bear in hot pursuit, my friends flung the door open in the nick of time.

Instead, we passed the time with card games, food, and rest. However, the prospect of returning empty-handed and facing ridicule spurred us to draw cards to determine the designated hunter.

143,2247,0.0929,"I met three friends in college in 1949. We knew each other from high school sports. We all attended the same school after graduation. I was from a farm, and they were from the city. My friends enjoyed visiting the farm for hunting. I did not particularly enjoy hunting. I joined my friends on hunting trips to fit in. My friends suggested a bear hunting trip in Canada. I was hesitant to go bear hunting. I joined the bear hunting trip eventually. We flew to Canada from Fort Wayne. We rented canoes for further travel. We paddled for what seemed like a day and a half. We backpacked to a rented cabin in the north woods. The territory in the north woods was spooky. We set up our cabin and stored groceries. None of us were keen on hunting bears initially. We spent time in the cabin playing cards and eating. We realized we needed to return with a bear. We agreed whoever drew the high card would hunt. I drew the high card and had to hunt. I reluctantly took the gun to hunt bears. I walked in the woods for hours without luck. I encountered a huge bear unexpectedly. I tried to shoot, but the gun wasn't loaded. The bear chased me as I ran for the cabin. I yelled for the door to be opened at the cabin. I barely made it inside with the bear right behind. I managed to trick the bear into the cabin alone. I closed the door to trap the bear inside. I declared my job done to my friends. This event happened thirty years ago. My friends acknowledged I kept my promise. My friends never invited me hunting again. I never really enjoyed hunting bears. The bear incident was both frightening and funny. I was always part of the group despite my reluctance. I was skeptical about the bear hunting adventure. We traveled a long distance to reach the cabin. We procrastinated hunting due to fear. We justified hunting to avoid ridicule back home. The high card agreement was made out of necessity. Encountering the bear was a twist of fate. Forgetting to load the gun was a critical error. The bear chasing me was terrifying. My racing back to the cabin was frantic. Trapping the bear in the cabin was unplanned. My commitment to the group never wavered. I haven't been hunting since the bear incident. The story remains an adventurous memory for us.",208.7,50,49,3,"In 1949, during my college years, I connected with three acquaintances from our high school athletics days. We all pursued further education at the same institution post-high school. Coming from a rural background, I contrasted with their urban upbringing. They found pleasure in hunting on my family's farm, an activity I didn't share their enthusiasm for. Nonetheless, I accompanied them on these excursions to blend in. They proposed a bear hunting expedition in Canada, to which I was initially reluctant. Eventually, I conceded and joined the adventure. We departed from Fort Wayne, flying into Canada. Upon arrival, we hired canoes to continue our journey. It felt like we paddled for a day and a half. Our trek led us to a secluded cabin we had arranged to stay in, deep within the northern forest, an area that exuded an eerie atmosphere. We prepared our cabin and organized our provisions. Initially, none of us were truly eager to pursue bears. We passed the time playing card games and indulging in food. However, the pressure to return with a bear loomed over us. We decided that drawing the highest card would determine the hunter. Fate had me draw that card. With reluctance, I took up the rifle and ventured into the forest. After hours, I stumbled upon a massive bear by chance. In a panic, I discovered the rifle was unloaded. The bear gave chase as I sprinted back to the safety of the cabin, shouting for my friends to open the door. I narrowly escaped inside, with the bear hot on my heels. In a surprising turn of events, I managed to isolate the bear inside the cabin. I triumphantly announced to my companions that I had fulfilled my part. This escapade unfolded three decades ago. They recognized that I had honored our agreement. Following that, they never requested my company on a hunt again. Bear hunting was never my cup of tea. The bear encounter was a blend of horror and humor. Despite my hesitations, I remained an integral part of the group. I had my doubts about the bear hunting trip. The journey to the remote cabin was extensive. Our delay in hunting was driven by trepidation. We felt compelled to hunt to avoid being mocked upon our return. The decision to draw cards was born out of necessity. The bear's appearance was an unexpected twist. My oversight in not loading the gun was a grave mistake. The ensuing chase by the bear was a nightmare. My frantic dash to the cabin was a race against time. The bear's accidental confinement was serendipitous. My dedication to our friendship was steadfast. Since that bear encounter, I have abstained from hunting. The tale has endured as a thrilling recollection among us.",2656,128.23374828216103,0.0483
