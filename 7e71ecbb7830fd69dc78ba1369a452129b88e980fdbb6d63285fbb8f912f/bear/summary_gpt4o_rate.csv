We discussed needing to get a bear to avoid ridicule back home. We decided to cut cards to choose who would hunt the bear. I drew the high card and had to go out to hunt the bear. I was alone in the woods and felt uneasy about it. I encountered a large bear but my gun wasn't loaded. I ran back to the cabin with the bear chasing me. I tricked the bear into entering the cabin and shut it inside.",162.85,22,22,2
80,1300,0.1196,"I met my three friends when I started college in 1949. We knew each other as high school athletes from different schools. We became close friends after attending the same college. I was from a farm, and my friends lived in the city. My friends enjoyed visiting my farm to hunt and help with chores. I didn't enjoy hunting but joined them to be part of the group. Years later, one friend suggested a bear hunting trip in Canada. I wasn't keen on the trip but agreed to go along. We flew to Canada and paddled canoes to a remote cabin. I felt uneasy in the spooky wilderness but went along with it. None of us wanted to hunt bear due to the intimidating setting. We stayed indoors, playing cards and eating for several days. We decided to draw cards to see who would hunt a bear. I ended up with the high card, meaning I had to hunt the bear. I set out to hunt the bear with great reluctance. I encountered a huge bear but realized my gun was not loaded. The bear chased me, and I ran back to the cabin. I shouted for my friends to open the cabin door. I dodged into the cabin, and the bear ran inside. I quickly shut the door as the bear entered, trapping it inside. I told my friends to handle the bear while I pretended to get another. They haven't invited me for any hunting trips since that event.",155.48,22,22,3
