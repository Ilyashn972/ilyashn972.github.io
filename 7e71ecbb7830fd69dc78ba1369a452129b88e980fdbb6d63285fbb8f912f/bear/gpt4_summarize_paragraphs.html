  <p>This is a story about three of my friends that I met in 1949 when I started college. Actually I met them before that, we became friends after we all... went to school at the same place. Previous to that during high school we'd all been high school athletes at different schools, and so we were acquainted. But then after graduation when we all enrolled in school, we found that the four of us were all now attending the same school, and we became quite good friends.</p>

  <p>I was the kid from the farm, the other three guys all lived in the city. So being big macho men that we all were, they used to like to come out to the farm and hunt, and they'd come out, and help me do chores and things like that. Then we'd go rabbit hunting and squirrel hunting and things of that nature.</p>

  <p>I never really enjoyed hunting. Uh ... being born and raised on the farm I was used to the outdoors, wasn't all that exciting to me. But these guys got a big kick out of it, so I'd go along just to be one of the group.</p>

  <p>Things went on, we did this for several years, they were always coming out to the farm, and hunting. After we'd been acquainted for several years, one of them got the idea they'd like to go bear hunting up in Canada. Now that didn't really appeal to me, but I'd always been one of the group, and I couldn't find any real reason not to go, so I left them talk me into it, wasn't too hepped up on this at all.</p>

  <p>So we took an airplane out of Fort Wayne, and we flew way up into Canada some place, and we landed on a lake, and then we rented canoes, and paddled for another ... day and a half it seemed to me, 'till we got way up in the north woods.</p>

<div class="entry">
  <p>Then after we ... went as far as we could in the canoes, then we had to backpack for another ... five hundred miles I thought, 'till we got to this cabin that they had rented way up there in the north woods. And after I got there, I was even more apprehensive than I had been even before we started, 'cause I didn't really need any part of that. That was pretty spooky looking territory, let me tell you.</p>

<div class="entry">
  <p>So we got up there, and got set up in the cabin, and ... got our groceries stored and everything. And after we got to discussing it those guys weren't any more hot about going out in those woods and looking for a bear than I was. We sat around there for three or four days, played cards, and ate, and slept, and we just couldn't ... no one was in the mood to go out and hunt bear 'cause that's just a plain old spooky looking place.</p>

<div class="entry">
  <p>We never ventured outside at night, we stayed right there in the old cabin. Well after we'd been there for three or four days, we got to talking it over, and somebody said “Hey, if we don't go out and hunt some bear ... we've got to find a bear to take back home with us, or we're really going to get a bad time from the rest of the people, 'cause too many people know we'd gone bear hunting, and if we come home skunked with no bear they're really going to give us a bad time.”</p>

  <p>Soo ... no one wanted to go out, so we all decided that we'd cut the cards. Whoever got the high card ... would go out and get a bear, and the rest of them would skin him butcher him and pack him back down, so we could take him home with us.</p>

<div class="entry">
  <p>I'm walking out there in the woods for hours it seems like, and I just wasn't seeing any bears or anything, and finally I heard a noise, and I turned around, and there was the biggest old bear I'd ever seen in my life, I'd never even seen a PICTURE of one THAT big. I whipped up the gun, and pulled the trigger, and nothing happened. I'd forgot to LOAD that turkey.</p>

  <p>Well he had ... he just had no desires to have me in his territory, and he made for me.

I just reached back, and pulled the door shut, and said “THERE HE IS FELLOWS, YOU SKIN HIM, I'LL GO GET ANOTHER ONE!”</p>
