1,This is a story about three of my friends,93.88,57.0,90.0,90.0,-3.88,33.0

3,when I started college.,47.96,66.0,70.0,90.0,22.04,24.0
4,"Actually I met them before that,",36.73,50.0,30.0,30.0,-6.73,-20.0
5,we became friends after we all...,0.0,36.0,40.0,40.0,40.0,4.0
6,went to school at the same place.,23.47,58.0,40.0,30.0,16.53,-28.0
7,"Previous to that during high school we'd all been high school athletes at different schools,",44.9,71.0,40.0,80.0,-4.9,9.0
8,and so we were acquainted.,21.43,55.0,20.0,30.0,-1.43,-25.0
9,"But then after graduation when we all enrolled in school,",12.24,64.0,10.0,70.0,-2.24,6.0
10,"we found that the four of us were all now attending the same school,",21.43,77.0,20.0,80.0,-1.43,3.0
11,and we became quite good friends.,20.41,68.0,30.0,80.0,9.59,12.0
12,"I was the kid from the farm,",80.61,87.0,30.0,70.0,-50.61,-17.0
13,the other three guys all lived in the city.,71.43,71.0,70.0,60.0,-1.43,-11.0
14,"So being big macho men that we all were,",13.27,50.0,10.0,60.0,-3.27,10.0
15,"they used to like to come out to the farm and hunt,",74.49,91.0,30.0,100.0,-44.49,9.0
16,"and they'd come out,",12.24,51.0,10.0,30.0,-2.24,-21.0
17,and help me do chores and things like that.,25.51,48.0,10.0,30.0,-15.51,-18.0
18,Then we'd go rabbit hunting and squirrel hunting and things of that nature.,45.92,85.0,30.0,90.0,-15.92,5.0
19,I never really enjoyed hunting.,62.24,80.0,60.0,100.0,-2.24,20.0
20,"Uh ... being born and raised on the farm I was used to the outdoors,",22.45,53.0,10.0,40.0,-12.45,-13.0
21,wasn't all that exciting to me.,6.12,49.0,0.0,70.0,-6.12,21.0
22,"But these guys got a big kick out of it,",17.35,47.0,0.0,0.0,-17.35,-47.0
23,so I'd go along just to be one of the group.,32.65,59.0,20.0,70.0,-12.65,11.0
24,"Things went on,",0.0,13.0,0.0,10.0,0.0,-3.0
25,"we did this for several years,",13.27,24.0,0.0,20.0,-13.27,-4.0
26,"they were always coming out to the farm,",5.1,49.0,0.0,10.0,-5.1,-39.0
27,and hunting.,2.04,48.0,0.0,30.0,-2.04,-18.0
28,"After we'd been acquainted for several years,",2.04,47.0,10.0,70.0,7.96,23.0
29,one of them got the idea they'd like to go bear hunting up in Canada.,63.27,94.0,40.0,90.0,-23.27,-4.0
30,"Now that didn't really appeal to me,",41.84,66.0,30.0,100.0,-11.84,34.0
31,"but I'd always been one of the group,",13.27,58.0,10.0,60.0,-3.27,2.0
32,"and I couldn't find any real reason not to go,",9.18,54.0,0.0,50.0,-9.18,-4.0
33,"so I left them talk me into it,",30.61,71.0,20.0,70.0,-10.61,-1.0
34,wasn't too hepped up on this at all.,2.04,52.0,0.0,70.0,-2.04,18.0
35,"I don't care anything really much about hunting period,",0.0,62.0,0.0,70.0,0.0,8.0
36,let alone bear hunting.,0.0,35.0,10.0,30.0,10.0,-5.0
37,Be about my luck the bear would wind up hunting me.,1.02,29.0,0.0,20.0,-1.02,-9.0
38,"But as I said,",0.0,27.0,0.0,10.0,0.0,-17.0
39,I left them talk me into it.,4.08,53.0,10.0,20.0,5.92,-33.0
40,"So we took an airplane out of Fort Wayne,",29.59,72.0,20.0,80.0,-9.59,8.0
41,"and we flew way up into Canada some place,",36.73,72.0,30.0,90.0,-6.73,18.0
42,"and we landed on a lake,",14.29,58.0,0.0,60.0,-14.29,2.0
43,"and then we rented canoes,",31.63,68.0,10.0,60.0,-21.63,-8.0
44,"and paddled for another ... day and a half it seemed to me,",12.24,73.0,0.0,70.0,-12.24,-3.0
45,'till we got way up in the north woods.,12.24,49.0,20.0,80.0,7.76,31.0
46,"Then after we ... went as far as we could in the canoes,",0.0,52.0,0.0,50.0,0.0,-2.0
47,"then we had to backpack for another ... five hundred miles I thought,",27.55,73.0,0.0,80.0,-27.55,7.0
48,'till we got to this cabin that they had rented way up there in the north woods.,53.06,75.0,60.0,100.0,6.94,25.0
49,"And after I got there,",0.0,31.0,0.0,20.0,0.0,-11.0
50,"I was even more apprehensive than I had been even before we started,",4.08,45.0,20.0,70.0,15.92,25.0
51,'cause I didn't really need any part of that.,0.0,24.0,0.0,30.0,0.0,6.0
52,"That was pretty spooky looking territory, let me tell you.",26.53,58.0,0.0,50.0,-26.53,-8.0
53,"So we got up there,",0.0,33.0,0.0,10.0,0.0,-23.0
54,"and got set up in the cabin,",5.1,49.0,0.0,10.0,-5.1,-39.0
55,and ... got our groceries stored and everything.,11.22,33.0,0.0,10.0,-11.22,-23.0
56,And after we got to discussing it,3.06,48.0,0.0,80.0,-3.06,32.0
57,those guys weren't any more hot about going out in those woods and looking for a bear than I was.,1.02,73.0,10.0,90.0,8.98,17.0
58,"We sat around there for three or four days,",46.94,68.0,30.0,70.0,-16.94,2.0
59,"played cards,",48.98,74.0,30.0,50.0,-18.98,-24.0
60,"and ate,",30.61,61.0,30.0,50.0,-0.61,-11.0
61,"and slept,",27.55,57.0,30.0,50.0,2.45,-7.0
62,and we just couldn't ...,1.02,31.0,0.0,50.0,-1.02,19.0
63,no one was in the mood to go out and hunt bear,12.24,61.0,30.0,80.0,17.76,19.0
64,'cause that's just a plain old spooky looking place.,16.33,39.0,10.0,40.0,-6.33,1.0
65,"We never ventured outside at night,",8.16,37.0,0.0,30.0,-8.16,-7.0
66,we stayed right there in the old cabin.,2.04,42.0,0.0,30.0,-2.04,-12.0
67,"Well after we'd been there for three or four days,",7.14,37.0,0.0,30.0,-7.14,-7.0
68,"we got to talking it over,",1.02,59.0,0.0,90.0,-1.02,31.0

70,if we don't go out and hunt some bear ...,12.24,62.0,0.0,50.0,-12.24,-12.0
71,"we've got to find a bear to take back home with us,",35.71,65.0,40.0,50.0,4.29,-15.0
72,"or we're really going to get a bad time from the rest of the people,",27.55,78.0,20.0,50.0,-7.55,-28.0
73,"'cause too many people know we'd gone bear hunting,",11.22,73.0,20.0,50.0,8.78,-23.0
74,and if we come home skunked with no bear they're really going to give us a bad time.”,22.45,34.0,40.0,30.0,17.55,-4.0
75,"Soo ... no one wanted to go out,",3.06,35.0,0.0,40.0,-3.06,5.0
76,so we all decided that we'd cut the cards.,38.78,86.0,50.0,100.0,11.22,14.0
77,"Whoever got the high card ... would go out and get a bear,",61.22,79.0,70.0,70.0,8.78,-9.0
78,"and the rest of them would skin him butcher him and pack him back down,",30.61,66.0,0.0,30.0,-30.61,-36.0
79,so we could take him home with us.,5.1,41.0,0.0,30.0,-5.1,-11.0
80,"So you know who YOU KNOW WHO got the high card,",60.2,86.0,80.0,100.0,19.8,14.0
81,the guy that didn't even want to be there in the first place.,40.82,59.0,30.0,60.0,-10.82,1.0
82,But I had agreed to play the game ...,3.06,59.0,0.0,60.0,-3.06,1.0
83,"So ... I took the old gun,",19.39,74.0,0.0,40.0,-19.39,-34.0
84,and I go out bear hunting.,34.69,40.0,20.0,0.0,-14.69,-40.0
85,I didn't like this at all.,4.08,30.0,0.0,0.0,-4.08,-30.0
86,"I'm walking out there in the woods for hours it seems like,",9.18,62.0,0.0,60.0,-9.18,-2.0
87,"and I just wasn't seeing any bears or anything,",2.04,54.0,0.0,30.0,-2.04,-24.0
88,"and finally I heard a noise,",14.29,62.0,0.0,70.0,-14.29,8.0
89,"and I turned around,",7.14,62.0,0.0,70.0,-7.14,8.0
90,"and there was the biggest old bear I'd ever seen in my life,",66.33,91.0,50.0,80.0,-16.33,-11.0
91,I'd never even seen a PICTURE of one THAT big.,18.37,47.0,0.0,40.0,-18.37,-7.0
92,"I whipped up the gun,",13.27,71.0,0.0,50.0,-13.27,-21.0
93,"and pulled the trigger,",19.39,68.0,0.0,70.0,-19.39,2.0
94,and nothing happened.,31.63,85.0,20.0,90.0,-11.63,5.0
95,I'd forgot to LOAD that turkey.,53.06,48.0,50.0,30.0,-3.06,-18.0
96,Well he had ...,1.02,28.0,0.0,20.0,-1.02,-8.0
97,"he just had no desires to have me in his territory,",7.14,53.0,0.0,20.0,-7.14,-33.0
98,and he made for me.,18.37,49.0,10.0,20.0,-8.37,-29.0
99,"Well there was nothing for me to do but run,",19.39,89.0,10.0,100.0,-9.39,11.0
100,"and I turned around,",3.06,78.0,0.0,90.0,-3.06,12.0
101,"I ran as hard as I could go,",20.41,81.0,0.0,80.0,-20.41,-1.0
102,"and I thought I used to be pretty fast,",2.04,68.0,0.0,70.0,-2.04,2.0
103,"but that old bear,",4.08,70.0,0.0,80.0,-4.08,10.0
104,"man he was gaining,",7.14,72.0,0.0,80.0,-7.14,8.0
105,he was just right on my heels ...,3.06,62.0,0.0,80.0,-3.06,18.0

109,"and that old bear right on my tail,",8.16,48.0,20.0,60.0,11.84,12.0
110,"and they opened the door,",22.45,72.0,0.0,60.0,-22.45,-12.0
111,"and I got right to the cabin door,",4.08,66.0,0.0,60.0,-4.08,-6.0
112,"I made a quick turn to the left,",19.39,74.0,0.0,90.0,-19.39,16.0
113,and that old bear went right on in.,42.86,79.0,70.0,100.0,27.14,21.0
114,"I just reached back,",1.02,62.0,0.0,90.0,-1.02,28.0
115,"and pulled the door shut,",20.41,66.0,20.0,90.0,-0.41,24.0
116,"and said “THERE HE IS FELLOWS,",33.67,78.0,30.0,90.0,-3.67,12.0
