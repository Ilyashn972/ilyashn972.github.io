They were 3 macho men, and we all had been athletes. After a few years, one of them suggested that we go up to Canada to go squirrel and rabbit hunting. I didn't really like hunting, but I had done everything with that group, so I left them talk me into it. One of them eventually suggested we go bear hunting instead, so we took a plane up to Fort Wayne, and hiked for a day and a half up to a cabin. The woods were really spooky, and all the others suddenly didn't feel like going bear hunting either, like me. So for a few days we waited in the cabin, eating, sleeping, playing cards, until one of us realised that too many people knew we had gone back bear hunting, so we needed to head back with a bear. They decided, and I agreed, that they would cut cards to decide which one of us would go out, get a bear, and bring it back for the rest to skin and pack so we can take it home. And WHO WOULD HAVE GUESSED, but it was the guy who didn't even want to go hunting in the first place. But I had agreed to this process. So I took our shotgun, went out and walked for hours but didn't find anything, when suddenly I heard a noise, and turned to see the biggest old bear I have ever seen. I aimed my gun and shot it at it, but then realised I had forgotten to load it! But the bear didn't like having me in its territory, so it came after me. I turned and ran. I thought I was pretty fast, but the old bear was gaining on me. I ran as fast as I could back to the cabin, yelling ""OPEN THE DOOR, OPEN THE DOOR"". They opened the door to the cabin, and at the last moment I turned left, the bear turned right into the cabin, and I turned and shut the door. I yelled ""OK I FOUND A BEAR NOW YOU GUYS SKIN AND PACK IT, I WILL GO FIND ANOTHER ONE"". The others couldn't deny that I had done what I had been told to do, but they haven't invited me out hunting since..."

However, they only started being friends after they all found out they were going to the same post-secondary school. The man was a rural boy while his 3 friends were city boys, and because of this the 3 all had a knack for hunting. In 1949, the group decided to go bear hunting, despite the man not really wanting to. They then travelled to Canada via plane and trekked through the woods to get to a cabin, but the eerie atmosphere caused none of them to actually want to go hunting. They thought of the consequences of coming back with no bear, which caused them to decide to send one person out there to hunt, which happened to be the man. He ended up finding a giant old bear, but forgot to load the gun, so he had to run back to the cabin with the bear on his tail, thankfully being safe. 30 years later and his 3 friends haven't asked him to go hunting since."

The boy telling the story grew up on a farm. The other three grew up in the city. For this reason the city boys were quite keen on the idea of hunting. The farm boy was not so thrilled as this was quite normal to his general way of life. They would hunt together on his property. Even though the boy wasn't keen he did it to fit in with the group. One day they all decided to take a trip to northern Canada to try to hunt a bear. The boy was still not keen but was pressured to go with his group. They flew out of Fort Wayne and headed to northern Canada together. They went to some woods where they had rented a spooky looking cabin. For days the boys could not bring themselves to go and look for the bear as they were scared by their surrounding. So they played cards and drank and slept. Before they were due to come home they were worried that people would make fun of them if they came back and had not brought a bear. So they drew cards and the boy telling the story unfortunately drew the short straw (so to speak). He went out into the woods and found a bear. The bear chased him all the way back to the cabin. He let the bear into the cabin and said there you go boys there a bear to skin ill go and get another one. Surprisingly none of his friends ever invited him hunting again.

The narrator wasn't interested in hunting but went along with it as the rest of the group were interested. Eventually one of the group decided they should go bear hunting. They got a plane to Fort Wayne and then another plane into Canada where they landed on a lake, canoed for a day and a half and hiked what the narrator believed to be 500 miles to the cabin they had rented. When they got there, it was so remote and spooky that none of them wanted to go hunting. They stayed in the cabin, ate, slept and played cards until one of the group decided they had to go home with proof they had hunted a bear or else they would be teased for not going through with it. They decided to play a game and whoever got the high card from the deck would go out and hunt the bear while the others would skin it and prepare it for being brought home. The narrator drew the high card and went out to hunt a bear. After walking through the woods he came upon a huge old bear. This bear was bigger than even any picture of a bear the narrator had ever seen. He took aim with his gun, pulled the trigger but nothing happened. He had forgotten to load the gun. So he started running back towards the cabin and as he neared it he started shouting to his friends to open the door which they did. The narrator ran inside and told his friends that he got the bear and now it was their turn to skin him! They've never gone hunting since in the intervening 30 years."

One day, the three friends brought a suggestion to go bear hunting in Canada. The man did not want to but he let them talk him into it. They packed up, took a flight up to Canada. They landed on a lake, paddled in a canoe for what seemed like a day and a half, and then hiked what seemed like 500 miles before arriving at a cabin in the woods that they had rented. Upon settling down in the cabin, they all decided that they weren't exactly hyped up about going bear hunting. So for the next three or four days, they stayed indoors, played card games, and ate. On the third or fourth day, one of them brought it up that they had to get a bear so as not to disappoint the people waiting for them back at home. To decide who goes out to hunt the bear, they drew cards. The person with the highest card had to go hunt the bear, while the others would skin it and prepare it for travel. After they drew cards, it turned out it was the man who did not even want to go in the first place that got the highest card. He took the old gun and set out. After what seemed like hours, he heard a growl behind and looked back to see the biggest bear he had ever seen in his life. He picked up the gun and fired, but nothing happened. Turned out he had forgotten to load the gun. He turned on his heels and started running as fast as he could, with the bear on his heels. When he got in sight of the cabin, he started shouting for them to open the door. The door opened, but instead of going in, he took a left around the cabin, while the bear went straight inside. He quickly closed the cabin door and told his friends that he had brought the bear, it was their turn to skin it. Eventually, they agreed that he actually played his part. Although this happened 30 years ago, they never asked him to go hunting since that day."

He wasn't a fan of hunting like the other guys were but always tagged along, from rabbit to squirrel hunting. About thirty years ago, they decided to go bear hunting up in north woods in Canada. He was not happy to go with it but decided to. They were in a cabin for 3/4 days without wanting to go bear hunting because the area was so spooky. Eventually, one of them psyched the boys to go bear hunting because everyone knew they had travelled to hunt for bears and it would be a bummer if they returned empty-handed. So they drew cards to decide who would go, and it fell on the storyteller, who never wanted to be there in the first place. His role was to hunt for the bear while the others skinned and prepared the bear to be taken home. As he went into the woods, he saw a big bear bigger than he had seen in pictures and tried to shoot at it. Unfortunately, his gun was not loaded so nothing happened and immediately he ran towards the cabin, trying to get away from the bear. The bear was very fast, and right behind his heel, even though he considered himself a fast runner. As he approached the cabin, he shouted at his friends to open the cabin door and let him in, and just as he drew near the door, he swiftly turned left, letting the bear into the cabin. He screamed, that he had fulfilled his role and it was left for his friends to skin and prep the bear."
