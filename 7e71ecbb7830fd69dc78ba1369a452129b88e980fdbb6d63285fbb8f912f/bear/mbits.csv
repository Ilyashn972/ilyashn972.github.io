This was back in 1949. One day they suggested that we go hunting. But I was not keen on taking part in that activity. However, I let them talk me into it. We made sure that we rented out a cabin. We ensured that we had enough groceries. The people who suggested that we go hunting chickened out. That meant we were stuck in the cabin for four days without doing anything. The idea of going home without a bear or nothing to show that we at least attempted to hunt did not sit well with one of my friends. So they decided to bet on who would go out to kill the bear. Can you guess who the bear fell on? Me, the person who initially did not want to go hunting. I then took the gun and went hunting for the bear for hours. Suddenly, I heard something behind me. When I turned around, I saw a large bear staring at me. In as much as I was scared, I thought BINGO! Finally a bear I can finally take to my friends. I then attempted to open fire. But the gun would not go off. I then realized that the gun was not loaded. The only thing I could do is run for my life because bears are terrifying. Finally saw the cabin we rented. I started shouting, ""open the door"" to my friends. I went into the cabin. I made sure to shut the cabin door shut! My friends could not believe it.

I was the one who did, the person who was not interested in going there in the first place. I went out in the woods, for same time it was very quite with not activity.

One of his friends spoke up and said, 'they couldn't go back empty-handed because the locals would talk about them not bringing back a bear'. They decided to play a game of cards to decide who would go out and hunt the bear. The man picked the hunt card and he ventured out to hunt down a bear. When he came across a bear, he realised that his gun was unloaded so he ran towards the cabin and shouted for his friends to open the door to the cabin. He ran inside and told them that he did his part and his friends should do theirs.

During their younger years the city boys spent a lot of time visiting the farm and hunting for rabbits and squirrels. They all enjoyed the outdoor life. Long after they left school the city boys decided it would be a good idea to go to Canada to hunt bear. The farm boy wasn't at all keen, but was persuaded to go. The travelling took a long time by plane, canoe and a 500 mile walk to the north woods. They stayed in a cabin but decided they really didn't want to shoot a bear, so they spent time eating, sleeping and playing cards. However it was decided that one of them should shoot a bear because everyone back home would expect them to come back with a trophy. They drew cards and the farm boy got the highest card and went out with his gun. A very large brown bear rose up in front of him but although he took a shot, his gun wasn't loaded, so he ran back to the hut and yelled at his friend to open the door as he got there, he swerved to the right and the bear ran into the cabin.

The friends would often visit the narrator, who lived on a farm. They'd go hunting during those trips. Many years later, one of them suggested they fly to Canada and hunt down a bear. So, they make the trip, which includes a flight a long hike to their cabin in the woods, but by the time they get there, nobody is really in the mood to hunt bears (especially the narrator, who wasn't interested in hunting, anyway). However, after a few days of just staying in the cabin, they realise that they'd need some kind of evidence that they'd been hunting bears to bring back home, as they'd been bragging to all their other friends and families about it. So, they decide to draw cards in order to determine which one of the group had to go out and hunt the bear, alone; the narrator ends up having to do it. So, he takes his gun and makes his way out into the woods, where he eventually finds an enormous bear. Unfortunately, he had forgotten to load the gun before going out, and ends up running for his life as the bear chases him all the way back to the cabin. He gets his friends to open the door and, if I recall correctly, he seems to instead lure the bear inside while he stays outside, leaving his friends to kill and skin it.

We never left the cabin until one of them said that one of us has to go out and shoot a bear because lots of people know that we went bear hunting and it would be embarrassing to go back without a bear. So we had to draw straws and guess who got the short straw? me. The person who does not like to hunt and did not want even come on this trip. So off I went into the forest and came across the biggest bear that I have ever seen. This bear was so big that I have not even seen pictures of a bear so big.

All of them were of strong build and liked to help out on the farm and hunt squirrels and other small creatures. In 1949 they planned a bear hunt despite the boy from the farming background being indifferent to the trip. They flew up from Fort Worth into Canada with a view to canoeing up to the Great North Woods. They canoed some great distance and then backpacked up to a cabin that they had rented. The bulk of the time they played cards and did not go out at night. They felt that they had to have some thing to bring back and drew cards to decide who would go out and get the bear. The farm boy went out but had not loaded his rifle. He found a bear that chased him all the way back to the cabin. He yelled to them to open the cabin door and the bear rushed into the cabin.

Once they got there, they realised they didn't really want to go hunting at all. So they sat in the cabin, playing cards and having a nice time.

When they got to the destination of the cabin they would be staying for the next 4 nights they realised how spooky the woods were and all decided they was no longer keen on the idea of bear hunting so for three days then stayed in the cabin playing card games. Then on the last day they decided they would need to go bear hunting as they had told so many people and if they came back empty handed they wouldn't hear the end of it. They decided to cut the pack of cards and whoever got the highest number would go a bring a bear back from them to skin and show the people back at home. The friend who didn't want to go in the first place picked the highest card and went out looking for the bear with the gun. He was walking round and couldn't find anything but then he heard a noise and turned round and saw a big old bear the biggest he had ever seen. The friend tried to shot the bear but he realised he hadn't loaded the gun so he ran back to the cabin as fast as he could and the bear followed him.

His friends liked to hunt, including squirrel hunting, however he was not that interested in hunting. One of his friends suggested bear hunting in Canada. He went along with his friends for the experience. They got an aeroplane to Fort Wayne then another aeroplane to Canada, did some backpacking, used a canoe and they stayed in a cabin. They played card games etc. in that cabin. He and his friends changed their minds about bear hunting however one of his friends mentioned that if they did not hunt a bear then it would let down the expectations of other people. It was decided that whoever out of them got the highest card would be the one to bear hunt and the others would skin etc. the bear. He, the one out of them who did not want to bear hunt in the first place, got the highest card. He went with a gun to go bear hunting and after a while spotted a bear which was bigger than any he had seen in photos. He tried using that gun to shoot the bear however realised that the gun was not loaded. The bear was not happy that he was on their territory and quickly chased him. He got to the cabin and shouted at his friends to let him in. He eventually got away from the bear.",8.77,14.75,-3.18,1.95,-2.14,3.36,10.67,2.72,-2.28,0.68,0.39,7.03,4.03,2.47,6.82,-0.53,3.38,0.02,7.82,-3.4,-0.57,-4.68,1.53,0.16,-0.82,-1.84,1.06,-0.48,9.33,1.0,0.67,0.09,0.64,0.87,-1.06,-0.0,-4.21,-2.22,0.09,14.78,1.23,-2.55,1.53,-1.75,-1.87,0.0,1.72,3.7,-0.61,0.44,0.33,-0.3,0.64,-1.19,-0.75,1.83,0.72,-1.83,2.25,0.24,0.1,-0.85,-0.31,-3.4,-2.06,0.54,-1.03,-0.11,1.41,3.53,-3.48,1.31,1.62,-0.24,-0.96,5.12,4.08,10.8,-0.83,0.27,2.62,-2.12,2.08,4.22,-2.05,1.66,0.05,0.9,0.28,0.37,2.47,1.47,0.27,1.46,2.19,0.41,9.64,-0.31,-1.39,-0.14,0.03,-1.66,-0.48,0.43,-0.02,1.18,0.56,0.66,-0.4,-0.74,-1.16,-1.16,-2.9,0.47,-0.68,-1.45,-1.31,-0.06,-1.36,0.65,-0.62,-2.02

After college, one worked on a farm and the other two worked in the city. The farm worker, who'd been raised outdoors, wasn't really an outdoors type person. The other two loved the out doors and convinced their friend to go bear hunting with them. He wasn't that interested in hunting, but allowed himself to be convinced. The three friends took a plane from Fort Worth and travelled to a cabin in the north woods. The place was so spooky none of them felt like hunting, so they spent the majority of the time playing cards, eating and sleeping. They eventually decided that at least one of them should hunt and kill a bear so as not to face ridicule back home by returning empty-handed. So they cut cards to decide who would go and the farmworker drew the highest card. He went out, despite having had no desire to go on the hunting trip, and came across a large bear. He attempted to shoot it, but discovered he's forgotten to load his rifle. The bear then chased him back through the woods and all the while he was shouting to his friends to open the cabin door for him. As he approached the cabin he turned sharply and, as the door was open, the bear charged inside. He then shut the door behind the bear with his friends inside.

The man grew up on a farm. The other three, who were city boys, visited him on the farm. They went shooting rabbits and squirrels. The man wasn't that keen on hunting. It was part of rural life. His three friends loved it. After graduating university, and several years friendship, the group came up with a plan to go bear hunting. The man really wasn't keen on this. He was talked into it. The four of them went to Canada, to the North Woods to hunt their bear. The trip was long. It required a five hundred mile hike to get to the cabin they had booked. Once there they spent the first three days not hunting bears, but instead hanging out, playing cards and so on. On the penultimate night, they decided that they would look very silly if they returned with no bear. So they decided that one of them would go out the next day to hunt a bear. Then the other three would skin the bear and prepare it to take home, down south. The protagonist drew the short straw, and was the hunter. The next day the man went out and walked for a very long time looking for a bear to no avail. Eventually, he saw an enormous bear. He drew his gun. But then realized that he hadn't loaded it. So he couldn't shoot it. The bear was not happy so started to chase him. The man ran, as fast as he could, back to the cabin, with the bear in hot pursuit. As he approached the cabin he shouted for his friends to open the door. As he was nearly at the cabin, the man feigned left. The bear ran straight into the cabin. The man closed the door after him.

These friends all loved hunting but him being someone raised to farm he didn't much love hunting and all. So after school his friends decided to travel to Canada to go bear hunting. He didn't really like that idea but since he has been part of that group, they talked him into it. They got to Canada, landed on a lake took canoes and paddled about a day and half and backpacked for about five hundred miles too til they got to their cabin they had rented. The place was way spooky that they forgot they had come to hunt bears rather they played cards and this went on for about 3 days where one of them came up with the idea they really had to go hunt a bear because they couldn't go home empty handed. A decision was made about the person with the highest number of card going to hunt the bear and the remaining will butcher skin and pack him up. Obviously he was the guy who ended up with the highest number. He took an old turkey gun and set of the woods to hunt. He came across a big old looking bear and when he was ready to fire, the gun didn't because he had failed to load it back then. He had no other choice than to run, and by doing so the bear chased him all the way to the cabin where he screamed and shouted for them to let him in. Alas he got in and closed the door where he told his friends, there is your bear, you asked for it and i have done my part, now you guys go do your part.

They would hunt together on his property. Even though the boy wasn't keen he did it to fit in with the group. One day they all decided to take a trip to northern Canada to try to hunt a bear. The boy was still not keen but was pressured to go with his group. They flew out of Fort Wayne and headed to northern Canada together. They went to some woods where they had rented a spooky looking cabin. For days the boys could not bring themselves to go and look for the bear as they were scared by their surrounding. So they played cards and drank and slept. Before they were due to come home they were worried that people would make fun of them if they came back and had not brought a bear. So they drew cards and the boy telling the story unfortunately drew the short straw (so to speak). He went out into the woods and found a bear. The bear chased him all the way back to the cabin.

One of the friends grew up in the countryside on a farm and the other three lived in the city. The three city boys would often visit the friend at the farm as they enjoyed the outdoor life. The farm boy, although not excited by hunting, would take his friends hunting for squirrels and rabbits, to please them. When the three city boys suggested going on a bear hunt, the farm boy felt obliged. After flying to the forest and hiking 500 miles they reached a cabin to stay in. The forest looked spooky and neither of them wanted to risk hunting for a bear. After three or four days, they decided the shame of going home without a bear was too much. They drew cards to decide who would go and hunt the bear, with the other three required to butcher and skin the bear. The farm boy, who was not keen on the bear hunt in the first place, drew the highest card and unwillingly took the gun and went to find a bear. After a while he came upon the largest bear he had ever seen, in real life or photo. The bear was clearly not happy about him being on his territory and as he made towards him, the man tried to take a shot. However, the gun was not loaded and the man was forced to run for his life.

Although they met in college, they previously knew each other though from high school days. So, when they met in college, that is when they became close. This particular guy grew up on a farm, however, his three friends grew up in the city. So, at times, his friends would go to the farm to be with him where they would go rabbit hunting. Hunting brought a lot of joy to his friends since they were city guys, but to him, there was nothing extraordinary about it since he'd grown up on a farm. So, they continued to do this for several years until one of his friends suggested that they go bear hunting. Although he wasn't too hyped up about this idea, he decided to go along. So, they flew to Canada, ended up on some lake, then hiked into the mountains until they reached the cabin where they would be staying. While there though, since it was quite spooky in the woods, his friends chickened out of bear hunting. So, they stayed in the cabin for a couple of days playing cards, eating and sleeping, but still just not being in the mood to go hunting for bears out of fear. However, one of the friends then said that there was no way that they could return back home without a bear otherwise they would be ridiculed. So, they decided that one of them would go hunt for the bear and the others would skin the bear and cut it into pieces. However, although the story-teller was still not super-stoked about this idea, sadly the bet fell on him to go out in the woods to hunt for the bear. So, he did and while in the woods, he encountered the biggest and oldest bear that he had ever seen. Sadly, he realised at he was about to shoot the bear that he had forgotten to load the rifle. So he ran for his life back to the cabin screaming for his friends to open the door with the bear hot on his heels. As the door opened, he took a sharp left turn and the bear ran straight into the cabin. Upon which he declared to his friends that he had done his part and brought the bear for them to skin...which they could not deny. The story concludes by saying that although this happened thirty years ago, none of his friends have ever suggested going bear-hunting again.",9.26,-1.84,2.57,0.52,-2.04,2.56,0.39,0.15,-1.57,1.44,-0.25,6.13,3.19,3.53,5.55,-0.12,-4.39,4.23,3.78,-0.01,1.93,-0.28,-1.78,2.3,3.46,-2.53,1.39,-1.55,8.36,1.78,0.08,-0.2,0.6,2.72,-0.82,-0.51,-5.44,-2.41,0.31,2.17,2.31,2.96,0.54,-3.37,-2.3,-0.02,-1.19,3.3,0.07,1.23,-1.65,4.79,-0.08,-0.37,-0.21,2.78,8.27,0.69,2.89,3.17,1.78,0.7,2.25,-1.6,-0.98,0.73,-0.65,-1.01,0.56,-0.11,1.32,2.64,2.68,0.28,-0.76,2.0,0.86,9.67,1.0,-0.84,0.39,0.0,0.47,1.93,-1.22,1.68,0.73,0.67,0.19,2.87,-0.24,1.04,-1.0,1.16,4.86,-1.48,1.11,-0.28,-0.59,0.4,0.44,-2.35,-0.6,-0.16,0.63,2.24,2.75,1.18,-0.37,-0.31,-0.22,9.77,6.61,2.4,-0.59,3.7,-0.56,-1.95,7.09,1.11,-0.21,0.21
656013477ede6fae3cc2728b,133.53,0.06,"A little before 1949, this man had three buddies he got close to in college. Before, he was acquainted with them because they all went to separate high schools but were all athletes who saw each other in passing. Anyway, they got close in college and the man lived on the farm and the other three lived in the city. Because of this, the three would love to come to the farm and help the man do chores or do ""macho"" stuff like hunting. They liked hunting squirrels and small things, but the man wasn't as interested because this was his regular life and it wasn't exciting. He went along with it because he wanted to be part of the group though. Later on, maybe a couple of years, the three friends wanted to go on a hunting trip to hunt bear, and although the man wasn't that interested now either, he agreed to go for the same reason as before. So, they all went to the northern woods where one of the friends rented a cabin. On the journey, they encounter scary bears and the woods itself was scary, had to paddle for forever in kayaks, and when they got the cabin eventually they all decided to stay inside because they were spooked. Inside they played card games and stuff, and near the end of the 3-4 day trip, they decided that because they told everyone back at home they'd catch a bear, then they needed to bring a bear back. They played a game to decide who would go out and shoot the bear and bring it back for the others to skin and pack. Funnily, the farmer man who didn't even want to go in the first place got the short end of the stick. He got a gun and went out though, as a man of his word. He happened to come across a bear, but it was a HUGE bear. Bigger than anything the man's seen or heard of. He tried to shoot it, but he realized he didn't load the gun. So, the only thing he could do was run because now he's angered the bear. He ran with the bear hot on his heels and went back to the cabin screaming for his three friends to open the door. They opened the door, he went inside, but the bear ended up following him in too. The man told his friends 'alright, I brought the bear to you guys to skin and pack'. It was a funny story and years later, his friends never invited him out to hunt again but knew he was a man of his word.",8.98,6.78,1.3,1.76,-3.75,3.37,8.61,1.47,-2.75,0.86,-0.42,6.21,5.29,8.58,7.06,-0.22,3.84,0.69,7.96,-0.29,3.68,-1.31,6.29,4.1,-0.23,-0.39,0.89,0.54,2.13,1.77,-0.14,-0.44,-0.68,0.27,-2.09,-0.78,-7.55,-1.56,0.1,-2.74,0.72,-0.71,2.16,-0.66,-1.45,-1.21,-2.91,7.16,0.73,1.51,-1.13,4.27,0.04,-0.98,-0.86,2.84,3.79,1.81,2.89,0.24,0.02,-2.01,0.16,-0.92,-0.51,0.15,0.01,0.69,0.38,-1.37,4.77,0.36,1.17,-1.39,0.05,2.79,0.82,8.27,0.76,0.04,3.08,-0.42,2.61,2.48,-1.95,0.13,0.93,1.92,0.34,-0.5,3.47,0.8,0.48,1.3,3.09,-0.7,0.67,-0.41,1.81,-0.23,1.26,-2.08,-0.23,-0.14,0.43,1.52,2.73,-0.58,-0.87,1.35,-1.2,-0.46,0.05,2.59,-0.58,4.01,-0.55,-0.98,0.43,6.48,-1.23,3.0

I didn't like the idea but had to go along because my friends wanted to go hunting. We left Fort Wayne and went further north into the northern forests of Canada. We reached a lake and took canoes out until we couldn't go further. We then hiked for 500 miles until we reached our cabin. We didn't want to hunt a bear, so we stayed in the cabin for four or five days, playing cards. After four or five days, one of the boys said we need to hunt a bear or the people we told back home would laugh at us. So we decided whoever pulled the highest card would have to hunt the bear.

So instead of bear hunting the 4 guys decide to stay in the cabin and play card games for 4 days. They did not go outside at nighttime and hunkered down in the cabin. After 3-4 days though someone says ""people back home are going to real mean to us if we don't come back with a bear, because they all know that were going bear hunting out in the forest"". So the group of friends decide that they need to get a bear. But because none of them want to they play a card game for it. The loser would have to get the bear and the winners would have to skin butcher and bag the bear meat. Our main character the one that didnt even want to be there in the first place loses and has to go hunt a bear. So he sets out to find a bear in the forest. He spends hours out there looking for this bear but cant find anything. Eventually he turns around and sees a huge bear directly behind him. A bear bigger than any bear he has ever seen before even in pictures. So he immediately tries to shoot the bear, but he forgot to load his gun. So in panic the only thing he can do is run. He starts running as fast as he could. He recalls being a fast runner in the past but the old bear is still gaining on him. As he is getting closer to the cabin where everyone else is he yells ""OPEN THE DOOR, OPEN DOOR"". The other guys open the door for him and he rushes inside and close the door behind him locking the bear out and says, ""Well I brought you guys the bear, you better get to skinning"". After 30 years the 3 guys still say he completed his task of bringing a bear back. But for some reason they never invited him to go hunting again.",6.89,-2.95,1.5,-1.31,2.77,3.05,-4.1,-1.04,-1.76,2.69,0.46,7.14,2.24,3.56,0.68,-1.11,-0.35,2.39,5.46,0.94,1.64,-3.92,0.01,2.76,0.65,-1.57,1.42,2.47,8.45,1.71,-0.26,6.43,0.38,0.36,0.03,0.08,-2.99,-1.41,0.34,-3.67,1.57,-0.81,2.28,-1.21,-2.59,3.27,7.63,4.35,0.16,1.66,-1.25,3.7,0.5,-1.07,-0.5,3.46,4.24,1.73,3.1,0.3,0.49,-2.36,0.04,-1.58,8.84,2.61,1.12,-1.26,0.57,-0.14,-1.11,3.51,1.56,-0.9,-1.38,4.05,0.56,18.12,-0.51,-0.68,4.29,-0.86,0.98,2.29,-0.72,4.01,2.33,0.45,1.04,1.03,4.16,1.83,0.83,1.13,5.11,-1.44,-0.68,-0.74,1.53,-0.31,0.11,7.78,1.12,-0.07,-1.14,3.9,6.84,-1.31,-2.06,0.87,-2.05,-0.98,-3.47,2.3,-1.06,2.5,-0.4,-2.7,5.6,7.1,0.94,2.03
5bf1c9d332cb3b0001f6f1c3,161.44,0.1,I knew some acquaintances and then when I went to a new school they were then also there and we got to being good friends. We were all on the same athletics team. The other 3 lived in the city however I was brought up on a farm and they liked to come up to the farm to help with chores and hunt. As we grew up we were talking one day and someone mentioned about going bear hunting however I really didn’t want to go. I also didn’t want to disappoint the group so I agreed to go even through I didn’t want to. So we took a flight to the canal where we then had to use canoes to get to the bottom of the mountain which seemed to take forever. Once we got to the mountain we then had to walk what felt like 5 days to get to the cabin. Once we got to the cabin we realised how scary the place was so we decided to stay inside and not go out so we stayed in the cabin playing cards. Towards the end of the break we realised if we didn’t take a bear home with us we would be talked about unkindly so we decided that we would cut cards and whoever got the highest would be the one to go get a bear and the remaining 3 would be the ones to skin the bear ready to take home. Unluckily it was me who got the highest card so I went out in the scary woods looking for a bear. I finally found the biggest bear I had ever seen ( even in a photo!) I shot the gun but it didn’t go off as it hadn’t been loaded. So I ran and ran back towards the cabin. When the cabin was in sight I shouted “open the door” when the door opened I moved to the left and the bear ran in! I told the rest id done my bit! Looking back now the group all agree that I did infact do my bit!,10.96,-2.14,-2.51,1.28,1.33,2.41,0.71,-0.83,-0.17,4.36,1.04,4.75,4.78,3.01,8.65,-0.51,3.45,-1.75,4.44,-1.81,-1.87,-3.75,3.71,1.66,0.76,-2.94,1.04,0.95,4.56,1.9,-1.26,-0.52,0.58,0.74,-1.03,-0.16,-2.86,-2.13,0.28,3.4,2.24,0.97,3.66,0.31,-2.17,1.5,2.75,4.4,0.67,3.37,-0.69,4.68,1.04,-0.85,-1.14,4.11,7.2,0.1,1.95,-0.07,0.25,-1.35,-0.26,-0.04,-0.33,0.62,0.16,0.53,5.08,1.18,2.96,3.99,1.4,-0.32,-0.21,7.36,5.77,9.02,1.14,-0.99,-0.05,0.86,1.91,2.28,-0.86,1.43,-0.31,1.12,0.08,1.06,3.6,2.47,1.01,1.21,2.4,-2.39,0.78,0.01,-0.46,-0.0,0.37,-2.45,-0.34,-0.05,-0.06,4.52,4.87,-0.69,-1.81,-0.42,0.92,8.52,7.01,1.92,-0.46,3.82,-0.86,0.39,0.95,9.37,-1.79,-2.94

This place was spooky, we didn't want to hunt the bear once we got there, so for about 3 or 4 days we just sat around the cabin playing cards and stuff. We said we had to hunt the bear though as the people at home would give us a hard time if we didn't come home with a bear as many people knew we went out hunting for a bear. So we agreed that whoever got a high card would have to go out and find the bear. Of course it was me who had to go and hunt the bear while the fellas would skin and pack the bear. For hours I was searching in the forest for the bear, then I heard a noise and it was behind me. The biggest bear I have ever seen, not even the pictures had them this big.

5c2ebf3e626018000134986f,185.48,0.09,"This is a story about me and three of my friends. We knew each other back in 1949. At one point we all attended the same high school. We were athletes on the school team. All the guys were the macho type. They used to love to go hunting. Reluctantly I would go with them. They liked hunting squirrel and other small animals. I didn't have much interest in hunting. I grew up on a farm. I was used to these activities. I was no longer excited by them. After a number of hunting trips the other guys suggested we all fly to Canada. They wanted to try to hunt a bear. Again I wasn't particularly keen to do this. I agreed to go anyway. We flew over to Canada out of Fort Wayne. When we landed we had to paddle in canoes for what seemed like two days. Once back on land we had to trek for a further 500 miles. The guys had rented a cabin in the woods. We had supplies for a few nights. The strange thing is, we didn't go hunting. We just stayed in the cabin, eating, sleeping and playing cards. The woods were really spooky up there. It seemed that the guys had lost all interest in hunting a bear. So we just stayed in the cabin. Towards to the end of our stay one of the guys said we're going to look stupid if we don't come back with a bear. So we decided to draw cards to see who would venture into the woods to kill the bear. The other guys would have the job of skinning and cutting the meat. We drew our cards. Can you believe it? The guy who didn't want to go in the first place drew the bear card. So out I went into the spooky woods. I looked for a bear. Suddenly I looked up and saw a bear. It was huge. I've never even seen a picture of a bear so big. Here was one starring right at me. I whipped up the shotgun. I pulled the trigger. But nothing happened. Like a complete turkey I had only forgot to load the damn thing. That bear was furious. He did not want me on his turf.

603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,185.5,0.09,"This is a story about some college friends. I got acquainted with some guys in college. These guys loved to hunt... rabbits and deers and things. I am not the hunting type, but I usually went with them and entertained those ideas. Eventually, they started talking about hunting a bear, and finally convinced me to go with them. I was totally talked into going, even though I did not want to. Well, we travelled up north canada into some woods to hunt bears. The group of us canoed up into the woods as far as we could go, and then backpacked the ret of the way... what felt like 500 miles... to a cabin that they rented. It was a really spooky place, and when we were there no one felt like actually going out and hunting. We ended up sleeping, eating and playing cards for three or four days. On the fourth or fifth day, one guy piped up and said that we better not go home empty handed when everyone knew that we were coming to hunt some bears. If we went home empty handed we would never hear the end of it. So we all decided that we would draw cards, and whoever got the highest would go out and hunt the bear, and the others would skin it and cut it into chunks to take home. Guess who drew the highest card... the guy who DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO BE THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE. But I had agreed to play the game. So I took the gun and went out. It felt like I had walked for hours and hours in those woods and found nothing. Eventually, I heard a noice behind me, I turned and saw the biggest bear I had ever seen. I had never even seen a bear that big in a PICTURE. And that old bear was not happy that I was in his territory. The only thing I could do was turn around and run run run, but that old bear was fast. He was right on my tail. When the cabin was in sight I started yelling ""Open the door, open the door"", with the bear hot on my tail. The guys opened the door, but before going in I quickly turned to the left, but the bear went straight inside. I closed the door and shouted THERE YOU HAVE YOUR BEAR.

We knew each other as we took part in sporting events. When we joined Graduate school, we found out we were all in the same school and got to know each other better. I grew up in a farm and from a village while the other three were from the city. We used to go hunting while we were free and they used to come to my farm and hunt rabbits and squirrels. I was not very interested as it was not new for me, but they really enjoyed it. Once they mentioned they were all done with rabbit hunting and we should go bear hunting. I was not hepped up about it, but since I was part of the group I let them talk me into it. So we flew out of the airport from Fort Wayne into some part of Canada and landed on a lake. From there, we went hiking for about 500 miles into the north woods. We had to reach a cabin where we would stay. We reached the cabin and it was a spooky place. We did not go bear hunting and all for three days was play cards and drink. After 3 days one of the friends said we need to go bear hunting as many people from our place knew we had gone to hunt a bear and if we returned empty handed it would not be good for us. so we need to get a bear and either hunt it or take one back to our place. I was not interested to go. It was decided to play a game of cards and whoever had the highest number at the end of the game would go to hunt the bear and the other three will stay and do the skinning and cutting the meat so it can be taken back with us. So the card game started and guess who had the highest card! the one who was least interested in hunting the bear. Yes, then I picked up a gun and left to hunt the bear on my own. I kept walking but there was nothing to be found, after quite a while, I heard a noise, when I went to check I saw the biggest old bear I had ever seen in my life. It did not look happy to see me in its territory. I took out the gun, aimed to shoot, when I pressed the trigger nothing happened, I realised the gun was not loaded and made a run for it. I ran as hard as I could, but the bear was closing in on my heels, after coming out of the woods, I could see the cabin and I shouted OPEN THE DOOR!

We found out that we were in the same school. The four of us became good friends. Now I’m a farm boy. I grew up on a farm. The other three were city guys. They’d come over to help out at the farm. Although I didn’t enjoy it much, I went along with them to be with the group. They loved hunting rabbits. I’d join them. One day they mentioned that they wanted to hunt a bear up in Canada. I wasn’t really thrilled at the idea. I had no real reason as to why we couldn’t go. So we packed up and make our way to Canada. We landed in the water. We then canoed as far as we could go. When we got to land, we had to walk 500 miles it seemed like. When we got to the cabin, the forest was spooky. None of the guys wanted to venture outside. We stayed there for three or four days. We played cards. We ate. We slept. One of the guys mentioned that we needed to bring a bear back since a lot of people knew we were coming to hunt bears. Now no one was looking to be the guy that went out in the spooky woods trying to hunt a bear. So me being the farmer went out into the woods. The others were going to skin the bear and prep it to take back with us. When I went outside, I saw the biggest bear anyone’s ever seen. I turned around and started back towards the cabin. I thought I was fast. The bear was gaining. As I got close to the cabin I started yelling OPEN THE DOOR, OPEN THE DOOR. When the guys opened the door, I took a quick left. I quickly shut the door behind the bear. I shouted out, SKIN THE BEAR, I’LL GO FIND US ANOTHER ONE. Now this was 30 years ago. Can you imagine that not one of the guys asked me to go hunting with them since then?",14.56,13.73,-4.5,-0.93,-1.53,5.45,-4.91,-1.43,1.81,6.8,1.08,6.73,2.59,4.1,7.2,-0.14,0.5,-0.13,8.18,-2.45,-0.45,-3.1,5.85,2.05,1.09,-1.28,1.73,-1.18,8.3,2.17,-2.22,6.01,-0.04,1.01,-2.39,-0.49,-4.18,-1.24,0.41,-1.96,2.78,2.73,3.42,0.94,-1.92,3.46,9.54,5.14,0.04,1.61,-2.23,7.04,-0.02,-0.98,-0.85,1.37,10.02,3.54,3.62,3.44,1.76,-1.11,0.36,1.2,3.09,0.17,0.19,-0.22,3.17,0.34,2.9,1.78,5.83,-0.98,1.17,-4.91,-0.13,8.38,3.19,1.11,0.86,-2.08,1.18,1.01,0.24,-0.14,0.42,0.51,0.68,0.79,0.19,-1.83,-2.48,-0.09,-0.39,-0.72,0.88,-0.5,-1.29,0.91,0.83,1.75,0.02,2.31,-0.56,3.65,7.84,1.14,-1.76,-0.41,-1.19,10.43,2.55,3.39,-1.21,0.34,0.56,10.53,7.39,0.36,5.73,2.75

After high school, they found themselves attending the same college and became friends. He was from the farm while the other three were from the city. Over the years, they came down to the farm to do some hunting. The man wasn't really a big fan of hunting because he grew up outdoors, but to the rest of them, it was a lot of fun. One day, the three friends brought a suggestion to go bear hunting in Canada. The man did not want to but he let them talk him into it. They packed up, took a flight up to Canada. They landed on a lake, paddled in a canoe for what seemed like a day and a half, and then hiked what seemed like 500 miles before arriving at a cabin in the woods that they had rented. Upon settling down in the cabin, they all decided that they weren't exactly hyped up about going bear hunting. So for the next three or four days, they stayed indoors, played card games, and ate. On the third or fourth day, one of them brought it up that they had to get a bear so as not to disappoint the people waiting for them back at home. To decide who goes out to hunt the bear, they drew cards. The person with the highest card had to go hunt the bear, while the others would skin it and prepare it for travel. After they drew cards, it turned out it was the man who did not even want to go in the first place that got the highest card. He took the old gun and set out. After what seemed like hours, he heard a growl behind and looked back to see the biggest bear he had ever seen in his life. He picked up the gun and fired, but nothing happened. Turned out he had forgotten to load the gun. He turned on his heels and started running as fast as he could, with the bear on his heels. When he got in sight of the cabin, he started shouting for them to open the door. The door opened, but instead of going in, he took a left around the cabin, while the bear went straight inside. He quickly closed the cabin door and told his friends that he had brought the bear, it was their turn to skin it. Eventually, they agreed that he actually played his part. Although this happened 30 years ago, they never asked him to go hunting since that day.",8.11,-3.85,1.18,0.19,0.51,4.06,8.39,2.94,-1.47,3.77,1.99,7.88,2.38,1.7,6.57,0.52,-5.52,0.55,9.42,2.99,2.63,-0.18,0.24,3.1,0.69,-1.1,2.0,-2.81,9.89,2.26,-0.96,0.38,5.22,1.91,-1.69,-0.37,-4.64,-1.5,0.58,3.23,3.29,4.68,2.62,5.07,-3.52,1.52,8.27,7.73,0.23,0.03,0.17,-1.88,0.93,-0.43,-0.06,4.15,6.94,3.09,4.21,3.92,-1.58,-1.79,0.09,-5.75,-1.28,0.55,0.04,-1.09,0.94,-0.64,1.81,0.43,0.51,-0.74,-0.19,5.52,4.18,8.83,1.37,-0.64,4.47,-2.53,5.82,3.15,-0.87,3.77,-1.24,1.79,0.8,1.06,0.48,2.89,0.71,1.85,4.88,-1.03,0.21,-0.55,-1.26,0.24,0.04,-1.03,-0.11,0.03,0.56,6.66,3.31,-0.38,-1.93,0.53,2.58,7.63,6.07,3.9,-0.9,3.6,-0.47,-0.19,6.69,7.8,-0.96,6.6

Their paths had crossed in the past. Despite attending different schools, they had all been athletic. So they had become acquainted. They became good friends after graduation. When they then attended the same school. The author had lived on a farm. But the other three were from the city. The friends used to meet up on the farm to hunt for rabbits and squirrels. The city boys used to enjoy it more than the author. He'd been brought up on the farm. So it was the norm for him. And he didn't get excited by it. This went on for quite a few years. Until one day the young men decided that they would like to go bear hunting in Canada. Whilst the idea didn't really appeal to the author. He was part of the group. And got talked into going along with them. He was concerned that he may be hunted by the bear rather than the other way round. They took an aeroplane. And landed on a lake. It was still a long way to their destination. And they had to hike and use canoes to get there. They reached their cabin. But the author was still apprehensive about the expedition. And described it as spooky. In fact, none of the men wanted to go out into the woods. So they stayed in the cabin for several days. They had taken groceries with them. And played cards. They then discussed the shame of returning home having not hunted a bear. As they had told too many people about it. And knew that there was an expectation. They used the cards to determine who was going to go out to hunt the bear. The person who drew the high card would be the one to go. Unfortunately for the author, it was him. Typical as he was the one that didn't want to be there in the first place. He grabbed his and went into the woods. There was a noise. And he turned around to face the biggest bear ever. He aimed at it with his gun. Then realised he had forgotten to load it. The bear was angry. And started to chase him. Luckily, despite the bear being on his heels, he reached the cabin. And shouted for the others to open the door. He then made a quick left turn. But the bear turned right. Once safely inside the cabin, the author then said to his friends ""There he is. You skin him and I'll go and get another one!"" Thirty years had elapsed.

We did all meet up as we attended the same college. The other 3 guys we all from the city, but I was from a rural farm. They all used to enjoy visiting the farm to help out as they were all quite physical. They also like to go hunting for rabbits and the like. Although, even growing up on a farm I did not like hunting. We would often meet up. But after several years one of the guys said about going bear hunting. Even thought this was not something I liked, I agreed to go as we are all part of the group and I didn't have a good excuse. So they planned a trip to the north woods in Canada, we flew up from Fort Wayne and landed on a lake. We hired some canoes to paddle as far as wee could, seemed like over a day. We then left the canoes and had a long hike to an old cabin they had rented. It seems like we must have hiked hundreds of miles. We settled into the cabin but didn't like the look of the woods, we all found it a bit spooky. So much that we would not go outside at night. We just chatted and played cards for several days. When it got near to the time of leaving, one of the guys thought we would be embarrassed not returning with a bear. As a group we decided to cut a deck of cards to decide who would hunt for a bear before I return. As you might guess I was the one who drew the high card, the one who didn't like hunting. I had to follow through, so it was agreed I would hunt the bear and the rest would skin and butcher the bear. I wen out with the old rifle to hunt a bear, it seemed like I wasn't going to find one. But I heard a noise and turned around to see a huge bear, the biggest bear I had seen even in pictures. I raised the rifle , aimed at the bear and pulled the trigger. Nothing, I had forgotten to load the rifle. The bear decided it was going to defend its territory and started towards me, I just turned and ran as fast as I could towards the cabin. Even though in good shape the bear was gaining. Finally the cabin was inside, I shouted for help, called for them to open the door. The bear was almost on me as a reached the door. But rather than go in i swerved to the left of the door, the bear couldn't stop and ran straight into the cabin. I quickly closed the door and called to the guys, over to you, I have hunted the bear, now it is your turn to process the bear. This is what happened over 30 years ago.

They were 3 macho men, and we all had been athletes. After a few years, one of them suggested that we go up to Canada to go squirrel and rabbit hunting. I didn't really like hunting, but I had done everything with that group, so I left them talk me into it. One of them eventually suggested we go bear hunting instead, so we took a plane up to Fort Wayne, and hiked for a day and a half up to a cabin. The woods were really spooky, and all the others suddenly didn't feel like going bear hunting either, like me. So for a few days we waited in the cabin, eating, sleeping, playing cards, until one of us realised that too many people knew we had gone back bear hunting, so we needed to head back with a bear. They decided, and I agreed, that they would cut cards to decide which one of us would go out, get a bear, and bring it back for the rest to skin and pack so we can take it home. And WHO WOULD HAVE GUESSED, but it was the guy who didn't even want to go hunting in the first place. But I had agreed to this process. So I took our shotgun, went out and walked for hours but didn't find anything, when suddenly I heard a noise, and turned to see the biggest old bear I have ever seen. I aimed my gun and shot it at it, but then realised I had forgotten to load it! But the bear didn't like having me in its territory, so it came after me. I turned and ran. I thought I was pretty fast, but the old bear was gaining on me. I ran as fast as I could back to the cabin, yelling ""OPEN THE DOOR, OPEN THE DOOR"". They opened the door to the cabin, and at the last moment I turned left, the bear turned right into the cabin, and I turned and shut the door. I yelled ""OK I FOUND A BEAR NOW YOU GUYS SKIN AND PACK IT, I WILL GO FIND ANOTHER ONE"".

Actually I met them before that, we became friends after we all... went to school at the same place. Previous to that during high school we'd all been school athletes at different schools, and so we were acquainted. But then after graduation after we all enrolled in school, we found that the four of us were all now attending the same school, and became quite good friends. I was the kid from the farm, the other three guys all lived in the city.
