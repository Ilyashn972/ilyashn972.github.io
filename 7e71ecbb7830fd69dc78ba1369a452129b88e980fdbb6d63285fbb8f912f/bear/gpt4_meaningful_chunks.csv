"(18, 19)",Then we'd go rabbit hunting and squirrel hunting and things of that nature. I never really enjoyed hunting.,I didn't enjoy hunting like they did
"(20, 23)","Uh ... being born and raised on the farm I was used to the outdoors, wasn't all that exciting to me. But these guys got a big kick out of it, so I'd go along just to be one of the group.","Hunting wasn't exciting for me, but I joined in"
"(24, 27)","Things went on, we did this for several years, they were always coming out to the farm, and hunting.",We continued this tradition for years
"(28, 29)","After we'd been acquainted for several years, one of them got the idea they'd like to go bear hunting up in Canada.",They wanted to go bear hunting in Canada

"(35, 37)","I don't care anything really much about hunting period, let alone bear hunting. Be about my luck the bear would wind up hunting me.","I wasn't interested in hunting, especially bears"
"(38, 39)","But as I said, I left them talk me into it.",They convinced me to go on the trip
"(40, 45)","So we took an airplane out of Fort Wayne, and we flew way up into Canada some place, and we landed on a lake, and then we rented canoes, and paddled for another ... day and a half it seemed to me, 'till we got way up in the north woods.",We flew to Canada and journeyed deep into the woods
"(46, 48)","Then after we ... went as far as we could in the canoes, then we had to backpack for another ... five hundred miles I thought, 'till we got to this cabin that they had rented way up there in the north woods.",The trek to the cabin was long and arduous
"(49, 52)","And after I got there, I was even more apprehensive than I had been even before we started, 'cause I didn't really need any part of that. That was pretty spooky looking territory, let me tell you.",The remote cabin made me apprehensive
"(53, 55)","So we got up there, and got set up in the cabin, and ... got our groceries stored and everything.",We settled into the cabin in the spooky woods
"(56, 57)",And after we got to discussing it those guys weren't any more hot about going out in those woods and looking for a bear than I was.,None of us were eager to hunt bears
"(58, 61)","We sat around there for three or four days, played cards, and ate, and slept,",We spent days playing cards and relaxing
"(62, 64)",and we just couldn't ... no one was in the mood to go out and hunt bear 'cause that's just a plain old spooky looking place.,The mood to hunt bears was absent
"(65, 66)","We never ventured outside at night, we stayed right there in the old cabin.","We stayed in at night, avoiding the dark woods"
"(67, 74)","Well after we'd been there for three or four days, we got to talking it over, and somebody said “Hey, if we don't go out and hunt some bear ... we've got to find a bear to take back home with us, or we're really going to get a bad time from the rest of the people, 'cause too many people know we'd gone bear hunting, and if we come home skunked with no bear they're really going to give us a bad time.”",We realized we needed a bear to avoid ridicule
"(75, 79)","Soo ... no one wanted to go out, so we all decided that we'd cut the cards. Whoever got the high card ... would go out and get a bear, and the rest of them would skin him butcher him and pack him back down, so we could take him home with us.",We drew cards to decide who would hunt a bear
"(80, 84)","So you know who YOU KNOW WHO got the high card, the guy that didn't even want to be there in the first place. But I had agreed to play the game ... So ... I took the old gun, and I go out bear hunting.","I, the reluctant one, drew the high card for hunting"
"(85, 87)","I didn't like this at all. I'm walking out there in the woods for hours it seems like, and I just wasn't seeing any bears or anything,","I went into the woods, not enjoying the hunt"
"(88, 91)","and finally I heard a noise, and I turned around, and there was the biggest old bear I'd ever seen in my life, I'd never even seen a PICTURE of one THAT big.",I encountered a huge bear unexpectedly
"(92, 95)","I whipped up the gun, and pulled the trigger, and nothing happened. I'd forgot to LOAD that turkey.",My gun was unloaded when I tried to shoot
"(96, 98)","Well he had ... he just had no desires to have me in his territory, and he made for me.",The bear chased me as I ran for the cabin
"(99, 104)","Well there was nothing for me to do but run, and I turned around, I ran as hard as I could go, and I thought I used to be pretty fast, but that old bear, man he was gaining,",I sprinted back with the bear close behind
"(105, 109)","he was just right on my heels ... And when I got within sight of that cabin I started yelling “OPEN THE DOOR, OPEN THE DOOR!” Man I was whipping down there just as hard as I could go, and that old bear right on my tail,",I yelled for the door as the bear pursued me
"(110, 113)","and they opened the door, and I got right to the cabin door, I made a quick turn to the left, and that old bear went right on in.",The bear entered the cabin as I dodged away
"(114, 118)","I just reached back, and pulled the door shut, and said “THERE HE IS FELLOWS, YOU SKIN HIM, I'LL GO GET ANOTHER ONE!”",I trapped the bear inside and offered to get another
"(119, 122)","Now all this happened thirty years ago, and all my buddies agreed ... that I lived up to my commitment. But can you BELIEVE, they haven't asked me to go hunting one time since that day.","That was thirty years ago, and no more hunting invites"
