They had to go across a lake to get to the woods and had to walk what felt like five hundred miles to get to their cabin. The walk was scary so it put them off wanting to go hunting for bears as they were all spooked out. So for a few days they just stayed in the cabin together and played cards. Then they realised that if they didn't bring back a bear people wouldn't believe them and would probably make fun of them. So they played the high cards game and who ever picked the highest card had to go and hunt the bear alone and bring it back to the cabin dead. The others would skin the bear and prepare it to take back as a trophy. The story teller got the high card so had to go out and hunt. He went out and took a gun, found a bear bigger than he'd even seen on pictures. He went to shoot it and realised that he hadn't loaded the gun so ran instead. He got back to the cabin just in time and slammed the door. They didn't go bear hunting again.",1218,0.06,"In 1949, they all came together attending the same educational institution where they struck up a friendship. His home was a rural farmstead while they resided in an urban setting regularly making trips to see him at the farm with a fondness for hunting activities which he, however, did not share. They conceived a plan to venture to Canada for a bear hunting expedition thus, they made the journey. Crossing a lake was necessary to reach the forest and they trekked a distance that seemed to span five hundred miles to their lodge. The trek was filled with trepidation which dampened their enthusiasm for the bear hunt leaving them thoroughly unnerved. Consequently, they spent several days confined to the lodge engaging in card games. Eventually, they recognized that without a bear, their story might not be believed and they risked being the subject of ridicule. Hence, they resorted to the high card game where the one drawing the highest card was tasked with the solitary bear hunt and had the duty of returning with the bear deceased. The rest would undertake the skinning of the bear and ready it to be brought back as proof of their conquest. The narrator drew the highest card and thus was obligated to embark on the hunt. Armed with a firearm, he set out and encountered a bear of unprecedented size compared to any he had seen in images. He aimed to fire at it only to realize the firearm was not loaded prompting him to flee instead. He managed to return to the lodge in the nick of time hastily securing the entrance behind him.

We wanted to bring something back though so it didn’t look like we skunked out. Guess who it was that ended up going hunting, it was me. My friends said that they would skin tans pack the bear when I brought it back. I went out to find one and saw it. It was THE BIGGEST bear I had ever seen, even bigger than ones I had seen in photos.

Among them, one friend was raised on a rural farm, while the remaining trio resided in an urban environment. The urban trio frequently made trips to the farm to indulge in the pleasures of rural life. The country-raised friend, who wasn't particularly thrilled by the hunt, would nonetheless guide his pals in tracking down squirrels and rabbits to cater to their interests. Compelled by a sense of duty, the country friend acquiesced when his urban counterparts proposed a bear hunting expedition. They journeyed by air to the forest and trekked a distance of 500 miles before arriving at a cabin for their stay. The forest exuded an eerie aura, and all of them were hesitant to venture into bear hunting. After spending several days, they concluded that the embarrassment of returning bearless outweighed their fears. They resorted to drawing lots to select the individual who would undertake the bear hunt, while the rest would be tasked with the bear's butchery and skinning. The farm-raised friend, initially reluctant about the hunt, ended up drawing the highest lot and begrudgingly took up arms to seek out a bear. Eventually, he encountered a bear of unprecedented size, unlike any he had seen in person or in images. The bear, clearly agitated by the intrusion into its domain, advanced towards him, prompting the man to attempt a shot. Alas, the firearm was not primed, leaving the man with no choice but to flee for his survival. He neared the cabin with the bear swiftly closing the distance behind him. He cried out to his companions to unlatch the cabin door. In a last-ditch turn, he witnessed the bear barging into the cabin. The man quipped, ""I've delivered the bear as you wished. Now, I'll head back out to track down another."" Predictably, the urban friends never again pressed the country friend to join them in any future hunts.",1969,0.05507915147886085

Although they met in college, they previously knew each other though from high school days. So, when they met in college, that is when they became close. This particular guy grew up on a farm, however, his three friends grew up in the city. So, at times, his friends would go to the farm to be with him where they would go rabbit hunting. Hunting brought a lot of joy to his friends since they were city guys, but to him, there was nothing extraordinary about it since he'd grown up on a farm. So, they continued to do this for several years until one of his friends suggested that they go bear hunting. Although he wasn't too hyped up about this idea, he decided to go along. So, they flew to Canada, ended up on some lake, then hiked into the mountains until they reached the cabin where they would be staying. While there though, since it was quite spooky in the woods, his friends chickened out of bear hunting. So, they stayed in the cabin for a couple of days playing cards, eating and sleeping, but still just not being in the mood to go hunting for bears out of fear. However, one of the friends then said that there was no way that they could return back home without a bear otherwise they would be ridiculed. So, they decided that one of them would go hunt for the bear and the others would skin the bear and cut it into pieces. However, although the story-teller was still not super-stoked about this idea, sadly the bet fell on him to go out in the woods to hunt for the bear. So, he did and while in the woods, he encountered the biggest and oldest bear that he had ever seen. Sadly, he realised at he was about to shoot the bear that he had forgotten to load the rifle. So he ran for his life back to the cabin screaming for his friends to open the door with the bear hot on his heels. As the door opened, he took a sharp left turn and the bear ran straight into the cabin. Upon which he declared to his friends that he had done his part and brought the bear for them to skin...which they could not deny. The story concludes by saying that although this happened thirty years ago, none of his friends have ever suggested going bear-hunting again.",2252,0.06,"This narrative centers on a man and his trio of college buddies who eventually formed a bond. Despite their college acquaintance, they had actually known one another from their high school years. It was during their college years that their friendship truly deepened. The main character was raised on a farm, in contrast to his three friends who were city dwellers. Occasionally, his city friends would visit him at the farm to engage in rabbit hunting together. The hunting excursions were thrilling for his urban friends, yet for him, it was commonplace due to his rural upbringing. They maintained this tradition for years until one friend proposed they try bear hunting. He wasn't particularly excited about the proposal, but he agreed to participate. Thus, they journeyed to Canada, found themselves beside a lake, trekked into the mountains, and arrived at the cabin they'd be staying in. However, once surrounded by the eerie forest, his friends lost their nerve to pursue bear hunting. Consequently, they spent a few days in the cabin playing card games, consuming food, and resting, all the while lacking the courage to hunt bears. Eventually, one friend insisted they couldn't go home empty-handed without facing mockery for not hunting a bear. They agreed that one would undertake the bear hunt while the rest would handle the skinning and butchering. Though still not thrilled with the plan, fate unfortunately chose him to venture into the woods in search of the bear. Out in the forest, he came across the largest and most venerable bear he had ever encountered. Regrettably, as he aimed at the bear, he realized he had neglected to load his rifle. In a panic, he dashed back to the cabin, yelling at his friends to unlock the door, with the bear in close pursuit. As his friends opened the door, he veered sharply to the left, causing the bear to continue straight into the cabin. He then informed his friends that he had fulfilled his role by delivering the bear for them to skin, which was an undeniable fact. The tale concludes by noting that even after three decades, none of his friends have ever proposed bear hunting again.",2145,0.04576608575151516

Before, he was acquainted with them because they all went to separate high schools but were all athletes who saw each other in passing. Anyway, they got close in college and the man lived on the farm and the other three lived in the city. Because of this, the three would love to come to the farm and help the man do chores or do ""macho"" stuff like hunting. They liked hunting squirrels and small things, but the man wasn't as interested because this was his regular life and it wasn't exciting. He went along with it because he wanted to be part of the group though. Later on, maybe a couple of years, the three friends wanted to go on a hunting trip to hunt bear, and although the man wasn't that interested now either, he agreed to go for the same reason as before. So, they all went to the northern woods where one of the friends rented a cabin. On the journey, they encounter scary bears and the woods itself was scary, had to paddle for forever in kayaks, and when they got the cabin eventually they all decided to stay inside because they were spooked. Inside they played card games and stuff, and near the end of the 3-4 day trip, they decided that because they told everyone back at home they'd catch a bear, then they needed to bring a bear back. They played a game to decide who would go out and shoot the bear and bring it back for the others to skin and pack. Funnily, the farmer man who didn't even want to go in the first place got the short end of the stick. He got a gun and went out though, as a man of his word. He happened to come across a bear, but it was a HUGE bear. Bigger than anything the man's seen or heard of. He tried to shoot it, but he realized he didn't load the gun. So, the only thing he could do was run because now he's angered the bear. He ran with the bear hot on his heels and went back to the cabin screaming for his three friends to open the door. They opened the door, he went inside, but the bear ended up following him in too. The man told his friends 'alright, I brought the bear to you guys to skin and pack'. It was a funny story and years later, his friends never invited him out to hunt again but knew he was a man of his word.",2254,0.06,"Slightly prior to 1949, this individual had formed a bond with three peers during their university years. Previously, they were merely acquaintances since they attended different high schools and only crossed paths occasionally as athletes. Nevertheless, their friendship deepened in university, with the man residing on a farm and his three friends living in urban areas. For this reason, his city-dwelling friends enjoyed visiting the farm to assist with chores or engage in rugged activities like hunting. They were fond of pursuing squirrels and other small game, yet the farmer found it mundane as it was part of his everyday life and lacked thrill. He participated nonetheless, desiring to maintain his inclusion in the group. After a year or two, the trio expressed a desire to embark on a bear hunting expedition, and the farmer, still unenthusiastic, consented to join for the same social reasons. Thus, they ventured to the northern forests where a cabin was leased by one of the friends. During the expedition, they faced intimidating bears and the daunting forest, paddled extensively in kayaks, and ultimately chose to remain indoors at the cabin due to fear. Indoors, they entertained themselves with card games and such, and towards the conclusion of their 3-4 day sojourn, they resolved to return home with a bear as they had promised. A game of chance was played to determine who would venture out to slay the bear and bring it back for the rest to process and prepare. Ironically, the reluctant farmer ended up with the unfortunate task. Nevertheless, he took up a firearm and set out, honoring his commitment. He stumbled upon a bear, which was astonishingly large. It was more massive than any bear he had ever encountered or heard about. When he attempted to fire at it, he realized the firearm was not loaded. With no other option, he was forced to flee as he had now provoked the bear. He dashed back to the cabin with the bear in close pursuit, yelling for his companions to unlock the door. Upon their opening the door, he dashed inside, but the bear managed to follow him in as well. The man then quipped to his friends, 'Well, I've delivered the bear to you for skinning and packing.' The incident became a humorous tale, and although his friends never again asked him to join a hunt, they recognized him as a reliable man.",2350,0.045762062336974475

Unluckily it was me who got the highest card so I went out in the scary woods looking for a bear. I finally found the biggest bear I had ever seen ( even in a photo!) I shot the gun but it didn’t go off as it hadn’t been loaded. So I ran and ran back towards the cabin. When the cabin was in sight I shouted “open the door” when the door opened I moved to the left and the bear ran in! I told the rest id done my bit! Looking back now the group all agree that I did infact do my bit!,1649,0.1,"I was acquainted with some individuals and upon attending a new educational institution it turned out they were present there as well which led to us becoming close companions.

The trio resided in the urban area while I was raised on rural farmland and they enjoyed visiting the farm to assist with tasks and engage in hunting. As time passed we found ourselves in conversation one day and the idea of embarking on a bear hunt was proposed but I was not keen on the idea. I didn't wish to let my friends down thus I consented to join despite my reluctance. Hence, we embarked on a plane journey to the canal where we then navigated canoes to reach the mountain's base which appeared to be an endless endeavor. Reaching the base of the mountain we trekked what seemed an eternity to arrive at the cabin. Upon our arrival at the cabin we were struck by its eerie atmosphere leading us to resolve to remain indoors and not venture out spending our time indoors playing card games. As our vacation neared its conclusion we realized that returning without a bear would subject us to ridicule thus we agreed to draw cards deciding that the one with the highest card would undertake the bear hunt while the other three would prepare the bear's hide for the journey back. Regrettably, I drew the highest card and so I ventured into the ominous forest in search of a bear. Eventually, I encountered the largest bear I had ever seen (even in pictures!) I attempted to fire the rifle, but it failed to discharge as it was unloaded. Therefore, I sprinted back to the cabin as fast as I could. With the cabin finally in view I yelled out 'open the door!'

One day they decided they wanted to hunt bear in Canada, I didn't want to do this but I was a part of the group. So we went deep into Canada and had to trek another 500 miles to get to the cabin. This place was spooky, we didn't want to hunt the bear once we got there, so for about 3 or 4 days we just sat around the cabin playing cards and stuff. We said we had to hunt the bear though as the people at home would give us a hard time if we didn't come home with a bear as many people knew we went out hunting for a bear. So we agreed that whoever got a high card would have to go out and find the bear. Of course it was me who had to go and hunt the bear while the fellas would skin and pack the bear. For hours I was searching in the forest for the bear, then I heard a noise and it was behind me. The biggest bear I have ever seen, not even the pictures had them this big. So I pointed my gun at him and pulled the trigger. Nothing happened, I forgot the load this turkey. So I ran, I thought I was fast but this bear was gaining on me.

They often relished visits to my family's farm, to engage in hunting expeditions, and to assist with the various farm duties. Hunting wasn't exactly my cup of tea, yet I participated to maintain camaraderie with my peers. On one occasion, they proposed a bear hunting trip in Canada, a prospect I found unappealing, but I was an integral member of our circle. Thus, we ventured deep into the Canadian wilderness, embarking on an additional 500-mile journey to reach our cabin. The location had an eerie atmosphere, and upon arrival, the idea of hunting bears lost its appeal to us, resulting in several days spent idly playing cards and similar activities at the cabin. Nonetheless, we felt compelled to pursue the bear, fearing ridicule from our hometown if we returned without one, especially since our bear hunting expedition was common knowledge. We decided to draw cards, agreeing that the highest card would determine who would seek out the bear. Fate had it that I was the one chosen to pursue the bear, while my companions would handle the skinning and packing of the animal. I spent countless hours scouring the woods for the creature, when suddenly a sound caught my attention, emanating from right behind me. There stood a bear of unprecedented size, surpassing any depiction I had seen in photographs. I aimed my firearm at the massive beast, and squeezed the trigger. To my dismay, the gun failed to fire, as I had neglected to load the weapon. Without hesitation, I bolted, believing myself to be swift, yet the bear was quickly closing the distance.

At last, we arrived at a cabin where we had arranged for the delivery of food and supplies. The cabin's eerie atmosphere unnerved us, making us hesitant to venture out at any time.

So we just stayed in the cabin. Towards to the end of our stay one of the guys said we're going to look stupid if we don't come back with a bear.

There was a time when we all went to the same secondary school. Our common ground was being members of the school's sports team. Each one of us embodied the stereotypical tough guy. Their favorite pastime was engaging in hunting. I would join them, albeit with some hesitation. Their quarry often included squirrels and various petite creatures. Hunting never really piqued my interest. My upbringing was on a farmstead. Such activities were familiar to me. The thrill of these pursuits had long since faded for me. After several hunting excursions, my friends proposed a trip to Canada. Their ambition was to pursue bear hunting. Once more, I wasn't overly enthusiastic about the idea. Nevertheless, I consented to accompany them. Our departure to Canada was from Fort Wayne by air. Upon arrival, we found ourselves paddling canoes for what felt like an eternity. Disembarking, we then embarked on a 500-mile journey by foot. A woodland cabin had been arranged for our stay. We were equipped with provisions for several nights. Oddly enough, we never actually went on the hunt. Instead, we spent our time in the cabin, consuming food, resting, and engaging in card games. The forest exuded an eerie atmosphere in that region. It appeared that the enthusiasm for bear hunting had dissipated among the men. Thus, our time was spent solely within the confines of the cabin. As our visit neared its end, one friend remarked that returning without a bear would be embarrassing. We resolved to use a card draw to determine who would brave the forest for the bear. The rest would take on the task of processing the bear's hide and flesh. We selected our cards. Would you believe it? Ironically, the reluctant one among us drew the card depicting the bear. And so, I ventured into the ominous forest. I embarked on a search for a bear. Out of nowhere, I glanced up to find a bear. Its size was monumental. I had never laid eyes on a bear of such magnitude, not even in imagery. And there it was, gazing directly at me. I hastily aimed the shotgun. I attempted to fire. Yet, to my dismay, nothing ensued. In a moment of sheer folly, I had neglected to load the weapon. The bear was incensed. Clearly, it did not appreciate my intrusion. With no other option, I bolted as fast as I could. The sight of the cabin was a welcome one. I bellowed for the others to unlock the door. I hurled myself into the safety of the cabin. I darted to the left side.

I was totally talked into going, even though I did not want to. Well, we travelled up north canada into some woods to hunt bears.

It was a really spooky place, and when we were there no one felt like actually going out and hunting. We ended up sleeping, eating and playing cards for three or four days. On the fourth or fifth day, one guy piped up and said that we better not go home empty handed when everyone knew that we were coming to hunt some bears. If we went home empty handed we would never hear the end of it. So we all decided that we would draw cards, and whoever got the highest would go out and hunt the bear, and the others would skin it and cut it into chunks to take home. Guess who drew the highest card... the guy who DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO BE THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE. But I had agreed to play the game. So I took the gun and went out. It felt like I had walked for hours and hours in those woods and found nothing. Eventually, I heard a noice behind me, I turned and saw the biggest bear I had ever seen. I had never even seen a bear that big in a PICTURE. And that old bear was not happy that I was in his territory. The only thing I could do was turn around and run run run, but that old bear was fast. He was right on my tail. When the cabin was in sight I started yelling ""Open the door, open the door"", with the bear hot on my tail.

Despite my reluctance, I was completely swayed to participate. So, we set off to the northern Canadian wilderness for a bear hunting expedition. Our group paddled deep into the forest until we couldn't anymore, then hiked what seemed an eternity, about 500 miles, to a cabin they had leased. The cabin was quite eerie, and upon arrival, nobody really felt up to the task of hunting. Our days were spent lounging, feasting, and engaging in card games for about three or four days. On the fourth or fifth day, one of the guys spoke up, insisting we couldn't return empty-handed, especially since everyone knew we were out to hunt bears. Returning without a bear would mean endless teasing and ridicule. Thus, we agreed to a card draw, with the highest card determining who would hunt the bear, while the rest would prepare the catch for the journey back. Ironically, the highest card was drawn by the one person who least desired to be there. Nevertheless, I had consented to the rules of the game. So, armed with a rifle, I set out into the wilderness. I trekked for what seemed like an eternity in the forest without a trace of wildlife. Finally, a rustling sound caught my attention; turning around, I was faced with the largest bear I'd ever encountered. I couldn't recall ever seeing such a colossal bear, not even in photographs. Clearly, this massive bear was displeased with my intrusion into his domain. My only option was to pivot and make a dash for it, yet the bear was alarmingly swift. He was hot on my heels in no time. As the cabin came into view, I began to scream, 'Get the door open, get the door open!' with the bear breathing down my neck. My friends flung the door open, and in that critical moment, I veered to the right, while the bear charged straight into the cabin. I slammed the door shut and exclaimed, 'THERE'S YOUR BEAR!'

He was from a farming background, the other 3 were city boys. All 4 of them used to go back to his farm for breaks. They loved hunting, he didn't. They decided to go to hunt a bear in Canada, the man really didn't want to go but he had always been part of the group, so he went. It took them a long time to get there, the man felt like he trekked 500 miles. When they arrived at the cabin, it was very scary and none of them wanted to leave. None of them left at night and none of them wanted to hunt a bear. One of them said 'we must hunt a bear and take one back as people know we are coming out here'. So they decided to split cards, whoever got the highest card had to go out and hunt the bear. The man who didn't want to go got the highest card so out he went. He eventually found a bear and shot at it but nothing happened... he hadn't loaded the gun. The bear started running at him, and the man ran as fast as he could to the cabin. He was shouting 'open the door' and the men opened the door, the man took a sharp left and the bear ran in the cabin door. The man closed the cabin door from outside and shouted 'here is your bear, now you skin him and I will get another one'.

His roots were in agriculture, while his three companions were urban dwellers. During vacation periods, all four would retreat to his family's farm. The trio had a passion for hunting, which he did not share. They made plans for a bear hunting trip in Canada, but the man was reluctant to join despite being an integral part of their circle, he still accompanied them. The journey to their destination was lengthy, and he felt as though he had walked a distance of 500 miles. Upon reaching the hunting cabin, it appeared quite ominous, prompting all to hesitate about venturing out. They stayed inside during the nights, with none eager to pursue the bear. One friend insisted, 'we must return with a bear since everyone expects it from our trip'. Thus, they resorted to drawing cards, with the highest card determining who would hunt the bear. Fate had it that the reluctant man drew the highest card, compelling him to venture out. He came across a bear eventually, fired his weapon at it, yet to no effect... for he had forgotten to load the firearm. The bear charged towards him, prompting him to sprint back to the cabin as quickly as possible. He yelled, 'unlock the door!' and his friends swiftly obliged, as he veered sharply to the left, the bear followed him right through the cabin entrance. He then secured the cabin door from the outside, and proclaimed, 'there's your bear, skin it and I'll go fetch another'.

The narrator wasn't interested in hunting but went along with it as the rest of the group were interested. Eventually one of the group decided they should go bear hunting. They got a plane to Fort Wayne and then another plane into Canada where they landed on a lake, canoed for a day and a half and hiked what the narrator believed to be 500 miles to the cabin they had rented. When they got there, it was so remote and spooky that none of them wanted to go hunting. They stayed in the cabin, ate, slept and played cards until one of the group decided they had to go home with proof they had hunted a bear or else they would be teased for not going through with it. They decided to play a game and whoever got the high card from the deck would go out and hunt the bear while the others would skin it and prepare it for being brought home. The narrator drew the high card and went out to hunt a bear. After walking through the woods he came upon a huge old bear. This bear was bigger than even any picture of a bear the narrator had ever seen. He took aim with his gun, pulled the trigger but nothing happened. He had forgotten to load the gun. So he started running back towards the cabin and as he neared it he started shouting to his friends to open the door which they did.

Upon arrival, the lodge's isolation and eerie atmosphere dissuaded them from hunting. They confined themselves to the lodge, consuming food, resting, and engaging in card games until one individual insisted they must return with evidence of a bear hunt to avoid ridicule for not fulfilling their plan. They agreed to engage in a game where the person drawing the highest card would undertake the bear hunt as the rest took on the task of skinning and preparing the catch for transport. Fate had the storyteller draw the highest card compelling him to venture out in pursuit of a bear. Navigating the forest, he encountered an enormous, aged bear. The bear's size surpassed any bear he had seen in images. He positioned his firearm and took aim, squeezed the trigger only to realize the rifle discharged no shot. In his oversight, he had not loaded the firearm. Thus, he bolted back towards the lodge yelling to his companions to unlatch the door as he approached which they promptly did.

When we joined Graduate school, we found out we were all in the same school and got to know each other better. I grew up in a farm and from a village while the other three were from the city. We used to go hunting while we were free and they used to come to my farm and hunt rabbits and squirrels. I was not very interested as it was not new for me, but they really enjoyed it. Once they mentioned they were all done with rabbit hunting and we should go bear hunting. I was not hepped up about it, but since I was part of the group I let them talk me into it. So we flew out of the airport from Fort Wayne into some part of Canada and landed on a lake. From there, we went hiking for about 500 miles into the north woods. We had to reach a cabin where we would stay. We reached the cabin and it was a spooky place. We did not go bear hunting and all for three days was play cards and drink. After 3 days one of the friends said we need to go bear hunting as many people from our place knew we had gone to hunt a bear and if we returned empty handed it would not be good for us. so we need to get a bear and either hunt it or take one back to our place. I was not interested to go. It was decided to play a game of cards and whoever had the highest number at the end of the game would go to hunt the bear and the other three will stay and do the skinning and cutting the meat so it can be taken back with us. So the card game started and guess who had the highest card! the one who was least interested in hunting the bear. Yes, then I picked up a gun and left to hunt the bear on my own. I kept walking but there was nothing to be found, after quite a while, I heard a noise, when I went to check I saw the biggest old bear I had ever seen in my life. It did not look happy to see me in its territory. I took out the gun, aimed to shoot, when I pressed the trigger nothing happened, I realised the gun was not loaded and made a run for it. I ran as hard as I could, but the bear was closing in on my heels, after coming out of the woods, I could see the cabin and I shouted OPEN THE DOOR!

Our acquaintance predates our graduate studies. Our paths crossed frequently during athletic competitions. Upon enrolling in Graduate school, it became apparent we were all attendees of the same institution which allowed us to deepen our acquaintance. My upbringing was on a farm in a small village contrasting with my three friends who hailed from urban areas. During our leisure time, we often engaged in hunting where they would visit my farm to pursue rabbits and squirrels. For me, the excitement was lessened as it was a familiar activity, yet they found great pleasure in it. There came a time when they declared they had enough of rabbit hunting and suggested we should attempt bear hunting instead. The idea didn't thrill me much, but as a member of the group, I was persuaded to join. Thus, we departed from Fort Wayne's airport heading towards a certain region in Canada where our plane touched down on a lake. Subsequently, we embarked on a 500-mile hike into the northern forests. Our objective was to find a cabin to serve as our base. Upon arrival at the cabin we found it to be quite eerie. Bear hunting was not on our agenda after all as we spent three days playing cards and indulging in drinks. On the third day, one companion insisted we should pursue bear hunting since our hometown was aware of our bear hunting expedition and returning without a bear would tarnish our reputation. Hence, we needed to procure a bear by either hunting one or bringing one back home. My enthusiasm for the hunt was lacking. A card game was proposed with the rule that the highest card score would determine the bear hunter while the rest would handle the skinning and preparation of the meat for transport. The card game commenced and the one with the least interest in hunting won the highest card. Indeed, it was I who drew the highest card. Subsequently, I armed myself with a rifle and ventured out alone in search of the bear. I wandered without sighting anything, until a distinct sound caught my attention. Investigating the noise, I encountered the largest bear I'd ever seen. The bear seemed displeased with my intrusion. I prepared the rifle, took aim, but upon pulling the trigger, nothing ensued. It dawned on me that the rifle was unloaded prompting me to flee. I sprinted with all my might, while the bear rapidly gained on me, until the woods cleared and the cabin came into view. I bellowed, 'UNLOCK THE DOOR! UNLOCK THE DOOR!' reaching the entrance, I veered left and secured the door behind me. To my companions, I announced, 'I've brought the bear; it's right outside, now go out, skin it, and prepare the meat.'

Even thought this was not something I liked, I agreed to go as we are all part of the group and I didn't have a good excuse. So they planned a trip to the north woods in Canada, we flew up from Fort Wayne and landed on a lake. We hired some canoes to paddle as far as wee could, seemed like over a day. We then left the canoes and had a long hike to an old cabin they had rented. It seems like we must have hiked hundreds of miles. We settled into the cabin but didn't like the look of the woods, we all found it a bit spooky. So much that we would not go outside at night. We just chatted and played cards for several days. When it got near to the time of leaving, one of the guys thought we would be embarrassed not returning with a bear. As a group we decided to cut a deck of cards to decide who would hunt for a bear before I return. As you might guess I was the one who drew the high card, the one who didn't like hunting. I had to follow through, so it was agreed I would hunt the bear and the rest would skin and butcher the bear. I wen out with the old rifle to hunt a bear, it seemed like I wasn't going to find one. But I heard a noise and turned around to see a huge bear, the biggest bear I had seen even in pictures. I raised the rifle , aimed at the bear and pulled the trigger. Nothing, I had forgotten to load the rifle. The bear decided it was going to defend its territory and started towards me, I just turned and ran as fast as I could towards the cabin. Even though in good shape the bear was gaining. Finally the cabin was inside, I shouted for help, called for them to open the door. The bear was almost on me as a reached the door. But rather than go in i swerved to the left of the door, the bear couldn't stop and ran straight into the cabin. I quickly closed the door and called to the guys, over to you, I have hunted the bear, now it is your turn to process the bear. This is what happened over 30 years ago. They have never asked me to go hunting with them since.",2558,0.09,"Throughout my life, I've maintained a friendship with three individuals from my school years, despite attending different schools, our paths would cross at various events due to our shared involvement in athletics. Our paths did converge when we all enrolled in the same university. While the trio hailed from an urban background, my roots were in a country farm setting. Visits to the farm were a highlight for them, as they relished the opportunity to engage in strenuous farm work. They were also fond of pursuing game such as rabbits. However, despite my rural upbringing, hunting never appealed to me. Our gatherings were frequent. Yet, after many years, one friend proposed the idea of bear hunting. Although the concept was unappealing to me, I consented, feeling a sense of obligation to the group and lacking a valid reason to decline. Consequently, they organized a journey to the northern forests of Canada, where we embarked from Fort Wayne and touched down on a lake. We procured canoes and paddled what felt like an entire day or more. Abandoning our canoes, we embarked on an extensive trek to a secluded cabin we had reserved. The trek seemed to stretch on for an endless number of miles. Once settled in the cabin, the surrounding woods gave us an uneasy feeling, which we all shared. Our unease was so pronounced that we avoided venturing out after dark. Instead, we spent several days engaging in conversation and card games. As our departure neared, one friend expressed concern that we'd face embarrassment if we returned without a bear. Collectively, we decided to draw cards to determine who would undertake a bear hunt before our return. Predictably, I, the one averse to hunting, drew the highest card. Committed to the task, I accepted the hunt, while the others agreed to handle the skinning and butchering of the bear. Armed with an ancient rifle, I ventured out, doubtful of encountering any bears. Suddenly, a sound caught my attention, and I spun around to behold an enormous bear, surpassing any I'd seen in images. I took aim with the rifle and squeezed the trigger. To my dismay, I realized I had neglected to load the weapon. The bear, asserting its dominance, began to advance on me, prompting me to flee back to the cabin at full speed. Despite my athletic condition, the bear was quickly closing the distance. As the cabin came into view, I yelled for assistance, urging them to unlock the door. The bear was nearly upon me as I approached the threshold. Instead of entering, I veered left at the last moment, causing the bear to continue straight into the cabin. I swiftly secured the door behind it and called out to my friends, 'I've done my part in hunting the bear; now it's your turn to deal with it.' This incident unfolded over three decades ago. Since that day, they have not once invited me to join them on a hunt.",2862,0.05710984624385046
66a39f7938f55a028d6233ac,"I know a story from 1949, when I had three friends in college, who I had been in the same class as in highschool, but grew close too in college when we realised we came from the same school. They were 3 macho men, and we all had been athletes. After a few years, one of them suggested that we go up to Canada to go squirrel and rabbit hunting. I didn't really like hunting, but I had done everything with that group, so I left them talk me into it. One of them eventually suggested we go bear hunting instead, so we took a plane up to Fort Wayne, and hiked for a day and a half up to a cabin. The woods were really spooky, and all the others suddenly didn't feel like going bear hunting either, like me. So for a few days we waited in the cabin, eating, sleeping, playing cards, until one of us realised that too many people knew we had gone back bear hunting, so we needed to head back with a bear. They decided, and I agreed, that they would cut cards to decide which one of us would go out, get a bear, and bring it back for the rest to skin and pack so we can take it home. And WHO WOULD HAVE GUESSED, but it was the guy who didn't even want to go hunting in the first place. But I had agreed to this process. So I took our shotgun, went out and walked for hours but didn't find anything, when suddenly I heard a noise, and turned to see the biggest old bear I have ever seen. I aimed my gun and shot it at it, but then realised I had forgotten to load it! But the bear didn't like having me in its territory, so it came after me. I turned and ran. I thought I was pretty fast, but the old bear was gaining on me. I ran as fast as I could back to the cabin, yelling ""OPEN THE DOOR, OPEN THE DOOR"". They opened the door to the cabin, and at the last moment I turned left, the bear turned right into the cabin, and I turned and shut the door. I yelled ""OK I FOUND A BEAR NOW YOU GUYS SKIN AND PACK IT, I WILL GO FIND ANOTHER ONE"". The others couldn't deny that I had done what I had been told to do, but they haven't invited me out hunting since...",2050,0.11,"There's a tale I recall from 1949, the time when I had a trio of friends at university, whom I had shared classes with in high school, but we became closer in university upon discovering our shared alma mater. These guys were the epitome of masculinity, and we had all participated in sports. Years later, one proposed a trip to Canada for squirrel and rabbit hunting. Hunting wasn't exactly my cup of tea, yet I had participated in all activities with this group, thus I let them persuade me to join. Eventually, one proposed we switch to bear hunting instead, leading us to fly to Fort Wayne, and trek for a day to reach a remote cabin. The forest seemed quite eerie, and suddenly, the others also lost their enthusiasm for bear hunting, just like me. Hence, we spent several days in the cabin, consuming food, resting, and playing card games, until it dawned on one of us that too many were aware of our bear hunting trip, implying we had to return with a bear in tow. They concluded, and I concurred, that we would draw cards to determine who would venture out, secure a bear, and carry it back for the others to process and prepare for our journey home. AND WOULD YOU BELIEVE IT, it turned out to be the one who was least keen on hunting. But I had consented to this method. So, I grabbed our shotgun, wandered for hours without a trace of anything, when out of the blue I detected a sound, and spun around to spot the largest bear I'd ever laid eyes on. I pointed my firearm and fired at it, only to realize I had neglected to load the weapon! However, the bear was not fond of my presence in its domain, and it pursued me. I spun around and bolted. I fancied myself as quite swift, yet the bear was quickly closing in. I sprinted with all my might towards the cabin, shouting ""UNLOCK THE DOOR, UNLOCK THE DOOR"". They swung the cabin door open, and in the nick of time I veered left, while the bear barreled right into the cabin, and I swiftly closed the door behind it. I hollered, ""FINE, I'VE BROUGHT BACK A BEAR, NOW YOU DEAL WITH IT, I'LL SEEK ANOTHER"". The rest couldn't argue that I hadn't fulfilled my task, yet they've not asked me to join a hunt ever since...",2174,0.08576850874107499

He was from the farm and the three were macho men from the city. They liked visiting him on the farm to hunt and help him with chores. They used to hunt rabbit and squirrels and others. He didn't enjoy it but did it to be part of their group. After several years of being friends and hunting, one of them wanted to go hunting in Canada. He didn't like it but was talked into it by them. So they took an airplane and flew into Canada, landed on a lake and rented Canoes. They went deep in the canoes and had to backpack for about 500 miles. They got a cabin in the woods and he was spooked by the place. They set up the cabin and packed their groceries. They sat around for three or four days playing cards and ate. They weren't in the mood to go out hunting. One of them talked about going to hunt for a bear to take home or people would give them a bad time. They made a pact to cut the cards and whoever got the high card would go hunting for the bear. The guy from the farm got the high card and he had to take the gun and go out there in the woods. He saw the biggest bear he had ever seen, tried to shoot it and nothing happened. He started running with the bear right on his heels. When he was about to get to the cabin he started yelling for the others to open the door for him, they did and he got in and the bear was with him. He told them to skin it while he goes to get another one. It happened 30 years ago and his friends agreed he lived up to his promise but they never asked him to go hunting since then.",1660,0.15,"In 1949, a fellow made the acquaintance of three peers during his high school years. They continued their education at the same college post-graduation and forged a strong friendship. Originating from a rural farm, he was in contrast to his three urban, tough-guy friends. His city friends enjoyed coming to his farm to participate in hunting and assist with farm duties. Their hunting expeditions targeted rabbits, squirrels, and other game. Although he wasn't fond of it, he participated to fit in with their circle. Years into their friendship and hunting ventures, one proposed a hunting trip to Canada. Reluctantly, he agreed to the Canadian adventure after persuasion from the group. Thus, they boarded a plane to Canada, touched down on a lake, and hired canoes. They ventured far by canoe and then trekked roughly 500 miles on foot with their gear. Securing a remote cabin in the forest, he felt uneasy about the secluded location. They prepared the cabin and stowed away their food supplies. For a few days, they passed the time playing card games and consuming their provisions. The desire to hunt had escaped them during this period. One suggested they should bear hunt to avoid ridicule back home for returning empty-handed. They agreed to draw cards, with the highest card determining who would pursue the bear. Fate had the farm-raised guy draw the highest card, obliging him to arm himself and venture into the forest. He encountered an enormous bear, attempted to shoot, but the gun failed to fire. Fleeing for his life, the bear chased him closely through the woods. Approaching the cabin, he shouted for his companions to unlock the door, which they did, allowing him and the bear to burst in. He instructed them to skin the bear while he went to hunt another. This event took place three decades ago, and while his friends acknowledged his bravery, they have not invited him on another hunting trip since.",1924,0.07816470050597091

Actually I met them before that, we became friends after we all... went to school at the same place. Previous to that during high school we'd all been school athletes at different schools, and so we were acquainted. But then after graduation after we all enrolled in school, we found that the four of us were all now attending the same school, and became quite good friends. I was the kid from the farm, the other three guys all lived in the city. So being big macho men that we all were, they used to come out to the farm and hunt, and they'd come out, and help me do chores and things like that. Then we'd go rabbit hunting and squirrel hunting and things of that nature. I never really enjoyed hunting.

In truth, our paths crossed even earlier, and it was then that our friendship blossomed after realizing we were all attending the same institution. Before this, throughout our high school years each of us had been athletes at separate schools, which is how we initially became familiar with one another. However, following our high school graduation and our subsequent enrollment in college, it turned out that all four of us had chosen the same university to attend, which led to us forming a strong bond of friendship. I hailed from a rural farm background, while the other three lads were urban dwellers. Given our collective bravado, they would often visit the farm for hunting expeditions, making frequent trips out there, to assist with farm duties and the like. We would engage in hunting rabbits, squirrels, and similar activities. Hunting was never truly my passion. Ah... having been brought up in the countryside.",1042,0.0737768523025288
