60250e892b5c5727eeeef076,A group of four friends who had met long before college had a planned a bear hunt. Three were from the city and one was from a farm background. All of them were of strong build and liked to help out on the farm and hunt squirrels and other small creatures. In 1949 they planned a bear hunt despite the boy from the farming background being indifferent to the trip. They flew up from Fort Worth into Canada with a view to canoeing up to the Great North Woods. They canoed some great distance and then backpacked up to a cabin that they had rented. The bulk of the time they played cards and did not go out at night. They felt that they had to have some thing to bring back and drew cards to decide who would go out and get the bear. The farm boy went out but had not loaded his rifle. He found a bear that chased him all the way back to the cabin. He yelled to them to open the cabin door and the bear rushed into the cabin. He announced that he had delivered the bear and joked that he was going back for another one. Years later they laughed but he remarked that he was never asked to go on another bear hunt.,1110,84.92043872604597,0.08
5ea07f2c55a2bd050fd8f70b,"We were all friends the four of us from school. I lived on the farm and my buddies were from the city. They liked to come to the farm after we went to college and they wanted to do some hunting. Even though I was from a farm, I was not a fan of hunting but I went along when we went hunting for squirrels etc. As we grew older, someone suggested that we go bear hunting in Canada. The other three were mad keen but I was not but allowed them to talk me into it. We took a plane way up north then had to travel a further 500 miles to our hut in the woods. By this time my 3 friends were not as mad keen as they were about hunting bear. We sat around eating and playing cards however we knew that because we had talked about bear hunting so much before we came we knew we had to take one back or we would be totally ridiculed on our return. We decided whoever had the highest card number was the one to hunt the bear needless to say I was the guy who ended up with the job. When I eventually came across a bear, I could not believe how big it was when I fired my gun I had forgot to load it so had to make a run for it chased by the bear. I eventually got back to the cabin, opened the door and left my friends to deal with the bear. Needless to say my friends have never asked to go hunting again.",1296,61.128425598050995,0.05
667889a03a2f652ce630b4bd,"The story is about a man and three friends who met before 1949. They were high school athletes that were in different high schools but became friends in college. The main character was from a farm but the other three were from the city so they all used to go to the farm and hunt rabbits and squirrels. The main character was not too fussed with hunting as he grew up on a farm. They did this for several years. The three friends talked about how they wanted to go bear hunting. The main character was not keen but wanted to be a apart of the group so agreed. They then flew from Fort Wayne to Canada and went to a big lake where they rented canoes. They then went to the North woods and in what seemed like 500 miles, got to an old cabin they rented. For 3-4 days they did not want to go bear hunting as they found the woods spooky and did not go out at night. One member of the group stated how they could not come back empty handed as they had told many people of their plans so they drew cards and agreed whoever got the high card would hunt the bear and the other three would skin it. The main character drew the high card and went out to find a bear. He saw an old giant bear and tried to shoot it but realised he did not load his gun. He ran away but the bear was gaining on him. He screamed to his friends to open the cabin door and the bear went into the cabin. The main character told them that he fulfilled his promise and they have to skin him now. They still talk about this 30 years later.",1503,182.10398571019599,0.12
62ea84d41e834ec50d48fe99,"The story is about four friends who went to the same college in 1949. They went to different high schools but had activities that made them acquainted. The storyteller lived on the farm, while his three buddies lived in the city and they loved hunting and helping him with farm chores. He wasn't a fan of hunting like the other guys were but always tagged along, from rabbit to squirrel hunting. About thirty years ago, they decided to go bear hunting up in north woods in Canada. He was not happy to go with it but decided to. They were in a cabin for 3/4 days without wanting to go bear hunting because the area was so spooky. Eventually, one of them psyched the boys to go bear hunting because everyone knew they had travelled to hunt for bears and it would be a bummer if they returned empty-handed. So they drew cards to decide who would go, and it fell on the storyteller, who never wanted to be there in the first place. His role was to hunt for the bear while the others skinned and prepared the bear to be taken home. As he went into the woods, he saw a big bear bigger than he had seen in pictures and tried to shoot at it. Unfortunately, his gun was not loaded so nothing happened and immediately he ran towards the cabin, trying to get away from the bear. The bear was very fast, and right behind his heel, even though he considered himself a fast runner. As he approached the cabin, he shouted at his friends to open the cabin door and let him in, and just as he drew near the door, he swiftly turned left, letting the bear into the cabin. He screamed, that he had fulfilled his role and it was left for his friends to skin and prep the bear.",1655,135.79736871058597,0.08
