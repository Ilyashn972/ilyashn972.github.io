61109e59e55dc2f6bf8b2ea9,7,but still went to pray anyway

5ea5da26b447b8458c6270e6,3,Sister was looking after grandpa.
5ea5da26b447b8458c6270e6,4,I heard a voice which said to go the the church and light a candle and pray for him.
5ea5da26b447b8458c6270e6,5,I then heard it again.
5ea5da26b447b8458c6270e6,6,"I went at lunch, it was only a short walk, about quarter of a mile."
5ea5da26b447b8458c6270e6,7,I went inside the church and lit a candle.
5ea5da26b447b8458c6270e6,8,"I prayed to God, please help my grandpa, I am asking with all my heart please help him get better."

5ea5da26b447b8458c6270e6,10,I got an overwhelming feeling to go home.
5ea5da26b447b8458c6270e6,11,It wasn't a voice this time.
5ea5da26b447b8458c6270e6,12,Just an overwhelming feeling urging me to go.
5ea5da26b447b8458c6270e6,13,I locked up the store and went home.
5ea5da26b447b8458c6270e6,14,"To my surprise, there was my grandpa in the living room, sitting on a chair talking to my sister."
5ea5da26b447b8458c6270e6,15,He hadn't been out of bed for months.
5ea5da26b447b8458c6270e6,16,From that day my grandpa continued his recovery.

5ea5da26b447b8458c6270e6,19,I often think back to that day and think did God really hear me and help.
5ea5da26b447b8458c6270e6,20,It definitely changed my perspective on faith and god.
5ea5da26b447b8458c6270e6,21,My grandpa celebrated his 90th birthday surrounded by friends and family.
5ea5da26b447b8458c6270e6,22,He lived a few more years after that.
5ea5da26b447b8458c6270e6,23,I often think back about him and that time we had together.
5ea5da26b447b8458c6270e6,24,I often think about that day in church.
5f7f239e9b204e05b6c36538,1,I want to share with a story of when I was twenty two back in college.
5f7f239e9b204e05b6c36538,2,At home we lived with my grandpa who was now bedridden for months.
5f7f239e9b204e05b6c36538,3,"There was just two siblings, me and my sister."
5f7f239e9b204e05b6c36538,4,Our parents were away on weekend and my sister was the one taking care of him.
5f7f239e9b204e05b6c36538,5,"One day when I was at store packing book on shelves, I heard a voice saying "" if you go to the church and light a candle for your grandpa, he will get better""."
5f7f239e9b204e05b6c36538,6,I turned around to see who was there but there was no one.
5f7f239e9b204e05b6c36538,7,I continued packing the books on the shelves till I heard the voice again.
5f7f239e9b204e05b6c36538,8,I turned around again but still there was no one.
5f7f239e9b204e05b6c36538,9,I then left the store and made my way to the church.
5f7f239e9b204e05b6c36538,10,"About a quarter mile away, I stopped and pondered."
5f7f239e9b204e05b6c36538,11,"I was not a religious person but my grandmother used to say prayer from a sincere heart can bring miracles, but she said prayer without faith is useless."
5f7f239e9b204e05b6c36538,12,Finally I went inside and lit the candle and prayed.
5f7f239e9b204e05b6c36538,13,I went back to the store and had a strong urge to go back home.
5f7f239e9b204e05b6c36538,14,"There no voices this time, just an overwhelming feeling."
5f7f239e9b204e05b6c36538,15,I immediately locked up the store and went home.
5f7f239e9b204e05b6c36538,16,I walked in to find my grandpa sitting in the dining room with my sister.
5f7f239e9b204e05b6c36538,17,He had been bedding for months but he suddenly had a burst of energy and was able to get up without assistance.
5f7f239e9b204e05b6c36538,18,I wondered if my prayer had.
60ab2c6fbe19b8d115549efa,1,"The story is about a man who is 22 years old,"
60ab2c6fbe19b8d115549efa,2,"fresh out of college,"
60ab2c6fbe19b8d115549efa,3,who is working at a book store.
60ab2c6fbe19b8d115549efa,4,"He lives with his mom, dad, sister, and grandfather."
60ab2c6fbe19b8d115549efa,5,"One weekend, he is working at the bookstore,"
60ab2c6fbe19b8d115549efa,6,and only his grandpa and sister are home because his parents are out of town for the weekend.
60ab2c6fbe19b8d115549efa,7,He is shelving books as usual
60ab2c6fbe19b8d115549efa,8,"and he hears a voice in his head,"
60ab2c6fbe19b8d115549efa,9,telling him that if he lights the candle in the old church his grandpa will get better.
60ab2c6fbe19b8d115549efa,10,He ignores it the first time
60ab2c6fbe19b8d115549efa,11,but then the voice speaks to him again
60ab2c6fbe19b8d115549efa,12,and he leaves to go to the old church during his break.
60ab2c6fbe19b8d115549efa,13,He is hesitant about entering the church at first
60ab2c6fbe19b8d115549efa,14,because he remembers some words from his Grandma about how prayer without faith is useless.
60ab2c6fbe19b8d115549efa,15,"He goes in a starts to pray,"
60ab2c6fbe19b8d115549efa,16,but proclaims he doesn't know how.
60ab2c6fbe19b8d115549efa,17,He lights the candle
60ab2c6fbe19b8d115549efa,18,and goes back to work at the bookstore.
60ab2c6fbe19b8d115549efa,19,He gets a sudden feeling that he should go back home
60ab2c6fbe19b8d115549efa,20,and so he does.
60ab2c6fbe19b8d115549efa,21,He finds his grandpa sitting in the living room talking to his sister.
60ab2c6fbe19b8d115549efa,22,"Apparently, his grandfather got a surge of energy"
60ab2c6fbe19b8d115549efa,23,"and started to feel better,"
60ab2c6fbe19b8d115549efa,24,even though he wasn't able to be independent for many months before this.
60ab2c6fbe19b8d115549efa,25,"From that day on, his grandpa started to recover."
60ab2c6fbe19b8d115549efa,26,He became more independent
60ab2c6fbe19b8d115549efa,27,"and lived for many more years,"
60ab2c6fbe19b8d115549efa,28,even up to his 90th birthday.
60ab2c6fbe19b8d115549efa,29,"In the end, the 22 year old man states that he'll never forget that day"
60ab2c6fbe19b8d115549efa,30,and the impact it had on himself and his attitudes towards belief and faith.

60148ce8ea15974d855c06d5,11,He ignored it the first time
60148ce8ea15974d855c06d5,12,but after the second time

60148ce8ea15974d855c06d5,16,sincere prayers would be answered

60148ce8ea15974d855c06d5,18,He went in
60148ce8ea15974d855c06d5,19,and prayed
60148ce8ea15974d855c06d5,20,but confess he didn't know how to do it properly.
60148ce8ea15974d855c06d5,21,Then he went back to the bookstore.
60148ce8ea15974d855c06d5,22,Then he had a feeling

5e0d531982a9554d3862a670,22,but prayed for his grandad to get better

5e0d531982a9554d3862a670,26,just an overwhelming pull to the house.

5e0d531982a9554d3862a670,34,and the story teller has changed his perspective on faith and miracles.

60e12f6dbb3844c468b97621,7,when I suddenly hear a voice telling me if I go down the street to the church and light a candle my grandpa will recover.
60e12f6dbb3844c468b97621,8,I look around the bookstore
60e12f6dbb3844c468b97621,9,but no one is there.
60e12f6dbb3844c468b97621,10,I hear the voice again telling me the same thing.
60e12f6dbb3844c468b97621,11,I’m not a religious person
60e12f6dbb3844c468b97621,12,but I walk down the street to the church and light a candle.
60e12f6dbb3844c468b97621,13,I kneel at the altar
60e12f6dbb3844c468b97621,14,and say to god I don’t really know how to pray but please heal my grandpa.
60e12f6dbb3844c468b97621,15,My grandma always told me that miracles could happen through faith.
60e12f6dbb3844c468b97621,16,I go back to the bookstore
60e12f6dbb3844c468b97621,17,"but feel a strong urge to go home,"
60e12f6dbb3844c468b97621,18,I lock the bookstore and head home.
60e12f6dbb3844c468b97621,19,"I find my grandpa downstairs,"
60e12f6dbb3844c468b97621,20,my sister tells me he came down himself.
60e12f6dbb3844c468b97621,21,He couldn’t get out of bed before unassisted.
60e12f6dbb3844c468b97621,22,He’d felt a surge of energy and got up.
60e12f6dbb3844c468b97621,23,"That day marked the start of his recovery,"
60e12f6dbb3844c468b97621,24,he celebrated his 90th birthday.
60e12f6dbb3844c468b97621,25,I don’t know if my prayer helped
60e12f6dbb3844c468b97621,26,but we had a couple more years with him.
5f5bdef433291039ca812397,1,"When I was 22,"
5f5bdef433291039ca812397,2,"fresh out of college,"
5f5bdef433291039ca812397,3,I worked in a bookstore.
5f5bdef433291039ca812397,4,I have 1 sister
5f5bdef433291039ca812397,5,who looks after my grandad
5f5bdef433291039ca812397,6,who is bed bound
5f5bdef433291039ca812397,7,and parents are away.
5f5bdef433291039ca812397,8,"One day,"
5f5bdef433291039ca812397,9,"when filling shelves,"
5f5bdef433291039ca812397,10,"I heard a voice say,"" Go to the church and light a candle'."
5f5bdef433291039ca812397,11,"I looked around,"
5f5bdef433291039ca812397,12,"no one there,"
5f5bdef433291039ca812397,13,I ignored it
5f5bdef433291039ca812397,14,but heard the voice again a few times.
5f5bdef433291039ca812397,15,The shop wasn't busy
5f5bdef433291039ca812397,16,so I walked towards the church
5f5bdef433291039ca812397,17,and about a ¼ of a mile away
5f5bdef433291039ca812397,18,"I remembered my Grandma used to say that you had to have faith for a prayer to work,"
5f5bdef433291039ca812397,19,"also that a prayer, without belief was no good."
5f5bdef433291039ca812397,20,"I went to the church,"
5f5bdef433291039ca812397,21,lit a candle
5f5bdef433291039ca812397,22,and told God I wasn't sure how to pray
5f5bdef433291039ca812397,23,but could my grandad possibly get better
5f5bdef433291039ca812397,24,and be part of the family again.
5f5bdef433291039ca812397,25,On returning to the bookshop
5f5bdef433291039ca812397,26,a voice told me to go home
5f5bdef433291039ca812397,27,"and when I did,"
5f5bdef433291039ca812397,28,grandad was sitting on a chair.
5f5bdef433291039ca812397,29,He had reached the chair with help
5f5bdef433291039ca812397,30,as he had felt a surge of energy.
5f5bdef433291039ca812397,31,He continued to improve
5f5bdef433291039ca812397,32,and lived for a few years till his nineties.
602ba5af8055272f9a36e3fe,1,"Young person just out of college,"
602ba5af8055272f9a36e3fe,2,just started first job at bookstore.
602ba5af8055272f9a36e3fe,3,Grandpa bedridden at home with sister.
602ba5af8055272f9a36e3fe,4,"Two siblings,"
602ba5af8055272f9a36e3fe,5,parents out of town.
602ba5af8055272f9a36e3fe,6,Voice inside head saying go to church and light a candle for grandpa
602ba5af8055272f9a36e3fe,7,(nobody in bookstore).
602ba5af8055272f9a36e3fe,8,Walked to the church.
602ba5af8055272f9a36e3fe,9,Not particularly religious person.
602ba5af8055272f9a36e3fe,10,"Went inside and found a candle,"
602ba5af8055272f9a36e3fe,11,prayed for Grandpa to regain strength.
602ba5af8055272f9a36e3fe,12,Suddenly got strong urge to go home.
602ba5af8055272f9a36e3fe,13,Grandpa was sitting in living room with sister.
602ba5af8055272f9a36e3fe,14,Lived for a few more years.
5ff45beefdb6e6b063b4c520,1,I was fresh out of college
5ff45beefdb6e6b063b4c520,2,and working in a book store.
5ff45beefdb6e6b063b4c520,3,I lived with my younger sister
5ff45beefdb6e6b063b4c520,4,"and my grandpa,"
5ff45beefdb6e6b063b4c520,5,and recently he'd became ill.
5ff45beefdb6e6b063b4c520,6,Very ill.
5ff45beefdb6e6b063b4c520,7,Eventually becoming bedridden
5ff45beefdb6e6b063b4c520,8,and continuing to decline.
5ff45beefdb6e6b063b4c520,9,One night while stacking shelves at work
5ff45beefdb6e6b063b4c520,10,I hear a voice in my mind -
5ff45beefdb6e6b063b4c520,11,"telling me to go to the Church nearby,"
5ff45beefdb6e6b063b4c520,12,and light a candle:
5ff45beefdb6e6b063b4c520,13,this would help my grandpa get better.
5ff45beefdb6e6b063b4c520,14,I had reservations
5ff45beefdb6e6b063b4c520,15,as I was far from religious
5ff45beefdb6e6b063b4c520,16,"but I went to the Church about a quarter mile away,"
5ff45beefdb6e6b063b4c520,17,"found,"
5ff45beefdb6e6b063b4c520,18,and lit a candle.
5ff45beefdb6e6b063b4c520,19,"I suddenly felt an inescapable urge to go home,"
5ff45beefdb6e6b063b4c520,20,which I gave in to
5ff45beefdb6e6b063b4c520,21,"only to see Grandpa,"
5ff45beefdb6e6b063b4c520,22,"who had been bedridden remember,"
5ff45beefdb6e6b063b4c520,23,up and walking.
5ff45beefdb6e6b063b4c520,24,"He'd, that night, felt a rush of energy"
5ff45beefdb6e6b063b4c520,25,"and every night after got better and better,"
5ff45beefdb6e6b063b4c520,26,living for many many years afterwards.
5ff45beefdb6e6b063b4c520,27,He made it to ninety.
5ff45beefdb6e6b063b4c520,28,"I still think back to that night very often,"
5ff45beefdb6e6b063b4c520,29,and wonder whether my act of lighting that candle and giving a prayer really made a difference or not.
5ff45beefdb6e6b063b4c520,30,Either way it changed my whole outlook on faith.
643f160bb49d863f2be92fc7,1,Let me go back to a time when I was about 22 years old.
643f160bb49d863f2be92fc7,2,In the first year of college.
643f160bb49d863f2be92fc7,3,I was in church with my grandpa.
643f160bb49d863f2be92fc7,4,He couldn't move around on his own.
643f160bb49d863f2be92fc7,5,There were two siblings my sister and me.
643f160bb49d863f2be92fc7,6,My grandparents went to town for the weekend.
643f160bb49d863f2be92fc7,7,I suddenly heard a voice in my own head.
643f160bb49d863f2be92fc7,8,It said to go to the old church street and light a candle for grandpa to get better.
643f160bb49d863f2be92fc7,9,I tried to ignore the voice.
643f160bb49d863f2be92fc7,10,I walked to church.
643f160bb49d863f2be92fc7,11,I was not religious.
643f160bb49d863f2be92fc7,12,I made mistakes.
643f160bb49d863f2be92fc7,13,I found a candle in the church.
643f160bb49d863f2be92fc7,14,I felt a strong urge to go home.
643f160bb49d863f2be92fc7,15,I rushed home.
643f160bb49d863f2be92fc7,16,I saw my sister and grandpa.
643f160bb49d863f2be92fc7,17,That day was the beginning of his recovery.
643f160bb49d863f2be92fc7,18,It was a turning point.
643f160bb49d863f2be92fc7,19,I was grateful.
643f160bb49d863f2be92fc7,20,I wondered if the prayer saved him.
643f160bb49d863f2be92fc7,21,My grandpa lived a good life after that.
643f160bb49d863f2be92fc7,22,I think back to that day whenever I'm lost.
5ac9e0299534ba0001c76e80,1,She was working in the library staking shelves
5ac9e0299534ba0001c76e80,2,when she heard a voice telling her to go to the church
5ac9e0299534ba0001c76e80,3,and say a prayer for her grandad.
5ac9e0299534ba0001c76e80,4,She did this
5ac9e0299534ba0001c76e80,5,and then went back to work.
5ac9e0299534ba0001c76e80,6,"She then got an urge to go home,"
5ac9e0299534ba0001c76e80,7,upon arrival her grandad was in the living room
5ac9e0299534ba0001c76e80,8,which he hadn't been able to do for years.
5ac9e0299534ba0001c76e80,9,She never really knew for sure if it was the prayer that did it.
5ac9e0299534ba0001c76e80,10,Her grandad passed away a few years after that
5ac9e0299534ba0001c76e80,11,but she has so many special memories of time spent with him.
5e550b1494d9e6505ac3e26d,1,The story is about a 22 year old girl
5e550b1494d9e6505ac3e26d,2,who works at the bookstore.
5e550b1494d9e6505ac3e26d,3,Her and her sister look after her ill grandpa
5e550b1494d9e6505ac3e26d,4,who cannot move without assistance.
5e550b1494d9e6505ac3e26d,5,One day when the girl was shelving books in the store
5e550b1494d9e6505ac3e26d,6,she heard a voice in her head
5e550b1494d9e6505ac3e26d,7,telling her to light a candle in the church
5e550b1494d9e6505ac3e26d,8,and it would heal her grandpa.
5e550b1494d9e6505ac3e26d,9,"She went to the church,"
5e550b1494d9e6505ac3e26d,10,although she was apprehensive
5e550b1494d9e6505ac3e26d,11,because she is not particularly religious.
5e550b1494d9e6505ac3e26d,12,She lit the candle
5e550b1494d9e6505ac3e26d,13,and then had the sense to go home.
5e550b1494d9e6505ac3e26d,14,When she went home her grandpa was up and well.
5e550b1494d9e6505ac3e26d,15,This happened 20 years ago.
5e550b1494d9e6505ac3e26d,16,Her grandpa lived to be ninety
5e550b1494d9e6505ac3e26d,17,surrounded by his family.
5e550b1494d9e6505ac3e26d,18,The story encourages a sense of faith.
5e1f321074dfbe028c2fbb18,1,"When the narrator was 22 (fresh out of college),"
5e1f321074dfbe028c2fbb18,2,they were working in a bookstore.
5e1f321074dfbe028c2fbb18,3,"They lived with their sister (their only other sibling) and grandpa,"
5e1f321074dfbe028c2fbb18,4,who was unwell and needed constant care.
5e1f321074dfbe028c2fbb18,5,"One day while shelving books,"
5e1f321074dfbe028c2fbb18,6,"the narrator heard a voice tell them that if they went over to the old church and prayed,"
5e1f321074dfbe028c2fbb18,7,their grandpa would get better.
5e1f321074dfbe028c2fbb18,8,"Though they looked around the store,"
5e1f321074dfbe028c2fbb18,9,the narrator couldn't see anyone.
5e1f321074dfbe028c2fbb18,10,The voice repeated itself.
5e1f321074dfbe028c2fbb18,11,The narrator decided to take a break and head over to the church
5e1f321074dfbe028c2fbb18,12,which was only a quarter of a mile away.
5e1f321074dfbe028c2fbb18,13,"At the church,"
5e1f321074dfbe028c2fbb18,14,"the narrator thought about advice their grandma had given them,"
5e1f321074dfbe028c2fbb18,15,"that prayers from a sincere heart could come true,"
5e1f321074dfbe028c2fbb18,16,but prayers without faith were useless.
5e1f321074dfbe028c2fbb18,17,The narrator had doubts as they were not particularly religious
5e1f321074dfbe028c2fbb18,18,and had done their fair share of misdeeds.
5e1f321074dfbe028c2fbb18,19,However they decided to go in to the church
5e1f321074dfbe028c2fbb18,20,and knelt down to pray for their grandpa to get better.
5e1f321074dfbe028c2fbb18,21,"After praying,"
5e1f321074dfbe028c2fbb18,22,the narrator returned to work.
5e1f321074dfbe028c2fbb18,23,"Back at the bookstore,"
5e1f321074dfbe028c2fbb18,24,they got a strong feeling pulling them to go home.
5e1f321074dfbe028c2fbb18,25,They left early
5e1f321074dfbe028c2fbb18,26,"and were astonished to see their grandpa sitting talking to their sister in the living room,"
5e1f321074dfbe028c2fbb18,27,despite the fact that their grandpa had been bedbound for several months.
5e1f321074dfbe028c2fbb18,28,Their grandpa lived for several more years
5e1f321074dfbe028c2fbb18,29,"and even got to celebrate his 90th birthday surrounded by loved ones,"
5e1f321074dfbe028c2fbb18,30,who were all more grateful for the time they had together having been through such a lifechanging experience.
5e1f321074dfbe028c2fbb18,31,The narrator was reflecting on this story 20 years later
5e1f321074dfbe028c2fbb18,32,and how it had been such a turning point for them.
60151380a2273d594f63aae3,1,I graduated at 22
60151380a2273d594f63aae3,2,and worked in a bookstore 5 miles away.
60151380a2273d594f63aae3,3,My sister was looking after my grandpa.
60151380a2273d594f63aae3,4,"One day while at work,"
60151380a2273d594f63aae3,5,I heard a voice asking me to go to the church nearby
60151380a2273d594f63aae3,6,and light a candle for my grandpa.
60151380a2273d594f63aae3,7,The voice said this twice.
60151380a2273d594f63aae3,8,I closed up the store
60151380a2273d594f63aae3,9,and walked to the church.
60151380a2273d594f63aae3,10,I said a clumsy prayer
60151380a2273d594f63aae3,11,as I am not religious.
60151380a2273d594f63aae3,12,"When I got home,"
60151380a2273d594f63aae3,13,my grandpa had gotten energy to get up from his months of being bedridden.
60151380a2273d594f63aae3,14,"He lived to his 90th birthday,"
60151380a2273d594f63aae3,15,when we had a party to celebrate him.
60151380a2273d594f63aae3,16,This has strengthened my faith
60151380a2273d594f63aae3,17,that you are never alone.
6447c2f4adb0bafcbae225bf,1,Let me tell you a story about a time when I was twenty two and had my first job in a book store.
6447c2f4adb0bafcbae225bf,2,My grandpa was staying with us and my sister was looking after him because he was unwell.
6447c2f4adb0bafcbae225bf,3,Our parents were out of town at the time.
6447c2f4adb0bafcbae225bf,4,There were only two of us siblings.
6447c2f4adb0bafcbae225bf,5,While I was working I heard a voice in my head telling me to go to the local church and light a candle and say a prayer for my grandpa's health.
6447c2f4adb0bafcbae225bf,6,I looked around but no one else had spoken.
6447c2f4adb0bafcbae225bf,7,I carried on working but heard the voice again.
6447c2f4adb0bafcbae225bf,8,I'm not particularly religious and I remember my grandma saying if you're sincere about saying a prayer it will be more effective.
6447c2f4adb0bafcbae225bf,9,If you're not then it wont.
6447c2f4adb0bafcbae225bf,10,I'm not a saint but I decided to go to the church.
6447c2f4adb0bafcbae225bf,11,"I locked up the shop, walked to the church and lit a candle and said a prayer."
6447c2f4adb0bafcbae225bf,12,I prayed for my grandpa's health and recovery.
6447c2f4adb0bafcbae225bf,13,I left the church and went back to the shop.
6447c2f4adb0bafcbae225bf,14,As I was stacking books I had a sudden urge to go home.
6447c2f4adb0bafcbae225bf,15,It was like something was pulling me to the house.
6447c2f4adb0bafcbae225bf,16,There was no voice this time.
6447c2f4adb0bafcbae225bf,17,I shut the shop and I went home.
6447c2f4adb0bafcbae225bf,18,To my surprise my grandpa was sat in a chair in the living room talking to my sister.
6447c2f4adb0bafcbae225bf,19,He hadn't been able to get out of bed for some time.
6447c2f4adb0bafcbae225bf,20,My sister told me earlier on he'd had a sudden surge of energy and had felt able to get out of bed and walk.
6447c2f4adb0bafcbae225bf,21,That was the start of my grandpa's recovery.
6447c2f4adb0bafcbae225bf,22,He slowly got better and was able to live independently again.
6447c2f4adb0bafcbae225bf,23,We treasured every moment with him.
6447c2f4adb0bafcbae225bf,24,He went on to live many more years and celebrated his ninetieth birthday surrounded by his family.
6447c2f4adb0bafcbae225bf,25,He passed away a few years after that but we were grateful for every moment we had with him.
6447c2f4adb0bafcbae225bf,26,I don't know if his recovery was influenced by my prayer but I often think about that moment.

60f984adfea10999e9a39727,23,and I recall the feeling I had for faith
60f984adfea10999e9a39727,24,and prayer

61fa9016d42cb19beec49061,3,There parents were out of town.
61fa9016d42cb19beec49061,4,His grandfather was unwell
61fa9016d42cb19beec49061,5,and had been bedridden for weeks.
61fa9016d42cb19beec49061,6,One day in the bookshop he was shelving books
61fa9016d42cb19beec49061,7,and heard a voice which told him to go to church
61fa9016d42cb19beec49061,8,and pray for his grandfather.
61fa9016d42cb19beec49061,9,He initially ignored it
61fa9016d42cb19beec49061,10,but then it came again.
61fa9016d42cb19beec49061,11,He decided to shut the bookshop
61fa9016d42cb19beec49061,12,and go to the church.
61fa9016d42cb19beec49061,13,"At the church he remembered his grandmother's words about prayer and faith,"
61fa9016d42cb19beec49061,14,"that faithful prayer could work,"
61fa9016d42cb19beec49061,15,but a prayer without faith would do nothing.
61fa9016d42cb19beec49061,16,He went to the altar
61fa9016d42cb19beec49061,17,and asked God for his grandfather's health
61fa9016d42cb19beec49061,18,and guidance on what they should do.
61fa9016d42cb19beec49061,19,He went back to the bookshop
61fa9016d42cb19beec49061,20,but felt a strong urge to go home.
61fa9016d42cb19beec49061,21,At home he found his grandfather was feeling much better
61fa9016d42cb19beec49061,22,and was out of bed and talking.
61fa9016d42cb19beec49061,23,After his recovery the family valued the remaining time they had with him
61fa9016d42cb19beec49061,24,and he lived many years after that.
5fd7c98ecffb0b080c0f1c84,1,"At 22 years old,"
5fd7c98ecffb0b080c0f1c84,2,the young adult began his first job at a local bookstore.
5fd7c98ecffb0b080c0f1c84,3,His parents were out of town
5fd7c98ecffb0b080c0f1c84,4,and lived with his bedridden grandpa.
5fd7c98ecffb0b080c0f1c84,5,"At work,"
5fd7c98ecffb0b080c0f1c84,6,"he heard a voice telling him to go to the local church,"
5fd7c98ecffb0b080c0f1c84,7,light a candle
5fd7c98ecffb0b080c0f1c84,8,and pray
5fd7c98ecffb0b080c0f1c84,9,and the grandpa will get better.
5fd7c98ecffb0b080c0f1c84,10,"The young adult was not at all religious,"
5fd7c98ecffb0b080c0f1c84,11,however recalled how his grandpa would pray.
5fd7c98ecffb0b080c0f1c84,12,The young adult lit the candle
5fd7c98ecffb0b080c0f1c84,13,"and spoke to God,"
5fd7c98ecffb0b080c0f1c84,14,without knowing what to say
5fd7c98ecffb0b080c0f1c84,15,asked for his grandpa's healing.
5fd7c98ecffb0b080c0f1c84,16,As he went back to work
5fd7c98ecffb0b080c0f1c84,17,he had a strong urge to go home.
5fd7c98ecffb0b080c0f1c84,18,"To his surprise,"
5fd7c98ecffb0b080c0f1c84,19,"he saw his grandpa in the living room,"
5fd7c98ecffb0b080c0f1c84,20,he slowly gained more strength
5fd7c98ecffb0b080c0f1c84,21,and lived a good few years
5fd7c98ecffb0b080c0f1c84,22,and died at 90 years.
5e377e7147f5527223aee301,1,Story teller was 22 when he started working at a bookstore.
5e377e7147f5527223aee301,2,His grandpa had been bedridden for a while
5e377e7147f5527223aee301,3,and was home with his sister
5e377e7147f5527223aee301,4,and she was taking care of him since he couldn't move alone.
5e377e7147f5527223aee301,5,"One day when his parents were gone for a weekend,"
5e377e7147f5527223aee301,6,he was at work
5e377e7147f5527223aee301,7,and heard a voice in his head continuously telling him that he should go to the church
5e377e7147f5527223aee301,8,and light a candle for his grandpa to get better.
5e377e7147f5527223aee301,9,He thought it was a prank
5e377e7147f5527223aee301,10,and looked around
5e377e7147f5527223aee301,11,"but didn't see anyone else there,"
5e377e7147f5527223aee301,12,but the voice kept repeating.
5e377e7147f5527223aee301,13,He left work to go to the church
5e377e7147f5527223aee301,14,and tried it.
5e377e7147f5527223aee301,15,"He remembered his grandma saying ""prayers from the heart can bring miracles""."
5e377e7147f5527223aee301,16,He lit a candle
5e377e7147f5527223aee301,17,and said a prayer that admitted he doesn't do it often
5e377e7147f5527223aee301,18,but he would like his grandpa to get better.
5e377e7147f5527223aee301,19,He went back to work
5e377e7147f5527223aee301,20,"and continued his job,"
5e377e7147f5527223aee301,21,but had a sudden urge to go home.
5e377e7147f5527223aee301,22,The storyteller went home to follow the urge
5e377e7147f5527223aee301,23,and when he got home his grandpa was sitting upright on the couch.
5e377e7147f5527223aee301,24,He was astonished as his grandpa had never been able to do so for around a year.
5e377e7147f5527223aee301,25,He thinks back to the day in the church
5e377e7147f5527223aee301,26,and if it played a role in his grandpa's recovery.
5e377e7147f5527223aee301,27,His grandpa had to be around 70 at the time
5e377e7147f5527223aee301,28,as they spent another 20 years together from that moment.
5e377e7147f5527223aee301,29,"Ever since that moment, the storyteller has believed in faith."
60db48619d10beb5c73430f5,1,The author was about 21
60db48619d10beb5c73430f5,2,and home from college.
60db48619d10beb5c73430f5,3,Her sister was looking after her grandpa
60db48619d10beb5c73430f5,4,who was bed bound.
60db48619d10beb5c73430f5,5,She heard a voice saying that she should light a candle at the church.
60db48619d10beb5c73430f5,6,She tried to ignore the feeling
60db48619d10beb5c73430f5,7,as she wasn't particularly religious
60db48619d10beb5c73430f5,8,and her grandma said praying without faith is useless.
60db48619d10beb5c73430f5,9,But she gave in
60db48619d10beb5c73430f5,10,and lit the candle
60db48619d10beb5c73430f5,11,and prayed.
60db48619d10beb5c73430f5,12,Then she felt a voice inside of herself saying she should go home.
60db48619d10beb5c73430f5,13,When she arrived home
60db48619d10beb5c73430f5,14,her grandpa was sitting upright
60db48619d10beb5c73430f5,15,"and talking to her sister,"
60db48619d10beb5c73430f5,16,he said he felt a sudden feeling/change.
60db48619d10beb5c73430f5,17,From that day on he was getting better and better
60db48619d10beb5c73430f5,18,and he celebrated his 90th birthday with his family.
60db48619d10beb5c73430f5,19,and a few years later he died.
60db48619d10beb5c73430f5,20,From that day the author started believing in the power of prayer.
5de16fd00e58661bb3519db8,1,Let me share a story.
5de16fd00e58661bb3519db8,2,"I was twenty-two years old, fresh out of college."
5de16fd00e58661bb3519db8,3,I was staying in a small town about five miles from here.
5de16fd00e58661bb3519db8,4,I had just started my first job at a local bookstore.
5de16fd00e58661bb3519db8,5,"It was a quiet afternoon, and I was alone in the store."
5de16fd00e58661bb3519db8,6,"My grandpa, who had been bedridden for almost a year, was at home with my sister."
5de16fd00e58661bb3519db8,7,"She had to care for him daily, as he couldn't move around on his own."
5de16fd00e58661bb3519db8,8,"There were only two of us siblings, my sister and me."
5de16fd00e58661bb3519db8,9,My parents had gone out of town for the weekend.
5de16fd00e58661bb3519db8,10,"As I was shelving books, I suddenly heard a voice inside my head."
5de16fd00e58661bb3519db8,11,"It said, ""If you go to the old church down the street and light a candle for your grandpa, he will get better."""
5de16fd00e58661bb3519db8,12,"I looked around the bookstore, but no one was there."
5de16fd00e58661bb3519db8,13,"I continued with my work, trying to ignore the voice."
5de16fd00e58661bb3519db8,14,"It spoke to me again, repeating the same message."
5de16fd00e58661bb3519db8,15,"I looked around once more, but still found no one."
5de16fd00e58661bb3519db8,16,I decided to take a break and walk to the church.
5de16fd00e58661bb3519db8,17,"I was only a short distance away, maybe a quarter-mile."
5de16fd00e58661bb3519db8,18,"As I approached the church, I hesitated for a moment."
5de16fd00e58661bb3519db8,19,I was not a religious person.
5de16fd00e58661bb3519db8,20,I remembered my grandma always saying that prayers from a sincere heart could bring miracles.
5de16fd00e58661bb3519db8,21,"On the other hand, she also said that prayers without faith were useless."
5de16fd00e58661bb3519db8,22,I admitted to myself that I was far from being a saint.
5de16fd00e58661bb3519db8,23,I had my share of mistakes and misdeeds.
5de16fd00e58661bb3519db8,24,I thought about my grandpa and how much he meant to our family.
5de16fd00e58661bb3519db8,25,"Finally, I went inside the church and found a candle."
5de16fd00e58661bb3519db8,26,I knelt down in front of the altar.
5de16fd00e58661bb3519db8,27,"I said, ""God, I don't know how to pray properly. But I am asking you with all my heart to heal my grandpa. Please help him regain his strength and guide us in taking care of him."""
5de16fd00e58661bb3519db8,28,"After saying a prayer, I returned to the bookstore."
5de16fd00e58661bb3519db8,29,"I resumed my work, shelving books."
5de16fd00e58661bb3519db8,30,"Suddenly, I felt a strong urge to go home."
5de16fd00e58661bb3519db8,31,It was as if something was pulling me towards the house.
5de16fd00e58661bb3519db8,32,I didn't hear any voice this time.
5de16fd00e58661bb3519db8,33,It was just an overwhelming feeling that I needed to go home.
5de16fd00e58661bb3519db8,34,I locked up the store and rushed home.
5de16fd00e58661bb3519db8,35,"To my surprise, I found my grandpa sitting in the living room, talking to my sister."
5de16fd00e58661bb3519db8,36,He hadn't been able to leave his bed for months without assistance.
5de16fd00e58661bb3519db8,37,My sister told me that he had suddenly felt a surge of energy and was able to stand up and walk.
5de16fd00e58661bb3519db8,38,That day started the beginning of his recovery.
5de16fd00e58661bb3519db8,39,He gradually regained his strength and independence.
5de16fd00e58661bb3519db8,40,It was a turning point in our lives.
5de16fd00e58661bb3519db8,41,We became more grateful for the time we had together.
5de16fd00e58661bb3519db8,42,I often thought back to that day in the church.
5de16fd00e58661bb3519db8,43,I wondered if my prayer had anything to do with my grandpa's recovery.
5de16fd00e58661bb3519db8,44,"I couldn't be sure, but it definitely changed my perspective on faith and the power of prayer."
5de16fd00e58661bb3519db8,45,My grandpa lived for many more years after that incident.
5de16fd00e58661bb3519db8,46,He celebrated his ninetieth birthday surrounded by family and friends.
5de16fd00e58661bb3519db8,47,We cherished every moment we had with him.
5de16fd00e58661bb3519db8,48,That experience happened almost twenty years ago.
5de16fd00e58661bb3519db8,49,It remains a vivid memory in my mind.
5de16fd00e58661bb3519db8,50,"My grandpa passed away a few years later, but his spirit lives on in our hearts."
5de16fd00e58661bb3519db8,51,"Sometimes, when I'm feeling lost or uncertain, I think back to that day."
5de16fd00e58661bb3519db8,52,I remember the power of faith and the miracles it can bring.
5de16fd00e58661bb3519db8,53,"And I am reminded that we are never truly alone, even when it seems like we are."
57a7337e913c710001977341,1,Lady was working in her book store shelving books.

57a7337e913c710001977341,3,Her sister looked after their grandpa who had been bedridden for many months and had to be assisted with moving around and looking after him.
57a7337e913c710001977341,4,Whilst working the lady heard a voice in her head saying if she went now to her church and lit a candle her grandpa would get better.
57a7337e913c710001977341,5,She ignored the voice at first but the message was repeated many times.
57a7337e913c710001977341,6,After a while the lady went to the church despite her lack of faith and before she went in she remembered her grandma’s words that a sincere prayer can work miracles but prayers without faith were useless.
57a7337e913c710001977341,7,The lady whilst unsure lit a candle and knelt at the alter in prayer and asked god to help her grandpa recover and gain his strength and let him have a life again.
57a7337e913c710001977341,8,She went back to the bookstore and continued to shelve books until she felt an overwhelming urge to go home.
57a7337e913c710001977341,9,She locked up the bookstore and went home to find her grandpa in the living room having sat up in bed saying he had the urge to get up.
57a7337e913c710001977341,10,Grandpa recovered and lived for a number of years and then passed away but the extra time with him was fulfilling for the family.
57a7337e913c710001977341,11,The incident happened 20 years ago but has helped the lady in sad and troubled times to help her through.
605ba57d2842d8291b4afd24,1,"The story is about a 22-year-old,"
605ba57d2842d8291b4afd24,2,fresh from college

605ba57d2842d8291b4afd24,4,"She lived with her sister,"
605ba57d2842d8291b4afd24,5,parents
605ba57d2842d8291b4afd24,6,and sick grandfather.
605ba57d2842d8291b4afd24,7,"One day when she was at work,"
605ba57d2842d8291b4afd24,8,"busy shelving,"
605ba57d2842d8291b4afd24,9,"she heard a voice instructing her to go to a church,"
605ba57d2842d8291b4afd24,10,light a candle
605ba57d2842d8291b4afd24,11,and pray for her grandfather.
605ba57d2842d8291b4afd24,12,She looked around
605ba57d2842d8291b4afd24,13,and saw that she was alone in the store
605ba57d2842d8291b4afd24,14,and was shocked.
605ba57d2842d8291b4afd24,15,"She was not particularly a religious person,"
605ba57d2842d8291b4afd24,16,"so this was a bit strange for her,"
605ba57d2842d8291b4afd24,17,but she eventually went to the church
605ba57d2842d8291b4afd24,18,and prayed for her grandfather.
605ba57d2842d8291b4afd24,19,"After praying,"
605ba57d2842d8291b4afd24,20,she went back to the store
605ba57d2842d8291b4afd24,21,"and when she was there,"
605ba57d2842d8291b4afd24,22,had this overwhelming feeling that she needed to go home.
605ba57d2842d8291b4afd24,23,"When she got home,"
605ba57d2842d8291b4afd24,24,she found her grandfather sitting
605ba57d2842d8291b4afd24,25,"and her sister told her that he had gotten out of bed on his own,"
605ba57d2842d8291b4afd24,26,which had not happened in months.
605273bcd0b9b4510724f3d7,1,"Girl 22 years old,"
605273bcd0b9b4510724f3d7,2,sibling (one sister)
605273bcd0b9b4510724f3d7,3,"first job was at a bookstore shelving books,"
605273bcd0b9b4510724f3d7,4,the bookstore was close to a church.
605273bcd0b9b4510724f3d7,5,"Grandpa was poorly and had been bedridden for almost a year,"
605273bcd0b9b4510724f3d7,6,one day she heard a voice telling her to go and light a candle for her grandpa
605273bcd0b9b4510724f3d7,7,and this would make him better.
605273bcd0b9b4510724f3d7,8,She was hesitant as she wasn't really religious
605273bcd0b9b4510724f3d7,9,and remembered things her nan said such as prayers without faith are useless.
605273bcd0b9b4510724f3d7,10,"She ended up going to the church,"
605273bcd0b9b4510724f3d7,11,"finding a candle,"

605273bcd0b9b4510724f3d7,13,Afterwards she went back to work
605273bcd0b9b4510724f3d7,14,but felt a force but no voice telling her to go home.
605273bcd0b9b4510724f3d7,15,When she did go home her grandpa was at home with her sister
605273bcd0b9b4510724f3d7,16,but he was sat up not in bed.

605273bcd0b9b4510724f3d7,18,and was able to stand and walk.
605273bcd0b9b4510724f3d7,19,The grandpa got some of his independence back
605273bcd0b9b4510724f3d7,20,and she often wondered if her prayer at the church has helped.
605273bcd0b9b4510724f3d7,21,They got to enjoy many more years with him
605273bcd0b9b4510724f3d7,22,and he passed a few years later
605273bcd0b9b4510724f3d7,23,but they were all grateful for the extra time they had with him.

611fd5c03b9654834bd4af0e,7,and light a candle for their grandpa.
611fd5c03b9654834bd4af0e,8,"If they do this, it will heal him."
611fd5c03b9654834bd4af0e,9,"After some contemplation, the worker goes to the church,"
611fd5c03b9654834bd4af0e,10,"and although uncertain about their faith, thinks of something their grandma used to say"
611fd5c03b9654834bd4af0e,11,and goes in anyway.
611fd5c03b9654834bd4af0e,12,They make a prayer
611fd5c03b9654834bd4af0e,13,"and light the candle,"
611fd5c03b9654834bd4af0e,14,then return to work.

611fd5c03b9654834bd4af0e,17,"In fact, he lives on for many years"
611fd5c03b9654834bd4af0e,18,and they all get to celebrate his 90th birthday with him.
611fd5c03b9654834bd4af0e,19,"The bookstore worker is thinking about these events 20 years later,"
611fd5c03b9654834bd4af0e,20,and wonders to this day if that candle had anything to do with it.

5f4e826dade9a507a7c6c2d3,2,I worked in a bookstore.

5f4e826dade9a507a7c6c2d3,4,he couldn't get out of bed without help.
5f4e826dade9a507a7c6c2d3,5,My sister and I took care of him.
5f4e826dade9a507a7c6c2d3,6,"One day, while I was working,"
5f4e826dade9a507a7c6c2d3,7,"I heard a voice in my head saying that ""I need to go to the old church and light a candle for my grandpa""."
5f4e826dade9a507a7c6c2d3,8,"I ignored it,"
5f4e826dade9a507a7c6c2d3,9,"but then I heard this voice again, saying the exact same thing."
5f4e826dade9a507a7c6c2d3,10,I felt like i had to go to this church.
5f4e826dade9a507a7c6c2d3,11,I closed the bookstore
5f4e826dade9a507a7c6c2d3,12,and went to the church.
5f4e826dade9a507a7c6c2d3,13,"I wasn't sure if I should do this,"
5f4e826dade9a507a7c6c2d3,14,"because I wasn't a believing person,"
5f4e826dade9a507a7c6c2d3,15,but I did this anyway.
5f4e826dade9a507a7c6c2d3,16,"After that, I went back to work."
5f4e826dade9a507a7c6c2d3,17,"Then I felt this strong urge to go home,"
5f4e826dade9a507a7c6c2d3,18,as if something was pulling me there.
5f4e826dade9a507a7c6c2d3,19,I closed the store
5f4e826dade9a507a7c6c2d3,20,and went to home.
5f4e826dade9a507a7c6c2d3,21,"When I came in,"
5f4e826dade9a507a7c6c2d3,22,I saw my grandpa sitting in the living room with my sister.

5f4e826dade9a507a7c6c2d3,24,that he could stand up by himself.
5f4e826dade9a507a7c6c2d3,25,He lived a long time after this event.
5f4e826dade9a507a7c6c2d3,26,"I still come back in my memories to this day,"
5f4e826dade9a507a7c6c2d3,27,"thinking if my prayers had something to do with ""healing"" my grandpa."
5f4e826dade9a507a7c6c2d3,28,This changed my thinking about faith and prayers.

5dcc6f91e5e18690a20e74d1,6,He took a break from work and walked to the church.
5dcc6f91e5e18690a20e74d1,7,He wasn't a religious person but he remembered his grandmother saying that a prayer could work miracles but a prayer with no faith was useless.
5dcc6f91e5e18690a20e74d1,8,He prayed to God to help his grandfather get better.
5dcc6f91e5e18690a20e74d1,9,He then returned to work.
5dcc6f91e5e18690a20e74d1,10,"A little later he felt a strong urge to go home, there was no voice this time just an urgent feeling to go home."

5dcc6f91e5e18690a20e74d1,12,When he got there he found his grandfather in the living room chatting to his sister and this was the first time he had been able to leave his bed in a long time.

647ba080cdf4db4ed1a2e695,1,Let me tell you a story.
647ba080cdf4db4ed1a2e695,2,I was in college and was working in a bookstore.
647ba080cdf4db4ed1a2e695,3,My grandfather was sick and I have a sister.
647ba080cdf4db4ed1a2e695,4,"While shelving book, I heard a voice telling me that if I want my grandfather to get well, then I have to go to church and pray."
647ba080cdf4db4ed1a2e695,5,"I was not religious, but I went anyway and prayed."
647ba080cdf4db4ed1a2e695,6,I went back to the bookstore and had a feeling to go home.
647ba080cdf4db4ed1a2e695,7,When I went home I saw my grandfather sitting on the couch.
647ba080cdf4db4ed1a2e695,8,"He had never left his bed before, so this surprised me."
647ba080cdf4db4ed1a2e695,9,He lived on for many more years to come.
647ba080cdf4db4ed1a2e695,10,I do not know if my prayer had anything to do with it.
647ba080cdf4db4ed1a2e695,11,"When I feel alone, I remind myself that prayer can work."
5c5ad828903c7700010a4635,1,My story begins when I was 22
5c5ad828903c7700010a4635,2,"and just fresh out of college,"
5c5ad828903c7700010a4635,3,I was working at a bookstore.
5c5ad828903c7700010a4635,4,One day I had an overwhelming urge to go to church
5c5ad828903c7700010a4635,5,and pray
5c5ad828903c7700010a4635,6,and light a candle for my grandpa.
5c5ad828903c7700010a4635,7,There was only 2 siblings myself and my sister
5c5ad828903c7700010a4635,8,who looked after my grandpa
5c5ad828903c7700010a4635,9,as he hadn't been able to do anything without assistance.
5c5ad828903c7700010a4635,10,My parents were out of town for the week.
5c5ad828903c7700010a4635,11,I went to church
5c5ad828903c7700010a4635,12,and prayed to give my grandpa strength.
5c5ad828903c7700010a4635,13,I returned to the bookstore
5c5ad828903c7700010a4635,14,"but had another urge to return to grandpa's house,"
5c5ad828903c7700010a4635,15,when I arrived grandpa was in the lounge talking to my sister
5c5ad828903c7700010a4635,16,she said that he had a sudden surge of energy
5c5ad828903c7700010a4635,17,and strength
5c5ad828903c7700010a4635,18,"and got up and walked to the lounge,"
5c5ad828903c7700010a4635,19,grandpa had been bedbound
5c5ad828903c7700010a4635,20,as he was unable to do anything without assistance.
5c5ad828903c7700010a4635,21,Grandpa lived a few more years until 90
5c5ad828903c7700010a4635,22,that was 20 years ago
5c5ad828903c7700010a4635,23,but I will always remember that praying gives us strength
5c5ad828903c7700010a4635,24,and hope.
5c5ad828903c7700010a4635,25,"Grandma says that prayers are useless if you don't believe,"
5c5ad828903c7700010a4635,26,but strong if you do.

5f3dbd5e99a9be1da93d9039,11,After this he kept recovering
5f3dbd5e99a9be1da93d9039,12,and had a 90th birthday party years later.
5f3dbd5e99a9be1da93d9039,13,He passed a few years after that
5f3dbd5e99a9be1da93d9039,14,and the guy always thought about whether the power of prayer truly helped his grandpa.

60858088111c462ba649ead5,2,Her grandpa had been bedridden for awhile.
60858088111c462ba649ead5,3,"She works in a bookstore when one day she heard someone say 'go to the old church and pray',"
60858088111c462ba649ead5,4,She doesn't believe in religion or faith.
60858088111c462ba649ead5,5,She lives with her sister and grandpa and her parents were away for the weekend.
60858088111c462ba649ead5,6,"Her mother said, if 'you truly believe in something it could become true'."
60858088111c462ba649ead5,7,"That day she went to the old church and prayed,"
60858088111c462ba649ead5,8,She then had a sudden urge to go home and saw her sister speaking to her grandpa and he was better.
60858088111c462ba649ead5,9,Over the years his strength got better and recovered.
60858088111c462ba649ead5,10,It's been twenty years.
60858088111c462ba649ead5,11,She never believed in faith or religion but now she has a feeling that we are not really alone and if we ask for something we can possibly have it.
60858088111c462ba649ead5,12,A couple years later her grandpa passed away.

5629f7f1c8ffc2000f5135a0,6,The young person heard a voice which said he must go to the church to light a candle.
5629f7f1c8ffc2000f5135a0,7,If he did that the grandad would get better.
5629f7f1c8ffc2000f5135a0,8,He did that and went back to the bookshop where he continued to shelve the books.
5629f7f1c8ffc2000f5135a0,9,He than had an urge to go home - no voice this time - where he found his grandad in a chair.
5629f7f1c8ffc2000f5135a0,10,He was told that the grandad had an urge to get out of the bed where he had been for many months.
5629f7f1c8ffc2000f5135a0,11,The grandad continued to get better and lived to 90.

5e39f4be81b2ac0a49f999e6,5,I was going to be a saint.
5e39f4be81b2ac0a49f999e6,6,I went to the church.
5e39f4be81b2ac0a49f999e6,7,I prayed for my grandad to be healed.
5e39f4be81b2ac0a49f999e6,8,I went home.

5d3594902fd5a4001ae58fb9,5,and light a candle
5d3594902fd5a4001ae58fb9,6,so that their grandfather would recover.
5d3594902fd5a4001ae58fb9,7,"The narrator did,"
5d3594902fd5a4001ae58fb9,8,and prayed.
5d3594902fd5a4001ae58fb9,9,His grandfather recovered
5d3594902fd5a4001ae58fb9,10,but died a few years later.
60c7928e14e0a43a43369a5b,1,"when this in college working in a bookstore,"
60c7928e14e0a43a43369a5b,2,he felt a presence urging him to go to the nearby church
60c7928e14e0a43a43369a5b,3,to light a candle for his bed ridden grandpa
60c7928e14e0a43a43369a5b,4,that was home with his sister.
60c7928e14e0a43a43369a5b,5,when he went back to the store after lighting the candle
60c7928e14e0a43a43369a5b,6,that presence urged to go home
60c7928e14e0a43a43369a5b,7,where he found his grandpa sitting in the living room with his sister
60c7928e14e0a43a43369a5b,8,he had gotten out of bed after being bed ridden for a while.
60c7928e14e0a43a43369a5b,9,he died a few years later.
608fd64f1e11fe3f5c0dae08,1,There was a young man
608fd64f1e11fe3f5c0dae08,2,who was fresh out of college
608fd64f1e11fe3f5c0dae08,3,who worked about 5 miles from where he lives at the moment.
608fd64f1e11fe3f5c0dae08,4,He had 1 sibling
608fd64f1e11fe3f5c0dae08,5,who was a girl
608fd64f1e11fe3f5c0dae08,6,who was constantly caring for their frail grandfather
608fd64f1e11fe3f5c0dae08,7,"who was very sick at that time,"
608fd64f1e11fe3f5c0dae08,8,"he didnt even have the strength to leave his bed in his bedroom to move around,"
608fd64f1e11fe3f5c0dae08,9,he had been like this for months.
608fd64f1e11fe3f5c0dae08,10,She was the only person looking after him
608fd64f1e11fe3f5c0dae08,11,as both their parents were out of town
608fd64f1e11fe3f5c0dae08,12,One day as he was packing books onto a bookshelf
608fd64f1e11fe3f5c0dae08,13,"he felt or heard a voice saying to him' You must go to the church down the road, grab a candle, light it and prey for your grandfathers recovery."
608fd64f1e11fe3f5c0dae08,14,The man thought nothing more of the voices
608fd64f1e11fe3f5c0dae08,15,"and continued to pack the shelves,"
608fd64f1e11fe3f5c0dae08,16,however the voices kept repeating the same things over and over again.
608fd64f1e11fe3f5c0dae08,17,He eventually walked a quarter mile down the street to where the church was
608fd64f1e11fe3f5c0dae08,18,and did what the voices said.
608fd64f1e11fe3f5c0dae08,19,"He entered the church, found a candle, lit it and knelt down at the altar."
608fd64f1e11fe3f5c0dae08,20,"He began praying to god,"
608fd64f1e11fe3f5c0dae08,21,however he didn't know how to prey
608fd64f1e11fe3f5c0dae08,22,so he apologized to god
608fd64f1e11fe3f5c0dae08,23,and continued to do as he was told.
608fd64f1e11fe3f5c0dae08,24,He asked god to give his grandfather strength and health.
608fd64f1e11fe3f5c0dae08,25,After this he got up
608fd64f1e11fe3f5c0dae08,26,went back to the bookstore
608fd64f1e11fe3f5c0dae08,27,and carried on packing.
608fd64f1e11fe3f5c0dae08,28,However this time he felt an extremely strong urge to head back home.
608fd64f1e11fe3f5c0dae08,29,He listened to the urge
608fd64f1e11fe3f5c0dae08,30,and locked up the shop.
608fd64f1e11fe3f5c0dae08,31,After speeding home he opened the door
608fd64f1e11fe3f5c0dae08,32,only to see his grampa in the living room out of his room.
608fd64f1e11fe3f5c0dae08,33,After this event the young man always wondered if the prayer had anything to do with his grandfathers recovery.
608fd64f1e11fe3f5c0dae08,34,His grampa lived another 20 years after the event
608fd64f1e11fe3f5c0dae08,35,and eventually died
608fd64f1e11fe3f5c0dae08,36,however leaving his feeling of his presence in their hearts.

5d9f4d5f3cac2b0016c79242,9,and lived for a few more years afterwards living past 90.
5d9f4d5f3cac2b0016c79242,10,This happened to her a few years ago
5d9f4d5f3cac2b0016c79242,11,and she will never forget it.

6072f8908ca848cb61dcce5d,11,The person was not a particularly religious person
6072f8908ca848cb61dcce5d,12,but did so.

6442db170a41e59ffe011949,15,his grandfather was starting to feel better.
6442db170a41e59ffe011949,16,This marked the start of his grandfathers recovery.
60c9fcbb6090f57f63cdbebf,1,A 22 year old man was working in the bookstore.
60c9fcbb6090f57f63cdbebf,2,He had recently finished college.
60c9fcbb6090f57f63cdbebf,3,His grandpa was being looked after by his sister at home.
60c9fcbb6090f57f63cdbebf,4,He was bedridden.
60c9fcbb6090f57f63cdbebf,5,It was a weekend and his parents were not home.
60c9fcbb6090f57f63cdbebf,6,So it was just his sister and him looking after him.
60c9fcbb6090f57f63cdbebf,7,He was shelving books when he heard a voice tell him to go to the church and light a candle for his grandpa.
60c9fcbb6090f57f63cdbebf,8,He looked around and didn't see anyone.
60c9fcbb6090f57f63cdbebf,9,He carried on working but heard the voice again.
60c9fcbb6090f57f63cdbebf,10,He tried to ignore it but then decided to lock up the store and take his break and go the church.
60c9fcbb6090f57f63cdbebf,11,"Whilst walking to the church, which was a short walk away, he remember what his grandma use to say."
60c9fcbb6090f57f63cdbebf,12,A prayer is powerful if sincere but also a prayer without faith is useless.
60c9fcbb6090f57f63cdbebf,13,He wasn't religious but decided to go into the church.
60c9fcbb6090f57f63cdbebf,14,He found a candle and lit it and then knelt in front of the alter and prayed.
60c9fcbb6090f57f63cdbebf,15,"""I don't know how to pray but please make my grandpa well and guide us to help look after him"" or words to that effect."
60c9fcbb6090f57f63cdbebf,16,He went back to the store.
60c9fcbb6090f57f63cdbebf,17,He then felt an urge to go home.
60c9fcbb6090f57f63cdbebf,18,No voices this time just an urge to go home.
60c9fcbb6090f57f63cdbebf,19,He went home and found his grandpa sitting in the living room.
60c9fcbb6090f57f63cdbebf,20,His sister said he suddenly got a surge of energy and got up and walked.
60c9fcbb6090f57f63cdbebf,21,He didn't know whether this had anything to do with his prayer or not but it definitely changed his thinking on how powerful prayer can be.
60c9fcbb6090f57f63cdbebf,22,He grandpa lived for 20 more years and lived to 90 years old and they celebrated their time together.
60c9fcbb6090f57f63cdbebf,23,He had died now a couple of years ago.
60c9fcbb6090f57f63cdbebf,24,But to this day the man still remembers that day clearly and how it has changed his perspective on the power of prayer.
60a3cb60b3e2bdb82a865197,1,A man is recalling an incident
60a3cb60b3e2bdb82a865197,2,that happened almost twenty years ago

60a3cb60b3e2bdb82a865197,5,He was at work packing some bookshelves
60a3cb60b3e2bdb82a865197,6,when he heard a voice say to him
60a3cb60b3e2bdb82a865197,7,that if he went down to the old church
60a3cb60b3e2bdb82a865197,8,and light a candle for his grandfather
60a3cb60b3e2bdb82a865197,9,he would get better.
60a3cb60b3e2bdb82a865197,10,He was not a prayerful person
60a3cb60b3e2bdb82a865197,11,but he remembered his grandmother saying
60a3cb60b3e2bdb82a865197,12,that a prayer made by a faithful person could bring about change.
60a3cb60b3e2bdb82a865197,13,He went home
60a3cb60b3e2bdb82a865197,14,and his grandfather was much better

6318aed60b7ae5e0c899d3ee,2,"She did, even though she wasn't particularly religious,"
6318aed60b7ae5e0c899d3ee,3,"but she remembered her grandma saying that a sincere prayer could perform miracles,"
6318aed60b7ae5e0c899d3ee,4,even though she'd made her fair share of mistakes.
6318aed60b7ae5e0c899d3ee,5,"She lit the candle and returned to the book store,"

6318aed60b7ae5e0c899d3ee,8,"to find her grandpa sitting in a chair,"
6318aed60b7ae5e0c899d3ee,9,"having had a sudden surge of energy to get out of bed,"
6318aed60b7ae5e0c899d3ee,10,which he hadn't done for a long time.
6318aed60b7ae5e0c899d3ee,11,"That was the start of his recovery,"
6318aed60b7ae5e0c899d3ee,12,and she often reflects on that day almost 20 years ago.
6318aed60b7ae5e0c899d3ee,13,"Her grandpa celebrated his 90th birthday surrounded by family,"
6318aed60b7ae5e0c899d3ee,14,"and they cherished every day with him until he died,"

5e349c07e2790c468d9775aa,1,One day I was a young boy
5e349c07e2790c468d9775aa,2,and my sister was caring for my grandpa
5e349c07e2790c468d9775aa,3,who was bedridden.
5e349c07e2790c468d9775aa,4,I was working at a bookstore.
5e349c07e2790c468d9775aa,5,There was only two siblings me and my sister.
5e349c07e2790c468d9775aa,6,One day when I was shelving books
5e349c07e2790c468d9775aa,7,a voice said to me to light a candle at the church for my grandpa
5e349c07e2790c468d9775aa,8,and he would regain his strength.
5e349c07e2790c468d9775aa,9,Although I wasn’t a strong believer
5e349c07e2790c468d9775aa,10,and my grandma said prayer without belief was pointless
5e349c07e2790c468d9775aa,11,I went and lit a candle.
5e349c07e2790c468d9775aa,12,I said despite my misdeeds I was looking for help and strength for my grandpa
5e349c07e2790c468d9775aa,13,to help him.
5e349c07e2790c468d9775aa,14,I then returned to the bookstore to shelve books.
5e349c07e2790c468d9775aa,15,I then felt a strong pull to return home.
5e349c07e2790c468d9775aa,16,No voice just an overwhelming urge.
5e349c07e2790c468d9775aa,17,When I returned home grandpa was sitting in the chair
5e349c07e2790c468d9775aa,18,which he hadn’t done for some time
5e349c07e2790c468d9775aa,19,as he didn’t leave his bed.
5e349c07e2790c468d9775aa,20,My sister he had come over with a surge of energy.
5e349c07e2790c468d9775aa,21,For many years we enjoyed our time together as a family after that.
5e349c07e2790c468d9775aa,22,This was almost twenty years ago.
5e349c07e2790c468d9775aa,23,It has reminded me to keep faith.
5e349c07e2790c468d9775aa,24,My grandpa died a few years later
5e349c07e2790c468d9775aa,25,but we cherished every moment because of this.

60f88d15328d079d8d68fe00,2,working in a bookstore 5 miles from college/university.
60f88d15328d079d8d68fe00,3,"His sister cared for his grandfather,"
60f88d15328d079d8d68fe00,4,who had been bedridden
60f88d15328d079d8d68fe00,5,and required care given by the sister.
60f88d15328d079d8d68fe00,6,"On a weekend,"
60f88d15328d079d8d68fe00,7,"where the guy's parents were away,"
60f88d15328d079d8d68fe00,8,"he was working at the store,"
60f88d15328d079d8d68fe00,9,when he heard a voice tell him
60f88d15328d079d8d68fe00,10,that if he lit a candle at the local church
60f88d15328d079d8d68fe00,11,his grandfather's health would improve
60f88d15328d079d8d68fe00,12,and he would become mobile.
60f88d15328d079d8d68fe00,13,The guy did this
60f88d15328d079d8d68fe00,14,"and prayed,"
60f88d15328d079d8d68fe00,15,then returned to work.
60f88d15328d079d8d68fe00,16,"He got an overwhelming urge to go home,"

60f88d15328d079d8d68fe00,20,and moved himself from his bed to the living room chair unassisted.
60f88d15328d079d8d68fe00,21,"The grandfather's health continued to improve,"
60f88d15328d079d8d68fe00,22,"were he lived and celebrated his 90th birthday,"
60f88d15328d079d8d68fe00,23,but died some years later.
60f88d15328d079d8d68fe00,24,"The guy wonders whether his prayer caused the events to transpire in this way,"
60f88d15328d079d8d68fe00,25,"and is mindful of the power of faith, prayer and belief."
55f821f832af740005172118,1,A man without faith
55f821f832af740005172118,2,decided to pray at church

55f821f832af740005172118,4,to heal

55f821f832af740005172118,6,it worked
55f821f832af740005172118,7,because his grandpa
55f821f832af740005172118,8,got up from his sick bed
55f821f832af740005172118,9,and lived for many more years.

605db73fe547ff7c425f59de,12,since he couldn't move around.
605db73fe547ff7c425f59de,13,"After hearing the voice, she tried to see where it's coming from"
605db73fe547ff7c425f59de,14,but she couldn't find it
605db73fe547ff7c425f59de,15,so she ignored it
605db73fe547ff7c425f59de,16,until it sounded again
605db73fe547ff7c425f59de,17,and this time she decided to take a break
605db73fe547ff7c425f59de,18,and go to the church down the street.
605db73fe547ff7c425f59de,19,She was not a religious person

605db73fe547ff7c425f59de,21,she decided to pray
605db73fe547ff7c425f59de,22,and light the candle wholeheartedly.
605db73fe547ff7c425f59de,23,"After the prayer, she went back to the bookstore"

605db73fe547ff7c425f59de,28,after she got home
605db73fe547ff7c425f59de,29,since her grandpa should have been bedridden at the time.

5803cb9a3073510001231d82,2,My sister cares for our grandpa whilst our parents are out of town.
5803cb9a3073510001231d82,3,One day whilst stacking the shelves with books I hear a voice say to me 'if you go to church & light a candle your grandpa will get better'.
5803cb9a3073510001231d82,4,This 'voice' kept nagging at me.
5803cb9a3073510001231d82,5,So I shut the bookstore & headed to the church.
5803cb9a3073510001231d82,6,I stood a while outside pondering whether to go in.
5803cb9a3073510001231d82,7,"I went in, lit a candle & said a prayer for grandpa."
5803cb9a3073510001231d82,8,I went back to the bookstore & reopened it for a while before a nagging voice in my head told me to go home.
5803cb9a3073510001231d82,9,"I returned home where I was surprised to see grandpa sat up in a chair, something I hadn't seen for a while."
5803cb9a3073510001231d82,10,Grandpa lived for a good few years after.
5803cb9a3073510001231d82,11,"Maybe it was the prayer that helped him get better/more mobile, who knows."
5803cb9a3073510001231d82,12,Do you believe in the power of prayer?

5c78452cac90ae000144bb23,7,"One day,"
5c78452cac90ae000144bb23,8,she heard a voice in her head to pray for her grandpa.
5c78452cac90ae000144bb23,9,She was alone in the bookshop
5c78452cac90ae000144bb23,10,so she knew it was no one in the store.
5c78452cac90ae000144bb23,11,She then went to the church to pray
5c78452cac90ae000144bb23,12,and when she got back home
5c78452cac90ae000144bb23,13,"her grandpa, who normally cannot walk, had energy to walk."
5c78452cac90ae000144bb23,14,This has given her faith in prayer
5c78452cac90ae000144bb23,15,and although her grandpa passed a couple years later
5c78452cac90ae000144bb23,16,it reminds her of how strong faith is.

5a66568a63394a0001558e4d,3,I worked in a bookstore at the time.
5a66568a63394a0001558e4d,4,"Suddenly, I heard a voice in my head that said ""light a candle for your grandpa at the church""."

5a66568a63394a0001558e4d,6,A quarter mile.
5a66568a63394a0001558e4d,7,I had never been a religious man but my grandma had told me the power of faith.
5a66568a63394a0001558e4d,8,"As I entered the church, I knelt and said ""God, I don't know how to pray. but please restore my grandpa to his strength and guide us in looking after him""."
5a66568a63394a0001558e4d,9,I returned to the bookshop after.
5a66568a63394a0001558e4d,10,"Suddenly, I felt a strong urge to return home."
5a66568a63394a0001558e4d,11,I locked up the shop and went home.
5a66568a63394a0001558e4d,12,I was shocked to find my grandpa in the living room talking to my sister.
5a66568a63394a0001558e4d,13,He hadn't left his bed for months without assistance.
5a66568a63394a0001558e4d,14,He lived for many more years and celebrated his ninetieth birthday surrounded by his loved one.
5a66568a63394a0001558e4d,15,He died several years later but his spirit lives on in our hearts.

5ced0ccddfb2720019962226,12,he said he felt sudden surge of energy and strength
5ced0ccddfb2720019962226,13,maybe the prayer and lighting of the candle had worked

615e0a9b470e2794d8318046,2,"He had one sister who looked after his grandfather,"
615e0a9b470e2794d8318046,3,who wasn’t able to look after himself.
615e0a9b470e2794d8318046,4,"One day while shelving books, the boy heard a voice"
615e0a9b470e2794d8318046,5,that told him to go to the church and light a candle for his grandfather.
615e0a9b470e2794d8318046,6,"If he did this, and prayed, his grandfather would regain his strength."
615e0a9b470e2794d8318046,7,His grandfather hadn’t been able to leave his bed for months.
615e0a9b470e2794d8318046,8,The church wasn’t far down the road so the boy went.
615e0a9b470e2794d8318046,9,He found a candle and kneeled down.
615e0a9b470e2794d8318046,10,He wasn’t a very religious person so he started his prayer by saying he wasn’t sure how to pray.
615e0a9b470e2794d8318046,11,He asked for his grandfather to regain his strength.
615e0a9b470e2794d8318046,12,When the boys was back at the book shop he had an overwhelming feeling to go home.
615e0a9b470e2794d8318046,13,So he closed the bookshop and went home.
615e0a9b470e2794d8318046,14,"When he arrived home his grandfather was sitting downstairs,"
615e0a9b470e2794d8318046,15,and he hadn’t been able to leave the bed in months.
615e0a9b470e2794d8318046,16,His grandfather lived for many more years
615e0a9b470e2794d8318046,17,and they all cherished the time they had with him.
615e0a9b470e2794d8318046,18,The boy looked back and wondered did his prayer have anything to do with his grandfather regaining his strength and recovering.
616d8ff5eeb9a8616afa647d,1,"The story takes place some years years ago,"
616d8ff5eeb9a8616afa647d,2,when the storyteller was young.
616d8ff5eeb9a8616afa647d,3,He had a sister.
616d8ff5eeb9a8616afa647d,4,His grandfather was very unwell and was bed ridden.
616d8ff5eeb9a8616afa647d,5,"One day he was working in a bookshop stacking shelves,"
616d8ff5eeb9a8616afa647d,6,when he heard a voice in his head.
616d8ff5eeb9a8616afa647d,7,The voice was telling him to go to the local church and light a candle for his grandfather.
616d8ff5eeb9a8616afa647d,8,"He looked around the store,"
616d8ff5eeb9a8616afa647d,9,but he was alone.
616d8ff5eeb9a8616afa647d,10,He went back to stacking books
616d8ff5eeb9a8616afa647d,11,but he kept on hearing the voice.
616d8ff5eeb9a8616afa647d,12,"Although he was not religious,"
616d8ff5eeb9a8616afa647d,13,he decided to go to the local church and do as the voice said.
616d8ff5eeb9a8616afa647d,14,When he got to the church he said a prayer for this grandfather.
616d8ff5eeb9a8616afa647d,15,He returned to the bookshop and continued to stack shelves.
616d8ff5eeb9a8616afa647d,16,"However, he soon had an overwhelming feeling to return home,"
616d8ff5eeb9a8616afa647d,17,so he locked up the bookshop and went home.
616d8ff5eeb9a8616afa647d,18,When he entered he heard his grandad talking to his sister in the living room.
616d8ff5eeb9a8616afa647d,19,His prayer seemed to have been answered and his grandad got better.
616d8ff5eeb9a8616afa647d,20,He celebrated his ninetieth birthday and died shortly afterwards.
616d8ff5eeb9a8616afa647d,21,The event had a big impact on the storytellers life
616d8ff5eeb9a8616afa647d,22,and from that dat forth he gained faith.
5772b5b39137f30001ebbbb7,1,"Let me tell you a story about when I was twenty two,"
5772b5b39137f30001ebbbb7,2,fresh out of college.
5772b5b39137f30001ebbbb7,3,I was working in a bookstore
5772b5b39137f30001ebbbb7,4,and living with my sister then.
5772b5b39137f30001ebbbb7,5,"My sister was taking care of my grandpa,"
5772b5b39137f30001ebbbb7,6,who was bedridden.
5772b5b39137f30001ebbbb7,7,One day as I was working
5772b5b39137f30001ebbbb7,8,I heard a voice in my head telling me to go to the church yard.
5772b5b39137f30001ebbbb7,9,I am not a particularly religious person.
5772b5b39137f30001ebbbb7,10,I heard the voice again
5772b5b39137f30001ebbbb7,11,and went looking for the church.
5772b5b39137f30001ebbbb7,12,I found the church
5772b5b39137f30001ebbbb7,13,and I prayed.
5772b5b39137f30001ebbbb7,14,After that I went home.
5772b5b39137f30001ebbbb7,15,My sister was there
5772b5b39137f30001ebbbb7,16,and she told me my grandfather had experienced a sudden surge of energy.
5772b5b39137f30001ebbbb7,17,That marked the beginning of his recovery.
5772b5b39137f30001ebbbb7,18,After that he steadily got better
5772b5b39137f30001ebbbb7,19,and made a full recovery.
5772b5b39137f30001ebbbb7,20,That was twenty years ago
5772b5b39137f30001ebbbb7,21,and he went on to live a full life till he passed at the age of ninety.
5772b5b39137f30001ebbbb7,22,That was the beginning of my faith.
5772b5b39137f30001ebbbb7,23,Sometimes when things get tough
5772b5b39137f30001ebbbb7,24,I still look back on that moment
5772b5b39137f30001ebbbb7,25,and remember the power of faith and prayer.
5b9110223366db0001157e7d,1,as a young man
5b9110223366db0001157e7d,2,he had just started his first job
5b9110223366db0001157e7d,3,and a voice inside his head urged him
5b9110223366db0001157e7d,4,to go to the church
5b9110223366db0001157e7d,5,"and light a candle,"
5b9110223366db0001157e7d,6,he did
5b9110223366db0001157e7d,7,and his grandpa recovered.
5b9110223366db0001157e7d,8,This incident made him believe
5b9110223366db0001157e7d,9,in faith
5b9110223366db0001157e7d,10,and prayer.
60199b0a7384e30ddf3a7c55,1,HE WAS 22
60199b0a7384e30ddf3a7c55,2,AND STARTED FIRST JOB IN BOOKSHOP.
60199b0a7384e30ddf3a7c55,3,HIS GRANDA WAS BEDRIDDEN
60199b0a7384e30ddf3a7c55,4,AND WAS BEING CARED FOR BY HIS SISTER.
60199b0a7384e30ddf3a7c55,5,HE HAD A LIGHT BULB MOMENT
60199b0a7384e30ddf3a7c55,6,WHERE HE WAS TOLD TO LIGHT A CANDLE IN THE LOCAL CHURCH
60199b0a7384e30ddf3a7c55,7,AND HIS GRANDPA MIGHT IMPROVE
60199b0a7384e30ddf3a7c55,8,BUT HE WAS ALONE.
60199b0a7384e30ddf3a7c55,9,HE KEPT HEARING THE VOICE.
60199b0a7384e30ddf3a7c55,10,HE TOOK A BREAK
60199b0a7384e30ddf3a7c55,11,AND WENT TO THE CHURCH NOT FAR.
60199b0a7384e30ddf3a7c55,12,AFTER SOME HESITATION
60199b0a7384e30ddf3a7c55,13,"HE ENTERED THE CHURCH,"
60199b0a7384e30ddf3a7c55,14,GOT A CANDLE
60199b0a7384e30ddf3a7c55,15,AND KNELT DOWN
60199b0a7384e30ddf3a7c55,16,AND ASKED FOR HIS GRANDPA TO BE HEALED.
60199b0a7384e30ddf3a7c55,17,HE RETURNED TO THE BOOKSHOP
60199b0a7384e30ddf3a7c55,18,BUT NEEDED TO GO HOME
60199b0a7384e30ddf3a7c55,19,AS HE WAS INSPIRED
60199b0a7384e30ddf3a7c55,20,AND WHEN HE GOT THERE HIS GRANDPA WAS ABLE TO LEAVE HIS BED UNASSISTED.
60199b0a7384e30ddf3a7c55,21,HE FINALLY REGAINED HIS INDEPENDENCE
60199b0a7384e30ddf3a7c55,22,AND CHANGED EVERYONES LIFE FOR THE BETTER
60199b0a7384e30ddf3a7c55,23,AND LIVED INTO HIS NINTIES
60199b0a7384e30ddf3a7c55,24,AND MAYBE PRAYER AND FAITH IS THE ANSWER.
5cfaf97eadb3da00013c1eaa,1,There was a boy who had a sister and a grandpa.
5cfaf97eadb3da00013c1eaa,2,His grandma had died.
5cfaf97eadb3da00013c1eaa,3,His grandpa was very weak.
5cfaf97eadb3da00013c1eaa,4,He could not care for himself.
5cfaf97eadb3da00013c1eaa,5,"Therefore, he worked in the bookstore."
5cfaf97eadb3da00013c1eaa,6,His sister took care of the grandpa.
5cfaf97eadb3da00013c1eaa,7,"One day while at the bookstore, he heard a voice twice."
5cfaf97eadb3da00013c1eaa,8,The voice told him to go to the church.
5cfaf97eadb3da00013c1eaa,9,He was to light a candle and pray for the grandpa.
5cfaf97eadb3da00013c1eaa,10,"On his way, he hesitated."
5cfaf97eadb3da00013c1eaa,11,"But still, he went ahead and prayed a simple prayer for his grandpa's healing."
5cfaf97eadb3da00013c1eaa,12,He was not a particularly religious person.
5cfaf97eadb3da00013c1eaa,13,His grandma always told him prayer should come from a sincere heart.
5cfaf97eadb3da00013c1eaa,14,These were the reasons for his resistance.
5cfaf97eadb3da00013c1eaa,15,"However, back at the bookstore, while resuming his tasks, he felt a strong urge to go home."
5cfaf97eadb3da00013c1eaa,16,"After obliging, he was surprised to find his grandpa sitting in a chair."
5cfaf97eadb3da00013c1eaa,17,His grandpa was chatting with his sister.
5cfaf97eadb3da00013c1eaa,18,This was not normal as he was unable to get up from bed.
5cfaf97eadb3da00013c1eaa,19,Grandpa explained that he felt a surge of energy a while ago.
5cfaf97eadb3da00013c1eaa,20,His sister was happy.
5cfaf97eadb3da00013c1eaa,21,The writer could not believe this had anything to do with his prayer.
5cfaf97eadb3da00013c1eaa,22,"Grandpa, however, made continuous recovery."
5cfaf97eadb3da00013c1eaa,23,He lived a long time after that.
5cfaf97eadb3da00013c1eaa,24,He died at about ninety years in the midst of family and friends.
5cfaf97eadb3da00013c1eaa,25,This taught the writer about faith.
5cfaf97eadb3da00013c1eaa,26,There is another presence with us even though we seem to be alone.
5cfaf97eadb3da00013c1eaa,27,There's always someone looking out for us.
62a1ef4b118ae7c6c666e130,1,The story is about a 22 year old
62a1ef4b118ae7c6c666e130,2,that was hearing voices in their head
62a1ef4b118ae7c6c666e130,3,& also had an ill grandpa.
62a1ef4b118ae7c6c666e130,4,They prayed for their grandpa to get better
62a1ef4b118ae7c6c666e130,5,which he did
62a1ef4b118ae7c6c666e130,6,but he eventually died.
62a1ef4b118ae7c6c666e130,7,The moral of the story was to always have faith
62a1ef4b118ae7c6c666e130,8,& that you’re never alone.
55ad3f2dfdf99b563a2471c8,1,When I was twenty two years old
55ad3f2dfdf99b563a2471c8,2,I was working in a book store.
55ad3f2dfdf99b563a2471c8,3,At the time my grandpa became unwell.
55ad3f2dfdf99b563a2471c8,4,Whilst stacking books in the store
55ad3f2dfdf99b563a2471c8,5,I heard a voice telling me to go to the alter and light a candle for him.
55ad3f2dfdf99b563a2471c8,6,I looked around
55ad3f2dfdf99b563a2471c8,7,but couldn't see anyone
55ad3f2dfdf99b563a2471c8,8,but the voice remained.
55ad3f2dfdf99b563a2471c8,9,"My grandma always told me a prayer from a sincere heart can have a meaningful impact,"
55ad3f2dfdf99b563a2471c8,10,but a prayer from someone with no faith is meaningless.
55ad3f2dfdf99b563a2471c8,11,I know I am not a saint
55ad3f2dfdf99b563a2471c8,12,as I have made many mistakes.
55ad3f2dfdf99b563a2471c8,13,But as I was leaving the store
55ad3f2dfdf99b563a2471c8,14,I felt compelled to turn around and go to pray.
55ad3f2dfdf99b563a2471c8,15,I said my prayer
55ad3f2dfdf99b563a2471c8,16,that I don't know how to pray
55ad3f2dfdf99b563a2471c8,17,but would like support for my grandpa.
55ad3f2dfdf99b563a2471c8,18,Once I returned home
55ad3f2dfdf99b563a2471c8,19,"I was surprised to see my grandpa in the living room,"
55ad3f2dfdf99b563a2471c8,20,my sister told me he had started to recover.
55ad3f2dfdf99b563a2471c8,21,This was the first time I had seen him
55ad3f2dfdf99b563a2471c8,22,as normally he was bedridden
55ad3f2dfdf99b563a2471c8,23,and it marked the start of his recovery.
55ad3f2dfdf99b563a2471c8,24,"I wasn't sure if my prayer had anything to do with his recovery,"
55ad3f2dfdf99b563a2471c8,25,but it did make me reconsider my views on faith.
55ad3f2dfdf99b563a2471c8,26,We then spent as much time as we could with my grandpa
55ad3f2dfdf99b563a2471c8,27,as he made his recovery
55ad3f2dfdf99b563a2471c8,28,and learnt to enjoy the time we had together.
55ad3f2dfdf99b563a2471c8,29,He continued to live on for many years
55ad3f2dfdf99b563a2471c8,30,seeing through his 90th birthday
55ad3f2dfdf99b563a2471c8,31,before passing away peacefully.
634e7e0695471fa84bfe5f2f,1,Started working at a bookstore straight out of college at 22 years old.
634e7e0695471fa84bfe5f2f,2,Grandpa was sick.
634e7e0695471fa84bfe5f2f,3,"Only two siblings, me and my sister to look after him."
634e7e0695471fa84bfe5f2f,4,"Heard a voice in my head to go to the church,"
634e7e0695471fa84bfe5f2f,5,Light a candle
634e7e0695471fa84bfe5f2f,6,And pray for his grandpa to get better and recover.
634e7e0695471fa84bfe5f2f,7,Not religious but went to church anyway
634e7e0695471fa84bfe5f2f,8,And lit and candle
634e7e0695471fa84bfe5f2f,9,And prayed.
634e7e0695471fa84bfe5f2f,10,Went back to the bookstore
634e7e0695471fa84bfe5f2f,11,And had overwhelming feeling that he needed to go home.
634e7e0695471fa84bfe5f2f,12,Went home
634e7e0695471fa84bfe5f2f,13,And grandpa was out of bed
634e7e0695471fa84bfe5f2f,14,And sitting in the living room with my sister.
634e7e0695471fa84bfe5f2f,15,He hadn't gotten out of bed for months without assistance.
634e7e0695471fa84bfe5f2f,16,This was the start of his recovery.
634e7e0695471fa84bfe5f2f,17,Got better
634e7e0695471fa84bfe5f2f,18,And lived until 90 before passing away recently.
634e7e0695471fa84bfe5f2f,19,Made me think of the power of faith.
60dcc945f7ee60621d36b715,1,The author is in his twenties
60dcc945f7ee60621d36b715,2,and was working in a bookstore.
60dcc945f7ee60621d36b715,3,His grandfather was poorly
60dcc945f7ee60621d36b715,4,and living with him
60dcc945f7ee60621d36b715,5,and his parents
60dcc945f7ee60621d36b715,6,and his parents are away for the weekend.
60dcc945f7ee60621d36b715,7,When he was at work
60dcc945f7ee60621d36b715,8,he had a voice say to his to go to the church
60dcc945f7ee60621d36b715,9,"and he felt compelled to go,"
60dcc945f7ee60621d36b715,10,even though he had no strong faith.
60dcc945f7ee60621d36b715,11,He tells how his grandmother used to say something about no prayer is wasted
60dcc945f7ee60621d36b715,12,but also that a prayer without conviction was worth less-
60dcc945f7ee60621d36b715,13,or words to that effect.
60dcc945f7ee60621d36b715,14,He went to the church
60dcc945f7ee60621d36b715,15,and said to God he didn't really know how to pray
60dcc945f7ee60621d36b715,16,but that he was praying for his grandfather's healing.
60dcc945f7ee60621d36b715,17,He returned to work
60dcc945f7ee60621d36b715,18,but when there felt a strong urge that he must return home.
60dcc945f7ee60621d36b715,19,So he closed up the bookstore
60dcc945f7ee60621d36b715,20,and went home.
60dcc945f7ee60621d36b715,21,"On getting home, he was surprised to find his grandfather sat up in the living room,"
60dcc945f7ee60621d36b715,22,"talking with his sister,"
60dcc945f7ee60621d36b715,23,as he had been bedridden for months prior to the.
60dcc945f7ee60621d36b715,24,His sister told him that he just suddenly had the energy to get up.
60dcc945f7ee60621d36b715,25,The author muses whether his visit to the church has anything to do with this.
60dcc945f7ee60621d36b715,26,"From then on, his grandfather continues to gain strength"
60dcc945f7ee60621d36b715,27,and return to his health
60dcc945f7ee60621d36b715,28,and lived for many years into his 90s.
60dcc945f7ee60621d36b715,29,This story became a something of a family legend
60dcc945f7ee60621d36b715,30,and lives strong in the authors memory.
5f7760d025023628ce3f4d05,1,"A man 22 years old, fresh out of college is looking after his ill grandpa with his sister at their family home"
5f7760d025023628ce3f4d05,2,while his parents are out of town.
5f7760d025023628ce3f4d05,3,He has a job at a bookstore
5f7760d025023628ce3f4d05,4,"and whilst working, hears an imaginary voice telling him to go to the church and light a candle."
5f7760d025023628ce3f4d05,5,"He does it, despite not really believing it,"
5f7760d025023628ce3f4d05,6,"but thinking about what his grandma used to say, he goes anyway."

5f7760d025023628ce3f4d05,9,When he gets home his grandpa is sitting in the lounge
5f7760d025023628ce3f4d05,10,despite not being able to get out of bed for months.
5f7760d025023628ce3f4d05,11,His grandpa lived a few more years after that.
5f7760d025023628ce3f4d05,12,The writer is recalling the story from 20 years ago.
64528c575f51539110be524a,1,Let me share a story when I was twenty years old.
64528c575f51539110be524a,2,I finished my school and started a job.
64528c575f51539110be524a,3,We are two siblings and a grandpa.
64528c575f51539110be524a,4,"Our grandpa was bedridden,"
64528c575f51539110be524a,5,He could not move on his own.
64528c575f51539110be524a,6,"One day, I felt someone saying to me go down to the church and pray."
64528c575f51539110be524a,7,I had ignored that many times
64528c575f51539110be524a,8,But one day I felt an urge to go there.
64528c575f51539110be524a,9,I was not a religious person.
64528c575f51539110be524a,10,"I went to the church,"
64528c575f51539110be524a,11,"Knelt down,"
64528c575f51539110be524a,12,And say a prayer to God to recover my grandpa and give him a healthy life so he could move.
64528c575f51539110be524a,13,I have heard that prayer from the heart with strong belief never goes unheard
64528c575f51539110be524a,14,And prayer without a belief is never heard.
64528c575f51539110be524a,15,"So, said a prayer and went home."
64528c575f51539110be524a,16,"When I went home, to my surprise my sister told me that Grandpa suddenly felt some unbelievable energy"
64528c575f51539110be524a,17,And he stood up without any support.
64528c575f51539110be524a,18,"That day, made my belief strong that no prayer goes wasted."
64528c575f51539110be524a,19,Grandpa lived so many years with spirit and health.

5e9883baf93c610a951f26e7,1,I am 22 years old
5e9883baf93c610a951f26e7,2,"and I was walking to the bookstore,"
5e9883baf93c610a951f26e7,3,where I work.
5e9883baf93c610a951f26e7,4,"At home, I have a grandpa"
5e9883baf93c610a951f26e7,5,and a sister.
5e9883baf93c610a951f26e7,6,My grandpa is bedbound
5e9883baf93c610a951f26e7,7,and is not in a good state.
5e9883baf93c610a951f26e7,8,My sister looks after him.
5e9883baf93c610a951f26e7,9,"While shelving, I heard a noise in my head"
5e9883baf93c610a951f26e7,10,"""Come to the church and pray for your grandpa"
5e9883baf93c610a951f26e7,11,"and he will get better""."
5e9883baf93c610a951f26e7,12,I looked around
5e9883baf93c610a951f26e7,13,and nobody was there.
5e9883baf93c610a951f26e7,14,I closed the bookstore
5e9883baf93c610a951f26e7,15,and walked to the church
5e9883baf93c610a951f26e7,16,which was a quarter of a mile away.
5e9883baf93c610a951f26e7,17,On the way I remembered my grandma's words.
5e9883baf93c610a951f26e7,18,I am not particularly religious
5e9883baf93c610a951f26e7,19,but she said that prayers with a sincere heart come true.
5e9883baf93c610a951f26e7,20,"On the other hand, she said prayers without faith were useless."
5e9883baf93c610a951f26e7,21,In the church I prayed for my grandpa to get better.
5e9883baf93c610a951f26e7,22,I left
5e9883baf93c610a951f26e7,23,and went back to shelving at the bookstore.
5e9883baf93c610a951f26e7,24,I then felt the sudden urge to leave
5e9883baf93c610a951f26e7,25,and go home
5e9883baf93c610a951f26e7,26,so I locked up
5e9883baf93c610a951f26e7,27,and went home.
5e9883baf93c610a951f26e7,28,"When I arrived, I found my grandpa sitting in the chair in the living room"
5e9883baf93c610a951f26e7,29,"talking to my sister,"
5e9883baf93c610a951f26e7,30,which was a surprise because he was bedbound for the last few years.
5e9883baf93c610a951f26e7,31,My sister said he felt a sudden urge of energy
5e9883baf93c610a951f26e7,32,and managed to get out of bed.
5e9883baf93c610a951f26e7,33,That marked the first day of his recovery.
5e9883baf93c610a951f26e7,34,He lived until his 90th birthday in good health.
5e9883baf93c610a951f26e7,35,That was 20 years ago
5e9883baf93c610a951f26e7,36,and he died several years later.
5e9883baf93c610a951f26e7,37,Sometimes now when I think about it
5e9883baf93c610a951f26e7,38,I am reminded that we are not alone
5e9883baf93c610a951f26e7,39,even when it may appear we are.
5e8e5058e690d70ebefeb033,1,"Man lives with his grandpa and his sister,"
5e8e5058e690d70ebefeb033,2,his grandpa is bed ridden
5e8e5058e690d70ebefeb033,3,and is recovering from illness.
5e8e5058e690d70ebefeb033,4,His parents are out for the weekend.
5e8e5058e690d70ebefeb033,5,"He works at a library 20 miles away from the town,"
5e8e5058e690d70ebefeb033,6,"whilst working he was urged by a voice in his head to go the local church and light a candle,"
5e8e5058e690d70ebefeb033,7,he kept putting back the thought
5e8e5058e690d70ebefeb033,8,but it kept repeating over and over
5e8e5058e690d70ebefeb033,9,till he decided to go to the local church.
5e8e5058e690d70ebefeb033,10,Once at the local church he said that his grandma used to have a strong faith
5e8e5058e690d70ebefeb033,11,and that she would say prayers work but only for those with faith.
5e8e5058e690d70ebefeb033,12,He prayed to god for his grandpa to recover.
5e8e5058e690d70ebefeb033,13,"He felt a strong urge to go home and check on his grandpa,"
5e8e5058e690d70ebefeb033,14,so he immediately went home
5e8e5058e690d70ebefeb033,15,and found his grandpa sitting in the living room talking to his sister.
5e8e5058e690d70ebefeb033,16,He had managed to get up on his own
5e8e5058e690d70ebefeb033,17,and that became the start of his grandpas long recovery.
5e8e5058e690d70ebefeb033,18,"The grandpa lived to celebrate his 90th birthday surrounded by all the family,"
5e8e5058e690d70ebefeb033,19,until he passed away a few years later
5e8e5058e690d70ebefeb033,20,and the memories with the grandpa are cherished by him.
5e8e5058e690d70ebefeb033,21,He is now a man with stronger faith
5e8e5058e690d70ebefeb033,22,"and believes in the power of faith and miracles,"
5e8e5058e690d70ebefeb033,23,and tells us that we are never alone.
5ac68755fa3b4e0001737f38,1,The narrator was working in a bookstore.
5ac68755fa3b4e0001737f38,2,Their sister was at home caring for their bedridden grandpa.
5ac68755fa3b4e0001737f38,3,"Suddenly, a voice in their head said go and pray for your grandpa and he will get better."
5ac68755fa3b4e0001737f38,4,The narrator went to the church.
5ac68755fa3b4e0001737f38,5,"They explained how skeptical they were about the power of prayer,"
5ac68755fa3b4e0001737f38,6,but after some time they conceded
5ac68755fa3b4e0001737f38,7,and even though they said they did not know how to pray
5ac68755fa3b4e0001737f38,8,they pray for their grandpa's recovery.
5ac68755fa3b4e0001737f38,9,They then went home
5ac68755fa3b4e0001737f38,10,and their grandpa was no longer bedridden
5ac68755fa3b4e0001737f38,11,and it was the start of his recovery.
5ac68755fa3b4e0001737f38,12,"Their grandpa died a few years later,"
5ac68755fa3b4e0001737f38,13,but 20 years later the narrator still feels the power of prayer.

634e9bff0e8c21e97c621cb1,5,He hears the voice again
634e9bff0e8c21e97c621cb1,6,and decides to take a break.
634e9bff0e8c21e97c621cb1,7,"Arriving at the church he questions his faith,"
634e9bff0e8c21e97c621cb1,8,"and as he's not overly religious,"
634e9bff0e8c21e97c621cb1,9,would his prayer make things better or worse based on his grandmother's advice.
634e9bff0e8c21e97c621cb1,10,He prays
634e9bff0e8c21e97c621cb1,11,and returns to work.
634e9bff0e8c21e97c621cb1,12,Later he gets an overwhelming urge to go home.
634e9bff0e8c21e97c621cb1,13,"Locks up,"
634e9bff0e8c21e97c621cb1,14,goes home to find his grandad sitting in the living room after getting a surge of energy.
634e9bff0e8c21e97c621cb1,15,"That was the start of his recovery,"
634e9bff0e8c21e97c621cb1,16,and he regained his independence & strength.

63bda8bbe64ce816bb0e37e2,3,He heard a voice at the bookstore
63bda8bbe64ce816bb0e37e2,4,that told him to light a candle for his grandpa
63bda8bbe64ce816bb0e37e2,5,and he would get better.
63bda8bbe64ce816bb0e37e2,6,The man went to the church to pray
63bda8bbe64ce816bb0e37e2,7,and light the candle.
63bda8bbe64ce816bb0e37e2,8,The man went back to the bookstore to work.
63bda8bbe64ce816bb0e37e2,9,The man went back home to find his grandpa better.
63bda8bbe64ce816bb0e37e2,10,The man's sister told him he had recovered.
63bda8bbe64ce816bb0e37e2,11,The grandpa lived longer
63bda8bbe64ce816bb0e37e2,12,but eventually died.
5e4464d23e28c82e888fa598,1,I was 22 just out of college
5e4464d23e28c82e888fa598,2,"and I started working with my grandad at our bookstore,"
5e4464d23e28c82e888fa598,3,he quickly became very ill
5e4464d23e28c82e888fa598,4,and bedridden
5e4464d23e28c82e888fa598,5,one day when working
5e4464d23e28c82e888fa598,6,I heard a voice whisper
5e4464d23e28c82e888fa598,7,and say that if I went to the local church
5e4464d23e28c82e888fa598,8,and lit a candle
5e4464d23e28c82e888fa598,9,"my grandad would be fine,"
5e4464d23e28c82e888fa598,10,although no one was around when I looked.
5e4464d23e28c82e888fa598,11,"I remembered my grandma saying that prayers made with good hearts could create miracles,"
5e4464d23e28c82e888fa598,12,I was no saint
5e4464d23e28c82e888fa598,13,but what harm could it do.
5e4464d23e28c82e888fa598,14,"So I went to the church with a candle,"
5e4464d23e28c82e888fa598,15,praying that he was alright.
5e4464d23e28c82e888fa598,16,"I got the feeling to suddenly go home,"
5e4464d23e28c82e888fa598,17,Grandad was out of bed looking much better.
5e4464d23e28c82e888fa598,18,He ended up living many years more
5e4464d23e28c82e888fa598,19,"and celebrating his 90th birthday,"
5e4464d23e28c82e888fa598,20,the whole experience was 20 years ago
5e4464d23e28c82e888fa598,21,but gave me a much different perspective on religion and prayer.
62fba19b31689f425e047e01,1,"This Young Lady bookstore keeper,"
62fba19b31689f425e047e01,2,her grandpa's got seriously ill.

62fba19b31689f425e047e01,4,arranging the shelves'.... etc.
62fba19b31689f425e047e01,5,She suddenly heard a voice urging her to go to Church to make some prayer's.
62fba19b31689f425e047e01,6,The inner voice was telling her that if she done so her Grandpa's would certainly become well.
62fba19b31689f425e047e01,7,She followed the instructions accordingly and done so.
62fba19b31689f425e047e01,8,"Moreover, after she prayed got back to her store"
62fba19b31689f425e047e01,9,and then she had that strong urge and emotions telling her to head back home now!!
62fba19b31689f425e047e01,10,She went back home
62fba19b31689f425e047e01,11,she found her grandpa's sitting with her sister having a chin-wag
62fba19b31689f425e047e01,12,she become well and fit like a horse.

62fba19b31689f425e047e01,14,"the whole family become more religious,"
62fba19b31689f425e047e01,15,grateful to life

5841a2d39d65770001cebfa1,2,My sister at home caring for my bedridden grandpa.
5841a2d39d65770001cebfa1,3,It is just me and my sister.
5841a2d39d65770001cebfa1,4,I hear a voice urging me to go to the church and light a candle and my Grandpa will recover.
5841a2d39d65770001cebfa1,5,I go to the Church and even though I'm not religious and have made many mistakes in my life I light a candle and say a prayer.
5841a2d39d65770001cebfa1,6,My Grandmother said a prayer from a genuine heart can make miracles but also that a prayer without faith was meaningless.
5841a2d39d65770001cebfa1,7,I then return to the shop.
5841a2d39d65770001cebfa1,8,I feel an urge to go home.
5841a2d39d65770001cebfa1,9,When I get there my Grandpa is sat in the living room.
5841a2d39d65770001cebfa1,10,My sister said he felt a surge of energy which helped to get him out of bed.
5841a2d39d65770001cebfa1,11,I wondered if it was the lighting of the candle.
5841a2d39d65770001cebfa1,12,My Grandpa lived to be 90 and celebrated his birthday surrounded by family and friends.
5841a2d39d65770001cebfa1,13,I recall that day 20 years ago which helped me cherish the time I had with my family.
