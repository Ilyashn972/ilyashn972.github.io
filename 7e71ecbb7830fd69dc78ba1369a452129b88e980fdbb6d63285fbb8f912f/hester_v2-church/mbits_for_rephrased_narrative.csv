Whilst stacking books in the store I heard a voice telling me to go to the alter and light a candle for him. I looked around but couldn't see anyone but the voice remained. My grandma always told me a prayer from a sincere heart can have a meaningful impact, but a prayer from someone with no faith is meaningless. I know I am not a saint as I have made many mistakes. But as I was leaving the store I felt compelled to turn around and go to pray. I said my prayer that I don't know how to pray but would like support for my grandpa. Once I returned home I was surprised to see my grandpa in the living room, my sister told me he had started to recover. This was the first time I had seen him as normally he was bedridden and it marked the start of his recovery. I wasn't sure if my prayer had anything to do with his recovery, but it did make me reconsider my views on faith.
