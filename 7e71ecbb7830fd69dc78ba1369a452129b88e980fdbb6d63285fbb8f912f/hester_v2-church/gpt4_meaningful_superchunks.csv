"(1, 8)","Let me share a story from when I was twenty-two years old, just fresh out of college. I was staying in a small town about five miles from here. I had just started my first job at a local bookstore. It was a quiet afternoon, and I was alone in the store. My grandpa, who had been bedridden for almost a year, was at home with my sister. She had to care for him daily, as he couldn't move around on his own. There were only two of us siblings, my sister and me. My parents had gone out of town for the weekend.",Owen's solitary contemplation is interrupted by a startling noise
"(9, 11)","As I was shelving books, I suddenly heard a voice inside my head. It said, ""If you go to the old church down the street and light a candle for your grandpa, he will get better."" I looked around the bookstore, but no one was there.","Investigating the disturbance, Owen finds it's just a deer"
