My sister cares for our grandpa whilst our parents are out of town. One day whilst stacking the shelves with books I hear a voice say to me 'if you go to church & light a candle your grandpa will get better'. This 'voice' kept nagging at me. So I shut the bookstore & headed to the church. I stood a while outside pondering whether to go in. I went in, lit a candle & said a prayer for grandpa. I went back to the bookstore & reopened it for a while before a nagging voice in my head told me to go home. I returned home where I was surprised to see grandpa sat up in a chair, something I hadn't seen for a while. Grandpa lived for a good few years after. Maybe it was the prayer that helped him get better/more mobile, who knows. Do you believe in the power of prayer?"

They heard a voice twice in their head (no one was there) telling them to go to church and pray/light a candle for their sick Grandpa. They hesitated as they weren't religious but remembered their Grandma said a sincere prayer could help. Eventually they went in the church and prayed/lit a candle. When they went home their Grandpa was feeling better and it marked a turning point in his recovery. He has now died but celebrated his ninetieth birthday and was around for many months after the incident. The event gave the narrator more faith.

I was working at a bookstore. There was only two siblings me and my sister. One day when I was shelving books a voice said to me to light a candle at the church for my grandpa and he would regain his strength. Although I wasn’t a strong believer and my grandma said prayer without belief was pointless I went and lit a candle. I said despite my misdeeds I was looking for help and strength for my grandpa to help him. I then returned to the bookstore to shelve books. I then felt a strong pull to return home. No voice just an overwhelming urge. When I returned home grandpa was sitting in the chair which he hadn’t done for some time as he didn’t leave his bed. My sister he had come over with a surge of energy. For many years we enjoyed our time together as a family after that. This was almost twenty years ago. It has reminded me to keep faith. My grandpa died a few years later but we cherished every moment because of this.

My sister and I were caring for our Grandpa while our parents were out of town. While working I heard a voice in my head saying to visit the church down the road and say a prayer. It repeated itself and I walked to the church after remembering my Grandma's words about prayers being answered if they were from a sincere heart. I went to the church and told God I didn't know how to pray but asked for help for my Grandpa. After work I went home and found him out of bed where he had been for months. He gained more strength and independence and celebrated his 90th birthday with family. He lived for many years after this. This happened over 20 years ago and I recall the feeling I had for faith and prayer and how it can bring about miracles.

One day, I felt someone saying to me go down to the church and pray. I had ignored that many times But one day I felt an urge to go there. I was not a religious person. I went to the church, Knelt down, And say a prayer to God to recover my grandpa and give him a healthy life so he could move. I have heard that prayer from the heart with strong belief never goes unheard And prayer without a belief is never heard. So, said a prayer and went home. When I went home, to my surprise my sister told me that Grandpa suddenly felt some unbelievable energy And he stood up without any support. That day, made my belief strong that no prayer goes wasted. Grandpa lived so many years with spirit and health."

I lived with my younger sister and my grandpa, and recently he'd became ill. Very ill. Eventually becoming bedridden and continuing to decline. One night while stacking shelves at work I hear a voice in my mind - telling me to go to the Church nearby, and light a candle: this would help my grandpa get better. I had reservations as I was far from religious but I went to the Church about a quarter mile away, found, and lit a candle. I suddenly felt an inescapable urge to go home, which I gave in to only to see Grandpa, who had been bedridden remember, up and walking. He'd, that night, felt a rush of energy and every night after got better and better, living for many many years afterwards. He made it to ninety. I still think back to that night very often, and wonder whether my act of lighting that candle and giving a prayer really made a difference or not. Either way it changed my whole outlook on faith."
