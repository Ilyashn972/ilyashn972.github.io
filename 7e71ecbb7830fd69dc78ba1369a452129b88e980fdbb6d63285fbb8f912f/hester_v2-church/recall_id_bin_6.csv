One day when I was at store packing book on shelves, I heard a voice saying "" if you go to the church and light a candle for your grandpa, he will get better"". I turned around to see who was there but there was no one. I continued packing the books on the shelves till I heard the voice again. I turned around again but still there was no one. I then left the store and made my way to the church. About a quarter mile away, I stopped and pondered. I was not a religious person but my grandmother used to say prayer from a sincere heart can bring miracles, but she said prayer without faith is useless. Finally I went inside and lit the candle and prayed. I went back to the store and had a strong urge to go back home. There no voices this time, just an overwhelming feeling. I immediately locked up the store and went home. I walked in to find my grandpa sitting in the dining room with my sister. He had been bedding for months but he suddenly had a burst of energy and was able to get up without assistance. I wondered if my prayer had."
