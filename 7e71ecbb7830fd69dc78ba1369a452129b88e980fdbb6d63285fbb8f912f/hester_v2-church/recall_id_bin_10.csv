His grandpa was unable to care for himself and was looked after his granddaughter. While working at the bookstore, our lead heard a voice that told him to go to church and light a candle. Having heard the voice, he decided to go there on his break. While at the church, he pondered and hesitated weighing up the push and pull of his decision; him not being religious but also how his mom stated you if you don't believe in faith, it won't work. Our character tried it and prayed; and miraculously, his grandpa could talk for the first time in years. It was the start of his recovery and led to many more years of his life before he passed. The 22 year old then had believed in faith more that day."

He looked around and didn't see anyone. He carried on working but heard the voice again. He tried to ignore it but then decided to lock up the store and take his break and go the church. Whilst walking to the church, which was a short walk away, he remember what his grandma use to say. A prayer is powerful if sincere but also a prayer without faith is useless. He wasn't religious but decided to go into the church. He found a candle and lit it and then knelt in front of the alter and prayed. ""I don't know how to pray but please make my grandpa well and guide us to help look after him"" or words to that effect. He went back to the store. He then felt an urge to go home. No voices this time just an urge to go home. He went home and found his grandpa sitting in the living room. His sister said he suddenly got a surge of energy and got up and walked. He didn't know whether this had anything to do with his prayer or not but it definitely changed his thinking on how powerful prayer can be. He grandpa lived for 20 more years and lived to 90 years old and they celebrated their time together. He had died now a couple of years ago. But to this day the man still remembers that day clearly and how it has changed his perspective on the power of prayer."

While I was working I heard a voice in my head telling me to go to the local church and light a candle and say a prayer for my grandpa's health. I looked around but no one else had spoken. I carried on working but heard the voice again. I'm not particularly religious and I remember my grandma saying if you're sincere about saying a prayer it will be more effective. If you're not then it wont. I'm not a saint but I decided to go to the church. I locked up the shop, walked to the church and lit a candle and said a prayer. I prayed for my grandpa's health and recovery. I left the church and went back to the shop. As I was stacking books I had a sudden urge to go home. It was like something was pulling me to the house. There was no voice this time. I shut the shop and I went home. To my surprise my grandpa was sat in a chair in the living room talking to my sister. He hadn't been able to get out of bed for some time. My sister told me earlier on he'd had a sudden surge of energy and had felt able to get out of bed and walk. That was the start of my grandpa's recovery. He slowly got better and was able to live independently again. We treasured every moment with him. He went on to live many more years and celebrated his ninetieth birthday surrounded by his family. He passed away a few years after that but we were grateful for every moment we had with him. I don't know if his recovery was influenced by my prayer but I often think about that moment. It changed my perspective on faith and the power of it. That incident was twenty years ago but I often think about it. It's still a vivid memory for me. It made me think about the power of faith and prayer and made think that we are never truly alone."

I was twenty-two years old, fresh out of college. I was staying in a small town about five miles from here. I had just started my first job at a local bookstore. It was a quiet afternoon, and I was alone in the store. My grandpa, who had been bedridden for almost a year, was at home with my sister. She had to care for him daily, as he couldn't move around on his own. There were only two of us siblings, my sister and me. My parents had gone out of town for the weekend. As I was shelving books, I suddenly heard a voice inside my head. It said, ""If you go to the old church down the street and light a candle for your grandpa, he will get better."" I looked around the bookstore, but no one was there. I continued with my work, trying to ignore the voice. It spoke to me again, repeating the same message. I looked around once more, but still found no one. I decided to take a break and walk to the church. I was only a short distance away, maybe a quarter-mile. As I approached the church, I hesitated for a moment. I was not a religious person. I remembered my grandma always saying that prayers from a sincere heart could bring miracles. On the other hand, she also said that prayers without faith were useless. I admitted to myself that I was far from being a saint. I had my share of mistakes and misdeeds. I thought about my grandpa and how much he meant to our family. Finally, I went inside the church and found a candle. I knelt down in front of the altar. I said, ""God, I don't know how to pray properly. But I am asking you with all my heart to heal my grandpa. Please help him regain his strength and guide us in taking care of him."" After saying a prayer, I returned to the bookstore. I resumed my work, shelving books. Suddenly, I felt a strong urge to go home. It was as if something was pulling me towards the house. I didn't hear any voice this time. It was just an overwhelming feeling that I needed to go home. I locked up the store and rushed home. To my surprise, I found my grandpa sitting in the living room, talking to my sister. He hadn't been able to leave his bed for months without assistance. My sister told me that he had suddenly felt a surge of energy and was able to stand up and walk. That day started the beginning of his recovery. He gradually regained his strength and independence. It was a turning point in our lives. We became more grateful for the time we had together. I often thought back to that day in the church. I wondered if my prayer had anything to do with my grandpa's recovery. I couldn't be sure, but it definitely changed my perspective on faith and the power of prayer.

That experience happened almost twenty years ago. It remains a vivid memory in my mind. My grandpa passed away a few years later, but his spirit lives on in our hearts. Sometimes, when I'm feeling lost or uncertain, I think back to that day. I remember the power of faith and the miracles it can bring. And I am reminded that we are never truly alone, even when it seems like we are."
