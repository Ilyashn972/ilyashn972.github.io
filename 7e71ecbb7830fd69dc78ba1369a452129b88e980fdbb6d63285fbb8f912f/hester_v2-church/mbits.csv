All of a sudden, the bookstore worker hears a voice saying to go down to the nearby church and light a candle for their grandpa. If they do this, it will heal him. After some contemplation, the worker goes to the church, and although uncertain about their faith, thinks of something their grandma used to say and goes in anyway. They make a prayer and light the candle, then return to work. Once back in the shop, they feel a strong urge to go back home. Once there, they see their grandpa is all better. In fact, he lives on for many years and they all get to celebrate his 90th birthday with him. The bookstore worker is thinking about these events 20 years later, and wonders to this day if that candle had anything to do with it.",4.74,1.35,3.51,-2.28,23.74,-1.61,-1.56,6.78,6.98,21.28,0.11,-0.21,0.74,0.79,0.35,-0.99,1.78,0.89,4.85,1.35,-0.07,-2.69,-1.5,1.15,-1.29,-1.36,0.29,-2.07,-1.5,0.91,8.71,1.62,0.05,0.61,-0.5,4.25,-5.99,0.38,-0.42,-1.09,-2.03,-1.41,-2.03,1.8,-1.41,1.95,4.9,-0.43,0.74,-0.68,-5.24,-1.74,0.09,-2.95

Although I wasn’t a strong believer and my grandma said prayer without belief was pointless I went and lit a candle. I said despite my misdeeds I was looking for help and strength for my grandpa to help him. I then returned to the bookstore to shelve books. I then felt a strong pull to return home. No voice just an overwhelming urge. When I returned home grandpa was sitting in the chair which he hadn’t done for some time as he didn’t leave his bed. My sister he had come over with a surge of energy. For many years we enjoyed our time together as a family after that. This was almost twenty years ago. It has reminded me to keep faith.

I prayed for my grandpa's health and recovery. I left the church and went back to the shop. As I was stacking books I had a sudden urge to go home. It was like something was pulling me to the house. There was no voice this time. I shut the shop and I went home. To my surprise my grandpa was sat in a chair in the living room talking to my sister. He hadn't been able to get out of bed for some time. My sister told me earlier on he'd had a sudden surge of energy and had felt able to get out of bed and walk. That was the start of my grandpa's recovery. He slowly got better and was able to live independently again. We treasured every moment with him. He went on to live many more years and celebrated his ninetieth birthday surrounded by his family. He passed away a few years after that but we were grateful for every moment we had with him. I don't know if his recovery was influenced by my prayer but I often think about that moment. It changed my perspective on faith and the power of it. That incident was twenty years ago but I often think about it. It's still a vivid memory for me. It made me think about the power of faith and prayer and made think that we are never truly alone.",18.02,-3.76,7.4,-1.73,21.59,2.31,6.47,5.85,8.88,10.05,2.64,2.1,1.08,-1.36,1.04,-1.77,-0.62,1.31,10.4,10.66,7.08,-3.14,-1.04,-0.1,-5.27,-2.74,-0.03,1.92,4.15,4.46,9.57,5.68,8.72,-1.6,1.19,11.19,-0.39,6.68,2.32,3.8,-1.56,-1.05,-4.19,1.72,4.3,3.28,7.52,0.6,3.46,3.33,-2.05,-1.8,-0.02,2.3

5de16fd00e58661bb3519db8,906.46,0.28,"Let me share a story. I was twenty-two years old, fresh out of college. I was staying in a small town about five miles from here. I had just started my first job at a local bookstore. It was a quiet afternoon, and I was alone in the store. My grandpa, who had been bedridden for almost a year, was at home with my sister. She had to care for him daily, as he couldn't move around on his own. There were only two of us siblings, my sister and me. My parents had gone out of town for the weekend. As I was shelving books, I suddenly heard a voice inside my head. It said, ""If you go to the old church down the street and light a candle for your grandpa, he will get better."" I looked around the bookstore, but no one was there. I continued with my work, trying to ignore the voice. It spoke to me again, repeating the same message. I looked around once more, but still found no one. I decided to take a break and walk to the church. I was only a short distance away, maybe a quarter-mile. As I approached the church, I hesitated for a moment. I was not a religious person. I remembered my grandma always saying that prayers from a sincere heart could bring miracles. On the other hand, she also said that prayers without faith were useless. I admitted to myself that I was far from being a saint. I had my share of mistakes and misdeeds. I thought about my grandpa and how much he meant to our family. Finally, I went inside the church and found a candle. I knelt down in front of the altar. I said, ""God, I don't know how to pray properly. But I am asking you with all my heart to heal my grandpa. Please help him regain his strength and guide us in taking care of him."" After saying a prayer, I returned to the bookstore. I resumed my work, shelving books. Suddenly, I felt a strong urge to go home. It was as if something was pulling me towards the house. I didn't hear any voice this time. It was just an overwhelming feeling that I needed to go home. I locked up the store and rushed home. To my surprise, I found my grandpa sitting in the living room, talking to my sister. He hadn't been able to leave his bed for months without assistance. My sister told me that he had suddenly felt a surge of energy and was able to stand up and walk. That day started the beginning of his recovery. He gradually regained his strength and independence. It was a turning point in our lives. We became more grateful for the time we had together. I often thought back to that day in the church. I wondered if my prayer had anything to do with my grandpa's recovery. I couldn't be sure, but it definitely changed my perspective on faith and the power of prayer. My grandpa lived for many more years after that incident. He celebrated his ninetieth birthday surrounded by family and friends. We cherished every moment we had with him. That experience happened almost twenty years ago. It remains a vivid memory in my mind. My grandpa passed away a few years later, but his spirit lives on in our hearts. Sometimes, when I'm feeling lost or uncertain, I think back to that day. I remember the power of faith and the miracles it can bring. And I am reminded that we are never truly alone, even when it seems like we are.",28.38,27.1,13.05,13.77,45.4,30.26,19.96,15.41,17.28,38.23,15.05,15.1,13.09,18.0,9.83,27.61,11.01,4.71,33.79,28.89,24.99,17.68,18.63,16.67,12.19,19.02,12.53,25.47,6.15,14.18,14.66,11.87,13.98,3.57,5.68,18.58,20.37,19.26,5.33,10.31,10.7,14.11,15.97,9.47,18.01,12.49,12.34,6.92,17.56,9.48,20.13,13.86,10.34,18.04
