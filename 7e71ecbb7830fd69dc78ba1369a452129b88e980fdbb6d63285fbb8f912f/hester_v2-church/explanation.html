            Analyze a narrative that has been split into clauses, with each clause assigned two scores. These scores are typically
            correlated but occasionally deviate. Focus on identifying and analyzing clauses where the two scores are not correlated.
            Provide insights into potential reasons for these deviations. Ensure all output is provided in markdown format.
