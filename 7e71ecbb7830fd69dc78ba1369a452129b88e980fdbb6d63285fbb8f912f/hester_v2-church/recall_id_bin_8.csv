His grandma had died. His grandpa was very weak. He could not care for himself. Therefore, he worked in the bookstore. His sister took care of the grandpa. One day while at the bookstore, he heard a voice twice. The voice told him to go to the church. He was to light a candle and pray for the grandpa. On his way, he hesitated. But still, he went ahead and prayed a simple prayer for his grandpa's healing. He was not a particularly religious person. His grandma always told him prayer should come from a sincere heart. These were the reasons for his resistance. However, back at the bookstore, while resuming his tasks, he felt a strong urge to go home. After obliging, he was surprised to find his grandpa sitting in a chair. His grandpa was chatting with his sister. This was not normal as he was unable to get up from bed. Grandpa explained that he felt a surge of energy a while ago. His sister was happy. The writer could not believe this had anything to do with his prayer. Grandpa, however, made continuous recovery. He lived a long time after that. He died at about ninety years in the midst of family and friends. This taught the writer about faith. There is another presence with us even though we seem to be alone. There's always someone looking out for us."

He thought it was a prank and looked around but didn't see anyone else there, but the voice kept repeating. He left work to go to the church and tried it. He remembered his grandma saying ""prayers from the heart can bring miracles"". He lit a candle and said a prayer that admitted he doesn't do it often but he would like his grandpa to get better. He went back to work and continued his job, but had a sudden urge to go home. The storyteller went home to follow the urge and when he got home his grandpa was sitting upright on the couch. He was astonished as his grandpa had never been able to do so for around a year. He thinks back to the day in the church and if it played a role in his grandpa's recovery. His grandpa had to be around 70 at the time as they spent another 20 years together from that moment. Ever since that moment, the storyteller has believed in faith."

I ignored it, but then I heard this voice again, saying the exact same thing. I felt like i had to go to this church. I closed the bookstore and went to the church.
