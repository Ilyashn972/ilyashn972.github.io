5629f7f1c8ffc2000f5135a0,"A person was working in a bookshop near to the home. He was 22. He had just one sister who was caring for the grandad, who was bed ridden, as the parents were out of town. The young person heard a voice which said he must go to the church to light a candle. If he did that the grandad would get better. He did that and went back to the bookshop where he continued to shelve the books. He than had an urge to go home - no voice this time - where he found his grandad in a chair. He was told that the grandad had an urge to get out of the bed where he had been for many months. The grandad continued to get better and lived to 90.",628,69.98177735307056,0.11
630492ce98f024b7188676df,"The person was 22 years old working in a book store. Their grandpa was bedridden. The person thought they heard voices saying go to church but no one was in the store. They locked up and went to church to pray even though they weren't really religious. They prayed for their grandpa to get better. They went back to work then felt the urge to go home. At home the grandpa had felt a surge of energy and got out of bed alone, the first time in months and said he felt better. He gradually recovered and lived to celebrate his 90th birthday. This happened 20 years ago and the narrator said they still think about it when they are losing faith.",642,48.67763047692252,0.08
5803cb9a3073510001231d82,"22 years old working in a bookstore shelving books. My sister cares for our grandpa whilst our parents are out of town. One day whilst stacking the shelves with books I hear a voice say to me 'if you go to church & light a candle your grandpa will get better'. This 'voice' kept nagging at me. So I shut the bookstore & headed to the church. I stood a while outside pondering whether to go in. I went in, lit a candle & said a prayer for grandpa. I went back to the bookstore & reopened it for a while before a nagging voice in my head told me to go home. I returned home where I was surprised to see grandpa sat up in a chair, something I hadn't seen for a while. Grandpa lived for a good few years after. Maybe it was the prayer that helped him get better/more mobile, who knows. Do you believe in the power of prayer?",820,64.68304451592253,0.08
5841a2d39d65770001cebfa1,Working in a bookshop after college. My sister at home caring for my bedridden grandpa. It is just me and my sister. I hear a voice urging me to go to the church and light a candle and my Grandpa will recover. I go to the Church and even though I'm not religious and have made many mistakes in my life I light a candle and say a prayer. My Grandmother said a prayer from a genuine heart can make miracles but also that a prayer without faith was meaningless. I then return to the shop. I feel an urge to go home. When I get there my Grandpa is sat in the living room. My sister said he felt a surge of energy which helped to get him out of bed. I wondered if it was the lighting of the candle. My Grandpa lived to be 90 and celebrated his birthday surrounded by family and friends. I recall that day 20 years ago which helped me cherish the time I had with my family.,867,101.07809757529554,0.12
57a7337e913c710001977341,Lady was working in her book store shelving books. She is one of two siblings the other being her sister. Her sister looked after their grandpa who had been bedridden for many months and had to be assisted with moving around and looking after him. Whilst working the lady heard a voice in her head saying if she went now to her church and lit a candle her grandpa would get better. She ignored the voice at first but the message was repeated many times. After a while the lady went to the church despite her lack of faith and before she went in she remembered her grandmaâ€™s words that a sincere prayer can work miracles but prayers without faith were useless. The lady whilst unsure lit a candle and knelt at the alter in prayer and asked god to help her grandpa recover and gain his strength and let him have a life again. She went back to the bookstore and continued to shelve books until she felt an overwhelming urge to go home. She locked up the bookstore and went home to find her grandpa in the living room having sat up in bed saying he had the urge to get up. Grandpa recovered and lived for a number of years and then passed away but the extra time with him was fulfilling for the family. The incident happened 20 years ago but has helped the lady in sad and troubled times to help her through.,1304,103.90837497032655,0.08
