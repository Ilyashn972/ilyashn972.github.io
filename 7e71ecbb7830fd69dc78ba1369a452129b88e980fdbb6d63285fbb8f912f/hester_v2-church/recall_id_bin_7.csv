I was working in a bookstore and living with my sister then. My sister was taking care of my grandpa, who was bedridden. One day as I was working I heard a voice in my head telling me to go to the church yard. I am not a particularly religious person. I heard the voice again and went looking for the church. I found the church and I prayed. After that I went home. My sister was there and she told me my grandfather had experienced a sudden surge of energy. That marked the beginning of his recovery. After that he steadily got better and made a full recovery. That was twenty years ago and he went on to live a full life till he passed at the age of ninety. That was the beginning of my faith. Sometimes when things get tough I still look back on that moment and remember the power of faith and prayer."

I go to the Church and even though I'm not religious and have made many mistakes in my life I light a candle and say a prayer. My Grandmother said a prayer from a genuine heart can make miracles but also that a prayer without faith was meaningless. I then return to the shop. I feel an urge to go home. When I get there my Grandpa is sat in the living room. My sister said he felt a surge of energy which helped to get him out of bed. I wondered if it was the lighting of the candle. My Grandpa lived to be 90 and celebrated his birthday surrounded by family and friends. I recall that day 20 years ago which helped me cherish the time I had with my family.

She was the only person looking after him as both their parents were out of town One day as he was packing books onto a bookshelf he felt or heard a voice saying to him' You must go to the church down the road, grab a candle, light it and prey for your grandfathers recovery. The man thought nothing more of the voices and continued to pack the shelves, however the voices kept repeating the same things over and over again. He eventually walked a quarter mile down the street to where the church was and did what the voices said. He entered the church, found a candle, lit it and knelt down at the altar. He began praying to god, however he didn't know how to prey so he apologized to god and continued to do as he was told. He asked god to give his grandfather strength and health. After this he got up went back to the bookstore and carried on packing. However this time he felt an extremely strong urge to head back home. He listened to the urge and locked up the shop. After speeding home he opened the door only to see his grampa in the living room out of his room. After this event the young man always wondered if the prayer had anything to do with his grandfathers recovery. His grampa lived another 20 years after the event and eventually died however leaving his feeling of his presence in their hearts."

At the time my grandpa became unwell. Whilst stacking books in the store I heard a voice telling me to go to the alter and light a candle for him. I looked around but couldn't see anyone but the voice remained. My grandma always told me a prayer from a sincere heart can have a meaningful impact, but a prayer from someone with no faith is meaningless. I know I am not a saint as I have made many mistakes. But as I was leaving the store I felt compelled to turn around and go to pray. I said my prayer that I don't know how to pray but would like support for my grandpa. Once I returned home I was surprised to see my grandpa in the living room, my sister told me he had started to recover. This was the first time I had seen him as normally he was bedridden and it marked the start of his recovery. I wasn't sure if my prayer had anything to do with his recovery, but it did make me reconsider my views on faith. We then spent as much time as we could with my grandpa as he made his recovery and learnt to enjoy the time we had together. He continued to live on for many years seeing through his 90th birthday When I was twenty two years old"
