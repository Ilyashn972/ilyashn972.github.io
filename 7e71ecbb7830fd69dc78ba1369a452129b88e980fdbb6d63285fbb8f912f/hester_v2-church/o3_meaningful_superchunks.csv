"(1, 8)","Let me share a story from when I was twenty-two years old, just fresh out of college. I was staying in a small town about five miles from here. I had just started my first job at a local bookstore. It was a quiet afternoon, and I was alone in the store. My grandpa, who had been bedridden for almost a year, was at home with my sister. She had to care for him daily, as he couldn't move around on his own. There were only two of us siblings, my sister and me. My parents had gone out of town for the weekend.",I work alone at a bookstore while my sister tends our bedridden grandpa
"(9, 14)","As I was shelving books, I suddenly heard a voice inside my head. It said, ""If you go to the old church down the street and light a candle for your grandpa, he will get better."" I looked around the bookstore, but no one was there. I continued with my work, trying to ignore the voice. It spoke to me again, repeating the same message. I looked around once more, but still found no one.",A persistent inner voice urges me to light a healing candle for grandpa
"(15, 21)","I decided to take a break and walk to the church. I was only a short distance away, maybe a quarter-mile. As I approached the church, I hesitated for a moment. I was not a particularly religious person. I remembered my grandma always saying that prayers from a sincere heart could bring miracles. On the other hand, she also said that prayers without faith were useless. I admitted to myself that I was far from being a saint.","Walking to the church, I wrestle with doubt and my shaky faith"
"(22, 28)","I had my share of mistakes and misdeeds. I thought about my grandpa and how much he meant to our family. Finally, I went inside the church and found a candle. I knelt down in front of the altar. I said, ""God, I don't know how to pray properly. But I am asking you with all my heart to heal my grandpa. Please help him regain his strength and guide us in taking care of him.""","Out of love, I light a candle and pray earnestly for grandpa’s recovery"
"(29, 34)","After saying my prayer, I returned to the bookstore. I resumed my work, shelving books. Suddenly, I felt a strong urge to go home. It was as if something was pulling me towards the house. I didn't hear any voice this time. It was just an overwhelming feeling that I needed to go.","Back at work, an irresistible pull makes me lock up and rush home"
"(35, 42)","I locked up the store and rushed home. To my surprise, I found my grandpa sitting in the living room, talking to my sister. He hadn't been able to leave his bed for months without assistance. My sister told me that he had suddenly felt a surge of energy and was able to stand up and walk. That day marked the beginning of his recovery. He gradually regained his strength and independence. It was a turning point in our lives. We became more grateful for the time we had together.","We find grandpa miraculously mobile, marking the start of his recovery and our gratitude"
"(43, 48)","I often thought back to that day in the church. I wondered if my prayer had anything to do with my grandpa's recovery. I couldn't be sure, but it definitely changed my perspective on faith and the power of prayer. My grandpa lived for many more years after that incident. He celebrated his ninetieth birthday surrounded by family and friends. We cherished every moment we had with him.",I reflect on the possible miracle and deepen my sense of faith as grandpa thrives
"(49, 54)","That experience happened almost twenty years ago. It remains a vivid memory in my mind. My grandpa passed away a few years later, but his spirit lives on in our hearts. Sometimes, when I'm feeling lost or uncertain, I think back to that day. I remember the power of faith and the miracles it can bring. And I am reminded that we are never truly alone, even when it seems like we are.","Years later, that memory still guides me and reminds me I’m never alone"
