My grandpa was very sick. I worked in a bookstore at the time. Suddenly, I heard a voice in my head that said ""light a candle for your grandpa at the church"". I was only a short distance from the church. A quarter mile. I had never been a religious man but my grandma had told me the power of faith. As I entered the church, I knelt and said ""God, I don't know how to pray. but please restore my grandpa to his strength and guide us in looking after him"". I returned to the bookshop after. Suddenly, I felt a strong urge to return home. I locked up the shop and went home. I was shocked to find my grandpa in the living room talking to my sister. He hadn't left his bed for months without assistance. He lived for many more years and celebrated his ninetieth birthday surrounded by his loved one. He died several years later but his spirit lives on in our hearts."
