A sunny summer afternoon in a forest by a calm, serene lake. Two young women in their early 20s with blonde hair are visible. The narrator, wearing a plain white t-shirt and white shorts, is at the edge of the lake, being playfully pushed by her friend. Her body is tipping forward with a surprised and laughing expression as she begins to lose balance towards the water. Her best friend, wearing a plain blue t-shirt and blue shorts, stands behind her with one arm extended from the nudge, looking mischievous. The forest is lush and green, sunlight dappled on the ground. The lake reflects the clear blue sky, completing the lively, cheerful scene of a summer camping trip.
