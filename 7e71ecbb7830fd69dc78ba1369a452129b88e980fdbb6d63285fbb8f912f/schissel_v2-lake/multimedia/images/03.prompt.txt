A sunny summer afternoon at a calm lake with clear blue sky. A young woman in her early 20s with blonde hair, wearing a wet plain white t-shirt and white shorts, is emerging knee-deep from the lake. Water drips from her hair and clothes as she looks to her best friend with laughter on her face. Her best friend, also blonde and in her early 20s, stands at the water's edge in a plain blue t-shirt and blue shorts, holding a small green frog with a playful grin. The forest backdrop is lush and green with sunlight filtering through, and the scene is filled with the sounds of splashing water and birds singing, reflecting the joyful, carefree nature of a summer camping trip.
