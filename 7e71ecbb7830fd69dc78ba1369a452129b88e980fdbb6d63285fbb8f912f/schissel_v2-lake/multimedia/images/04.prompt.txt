A sunny summer afternoon at a serene lake with clear blue sky. Two young women in their early 20s with blonde hair stand at the edge of the water. The narrator, wearing a wet plain white t-shirt and white shorts, stands with a playful, mischievous grin as water drips from her clothes, suggesting a lighthearted threat of future revenge. Her best friend, in a plain blue t-shirt and blue shorts, faces her, still holding a small green frog, her expression a mix of mock fear and laughter. The lush, green forest, with sunlight filtering through leaves and the sound of birds, enhances their joyous and teasing camaraderie, reflecting the playful spirit of a summer day with friends.
