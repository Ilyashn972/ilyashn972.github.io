1,86,90,20.02,My best friend pushed me into the lake.
2,80,69,3.34,This happened during our annual summer camping trip
3,39,25,1.57,and we were enjoying a peaceful afternoon.
4,12,8,3.85,"The reason it all began,"

6,39,28,1.86,- this was at our favorite spot in the woods -

8,62,56,2.47,I had just sat down to eat my sandwich
9,54,56,-0.19,and I told her I wasn't interested.
10,39,30,1.13,"'Course friends, y'know, they don't always take no for an answer."

17,66,31,0.63,"And naturally, the first thing to do was to get revenge,"
18,76,66,5.76,"and I said, ""Just you wait,"" I said, ""you'll get yours soon enough."""
