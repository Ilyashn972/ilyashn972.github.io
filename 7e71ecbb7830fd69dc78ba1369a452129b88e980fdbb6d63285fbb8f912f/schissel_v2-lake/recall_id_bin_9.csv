She had asked me to catch a frog. I had just sat down to eat my lunch. So I said no. Course friends don't always take no for an answer. So she crept up behind me. And pushed me into the lake. I saw on the shore a frog. Which she picked up. And handed to me. I couldn't help but laugh. Uncontrollably.
