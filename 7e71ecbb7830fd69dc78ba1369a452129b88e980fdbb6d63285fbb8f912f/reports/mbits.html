    <h4> Meaningful bits.</h4>

    Below are results related to meaningful bits.
    
    If not stated otherwise meaningful bits is difference between sum of logp for segments.
    The difference is calculated by substracting sum of logp probalibities of the narrative from sum of logp probabilities with 
    narrative preceeded by recall.<hr>

        <a href="../recall_meaningful_bits.html"> Meaningful bits of recall</a><br>
        <p>CSV files with values for each segment of the narrative. <br>
        They also have a columns with total sum for full recall, and rate (sum/len(in chars))<br>
        They also have a row for mean values.<br>

    First results for one recall for each story. Averages: hit (max segment was mapped to) 71%,
    was mapped to the first segment 55%, which means that if mapped correctly, it will go to the first segment in 77% of the
    cases.
