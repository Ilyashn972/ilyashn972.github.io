I was living in a small apartment outside of the city centre. My father lived nearby with a live in nurse. My younger sister was away in college so it was just the two of them. My father was in a wheelchair and couldn't do a lot by himself. One day I was at work in the office and I got this feeling that if I prayed for my father to get better then it would work. It was an overwhelming feeling so I looked around the office to see if I could leave to go to the local park. Nobody was around so I walked the ten minutes over and sat underneath the oak tree. I looked up at the branches swaying and I got that feeling to pray again. So I asked God to make my father better. That day I got a text from my father saying ""I just took three steps with my walker"". He had not been able to move without any assistance before then so I took it as a sign that my prayer worked. This was seven or eight years ago and now he can walk without any assistance at all and lives life to the fullest."

They lived in the city and had an apartment. Their dad hadn't been well and hadn't left the house for eight months. The storyteller worried about their father when they were at work. All he had for company was a kind neighbour. One day, when at work she got a feeling. The feeling seemed to suggest that if they went to the local park and prayed their father would be healed. She looked around the office and saw no one else was there and walked to the park. The park was about a 10 minute walk away. They looked around again to see if there was anyone watching. They sat under the oak tree and prayed to God. 'God if you are listening, please help my father to recover'. They had always been told that prayers could come true so they saw no harm in trying. When they returned to work, they got a message from their father which said he had just taken some steps. The storyteller went to be with him and found him standing up, able to take a few steps with his walker. He improved and now 6 or 7 years later is fully recovered and lives life to the fullest in his seventies."

My father hadn't been very well and was being cared for at home by his neighbour who was a kind lady. I looked around the office and there was no one around so I went to the park. I found a bench and sat down under an oak tree. I closed my eyes and prayed for my father to recover quickly. I returned to the office and received a call from my father saying he had taken a few steps today. I was joyful because I knew my prayers had been answered. When I got home, I saw my father standing there with his frame taking more steps. It's 7 years later and my father is now living his life to the full and walking with full mobility which is good as he is now in his 70s and living life to the fullest."

I got the same strong feeling again and found a bench under a tree to sit on. I looked around and closed my eyes praying, please God, help my dad recover so he can have his life back. I then went back to the office and I received a message from my dad telling me that he started taking small steps. I rushed home to find my dad standing with the aid of his walking stick.

When I got back to the office I took a call from my father and he said he'd taken his first steps with his walker which he hadn't been able to do before. I went home and he was standing using the walker, he improved from then on and within a year he could walk unaided and and was living a good life. My prayers had been answered."
