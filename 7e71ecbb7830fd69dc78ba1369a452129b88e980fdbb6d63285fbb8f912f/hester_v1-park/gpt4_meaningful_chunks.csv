"(7, 9)","The only person there with him during the day was a kind neighbor, a lady in her sixties. My younger sister was away at college – so it was just my dad and the neighbor lady at home during the day.",A neighbor cared for my dad while I was away
"(10, 11)","One day, I got this strong feeling while I was at work. It told me: ""If you go to the nearby park during your lunch break and pray for your father's recovery, he'll start to improve.""",A strong feeling urged me to pray for my dad

"(20, 23)","I wasn't too far from my office, maybe a ten-minute walk. I found a bench to sit on and closed my eyes – uh – uh – that feeling came back once more. I just took a deep breath.",I sat under an oak tree to pray for my dad
"(24, 26)",I was sitting under a big oak tree now. I looked up at the branches above me. Nobody was around.,"I looked up at the branches, alone with my thoughts"

"(31, 34)",I'd admit that to anyone. But I was willing to give it a try. I looked around one more time and then I closed my eyes,I was determined to try praying for his recovery
"(35, 38)","and said a quiet prayer. I whispered, ""God, I don't know if you're listening. But I ask you to please help my father recover. So he can regain his independence and enjoy life again.""",I prayed for my father's independence and joy
"(39, 40)",I opened my eyes and went back to work.,I returned to work after praying
