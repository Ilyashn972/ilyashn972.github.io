During the day his father, that was recovering from an operation at home, was looked after by a neighbour. He saw no one else during the day, couldn't walk and hadn't been out of the house in about 7 months. The guy at work had an urge to pray for his dad's recovery, so during his lunch break he went to a local park, sat under an oak tree on a bench and said a short prayer, that God would help his father recover more quickly from the surgery. When our praying guy got back to the office he got a text from his father saying that he had taken a few steps with his walker. When the guy got home his father was standing with the aid of his walker. Now his father is almost entirely recovered and walks unaided, and is well in his 70s. The praying thing happened about 7 years ago."

After about a year, I was at work when I had a strange feeling that told me to go to the local park in my lunch hour and pray for my father's recovery. I looked around the office, no-one was taking any notice of me, and so at lunchtime I decided to go to the park as I'd been told. Again, I had the same feeling, that I should pray. I didn't see anyone in the park. I am not a believer in prayers, but decided to give it a try. I sat on a bench under an oak tree and closed my eyes. I said ""Please God, help my father to recover."" Shortly afterwards I received a text from my father who said that he had taken a few steps with his walker. He couldn't believe it. After work, I rushed round to see my father and there he was, standing on the steps with his walker. It was the first time he had been able to take any steps for six or seven years. He gradually improved and now after eight years he is able to walk again and lead a full life."
