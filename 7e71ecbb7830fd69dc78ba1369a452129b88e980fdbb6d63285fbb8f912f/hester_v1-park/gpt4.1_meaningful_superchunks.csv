"(1, 8)","Let me share a story from when I was twenty-one years old. I was living in a small apartment near the city center. I had just started my first job. And uh I was working as a graphic designer. My father, who was recovering from a surgery, hadn't been out in – in uh – well I'd say about eight months. He had to use a wheelchair to get around. The only person there with him during the day was a kind neighbor, a lady in her sixties. My younger sister was away at college –","I begin my story, describing my early adulthood and my father's difficult recovery at home"
"(9, 16)","so it was just my dad and the neighbor lady at home during the day. One day, I got this strong feeling while I was at work. It told me: ""If you go to the nearby park during your lunch break and pray for your father's recovery, he'll start to improve."" I looked around my office. I didn't see anyone nearby. So, I went to the park during my break and found a quiet spot there. That feeling came back again.","With my sister away, I sense a strong urge at work to pray for my father's healing and head to the park"
"(17, 24)","I looked around once more. I still didn't see anyone nearby but I decided to take a chance. I wasn't too far from my office, maybe a ten-minute walk. I found a bench to sit on and closed my eyes – uh – uh – that feeling came back once more. I just took a deep breath. I was sitting under a big oak tree now.","Alone in the park, I reflect, find a quiet spot, and prepare myself to pray"
"(25, 32)","I looked up at the branches above me. Nobody was around. And uh I said to myself, well now, I had been taught that prayers can make a difference. And that it doesn't hurt to try. I knew I wasn't perfect, but I wanted to help my dad. I'd admit that to anyone. But I was willing to give it a try.","I recall my beliefs about prayer and resolve to try, hoping to help my father"
"(33, 40)","I looked around one more time and then I closed my eyes and said a quiet prayer. I whispered, ""God, I don't know if you're listening. But I ask you to please help my father recover. So he can regain his independence and enjoy life again."" I opened my eyes and went back to work.","I look around, close my eyes, and offer a heartfelt prayer for my father's recovery"
"(41, 48)","Suddenly, I received a text message from my father. It said, ""I just took a few steps with my walker."" I – I couldn't believe it. It felt like a sign that my prayer had been heard. I rushed home after work and saw my father standing in the living room with the help of his walker. He hadn't been able to do that in months without assistance. And there he was, taking small steps.","After praying, I receive news of my father's progress and witness his first steps at home"
"(49, 54)","That was the turning point in his recovery. He continued to improve and regained most of his mobility within a year. It's been, what, six or seven years since then? My father is now able to walk without any assistance. He's living life to the fullest, even in his seventies.","My father's recovery accelerates, and years later he thrives with regained independence"
