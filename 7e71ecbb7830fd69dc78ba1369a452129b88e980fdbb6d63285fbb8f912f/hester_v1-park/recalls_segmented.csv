63ebbd2e45a16584b49227f1,10,"It told me: ""If you go to the nearby park during your lunch break and pray for your father's recovery, he'll start to improve."""
63ebbd2e45a16584b49227f1,11,I looked around my office.
63ebbd2e45a16584b49227f1,12,I didn't see anyone nearby.
63ebbd2e45a16584b49227f1,13,"So, I went to the park during my break and found a quiet spot there."

63ebbd2e45a16584b49227f1,17,"I wasn't too far from my office, maybe a ten-minute walk."
63ebbd2e45a16584b49227f1,18,I found a bench to sit on and closed my eyes feeling came back once more.

63ebbd2e45a16584b49227f1,22,Wanted to help my dad give it a try.
63ebbd2e45a16584b49227f1,23,Closed my eyes and said a quiet prayer.
63ebbd2e45a16584b49227f1,24,"I whispered, ""God, I don't know if you're listening. But I ask you to please help my father recover. So he can enjoy life again."

63ebbd2e45a16584b49227f1,26,"Suddenly,received a text message from my father."
63ebbd2e45a16584b49227f1,27,"It said, ""I just took a few steps with my walker."""

63ebbd2e45a16584b49227f1,30,Rushed home and saw my father standing in the living room.
63ebbd2e45a16584b49227f1,31,"And there he was, taking small steps."

5ea015577dd57200089eb811,6,and he felt he was being told to pray for his father in his lunch break.

5ea015577dd57200089eb811,8,there was no one else around
5ea015577dd57200089eb811,9,and sat on a bench under a big oak tree
5ea015577dd57200089eb811,10,and closed his eyes to ask God to help his father regain his independence.
5ea015577dd57200089eb811,11,Shortly after his father rang him to say he had taken a few steps with his walker which he had not managed before.
5ea015577dd57200089eb811,12,He rushed home after work

608489b0f443591db476893d,1,A man was in his office
608489b0f443591db476893d,2,and he got an overwhelming feeling

608489b0f443591db476893d,4,who was recovering from surgery.
608489b0f443591db476893d,5,His dad was often alone
608489b0f443591db476893d,6,as his daughter was away
608489b0f443591db476893d,7,"however, his 60 year old neighbour would often visit."
608489b0f443591db476893d,8,The man went to the park
608489b0f443591db476893d,9,and prayed in a quiet spot
608489b0f443591db476893d,10,and he got a call from his father
608489b0f443591db476893d,11,saying he could stand using his walker
608489b0f443591db476893d,12,which he had not been able to do for quite some time.

608489b0f443591db476893d,14,and now 6-7 years later

5fae55f1c1b83f2c4d05540d,1,Let me tell you a story about when I was twenty one.
5fae55f1c1b83f2c4d05540d,2,I was living in a small apartment outside of the city centre.
5fae55f1c1b83f2c4d05540d,3,My father lived nearby with a live in nurse.
5fae55f1c1b83f2c4d05540d,4,My younger sister was away in college so it was just the two of them.
5fae55f1c1b83f2c4d05540d,5,My father was in a wheelchair and couldn't do a lot by himself.
5fae55f1c1b83f2c4d05540d,6,One day I was at work in the office and I got this feeling that if I prayed for my father to get better then it would work.
5fae55f1c1b83f2c4d05540d,7,It was an overwhelming feeling so I looked around the office to see if I could leave to go to the local park.
5fae55f1c1b83f2c4d05540d,8,Nobody was around so I walked the ten minutes over and sat underneath the oak tree.
5fae55f1c1b83f2c4d05540d,9,I looked up at the branches swaying and I got that feeling to pray again.
5fae55f1c1b83f2c4d05540d,10,So I asked God to make my father better.
5fae55f1c1b83f2c4d05540d,11,"That day I got a text from my father saying ""I just took three steps with my walker""."
5fae55f1c1b83f2c4d05540d,12,He had not been able to move without any assistance before then so I took it as a sign that my prayer worked.
5fae55f1c1b83f2c4d05540d,13,This was seven or eight years ago and now he can walk without any assistance at all and lives life to the fullest.

59ef45d37f3d71000171e3a7,14,and went to the park.
59ef45d37f3d71000171e3a7,15,I looked around
59ef45d37f3d71000171e3a7,16,and there was still nobody around
59ef45d37f3d71000171e3a7,17,so i sat down on a bench under a big oak tree.
59ef45d37f3d71000171e3a7,18,I looked up at the branches and leaves
59ef45d37f3d71000171e3a7,19,and prayed.
59ef45d37f3d71000171e3a7,20,"I said. "" if you are listening God, please help my father recover."""
59ef45d37f3d71000171e3a7,21,I went back to work
59ef45d37f3d71000171e3a7,22,where i received a text message from my father saying he had just taken a few steps with his walker.
59ef45d37f3d71000171e3a7,23,i rushed home after work
59ef45d37f3d71000171e3a7,24,and was amazed to see my father standing in the middle of the room.
59ef45d37f3d71000171e3a7,25,That was the turning point in his recovery
59ef45d37f3d71000171e3a7,26,and his mobility got better and better.
59ef45d37f3d71000171e3a7,27,That was 7 years ago
59ef45d37f3d71000171e3a7,28,and he is back to normal now.
5c2d2348efea570001b9e962,1,Let me share a story from when I was 21 years old.
5c2d2348efea570001b9e962,2,I was living in a small apartment near the city centre.
5c2d2348efea570001b9e962,3,I had just started my first job.
5c2d2348efea570001b9e962,4,I was working as a graphic designer.
5c2d2348efea570001b9e962,5,My father was recovering from surgery.
5c2d2348efea570001b9e962,6,He hadn't been out for about 8 months.
5c2d2348efea570001b9e962,7,He had to use a wheelchair to get about.
5c2d2348efea570001b9e962,8,The only person to help him was a kind lady neighbour in her 60s.
5c2d2348efea570001b9e962,9,My sister was at college.
5c2d2348efea570001b9e962,10,So it was just my Dad and this neighbour.
5c2d2348efea570001b9e962,11,One day I got this strange feeling saying if I go to the park at lunchtime and pray for my father's recovery he will improve.
5c2d2348efea570001b9e962,12,There was no one around.
5c2d2348efea570001b9e962,13,So I went to the park and found a quiet spot.
5c2d2348efea570001b9e962,14,I got the feeling again.
5c2d2348efea570001b9e962,15,I thought there is no harm in trying.
5c2d2348efea570001b9e962,16,So I found a bench under a large oak tree and prayed.
5c2d2348efea570001b9e962,17,I looked up at the big branches.
5c2d2348efea570001b9e962,18,I thought well I'm not perfect but there's no harm in trying.
5c2d2348efea570001b9e962,19,I closed my eyes.
5c2d2348efea570001b9e962,20,"I said ""God I don't know if you are listening but if you are please can you help my father gain his independence once more and enjoy his life."""
5c2d2348efea570001b9e962,21,I opened my eyes and went back to work.
5c2d2348efea570001b9e962,22,Suddenly I received a text from my father saying he had managed a few steps with his walker.
5c2d2348efea570001b9e962,23,I couldn't believe that my prayer had been answered.
5c2d2348efea570001b9e962,24,I rushed round after work.
5c2d2348efea570001b9e962,25,I found my father standing with the aid of his walker.
5c2d2348efea570001b9e962,26,He hadn't been able to do that for months without help.
5c2d2348efea570001b9e962,27,Here he was taking small steps.
5c2d2348efea570001b9e962,28,He continued to improve.
5c2d2348efea570001b9e962,29,He had most of his mobility after a year.
5c2d2348efea570001b9e962,30,Seven years later he was almost fully recovered.
5c2d2348efea570001b9e962,31,He was walking about without any help.
5c2d2348efea570001b9e962,32,He was enjoying his seventies.
60b7d851f18e424aa48f30a0,1,The story is about a young lady
60b7d851f18e424aa48f30a0,2,"who was working far from home,"
60b7d851f18e424aa48f30a0,3,she had to leave her ailing father
60b7d851f18e424aa48f30a0,4,who was not able to do anything for himself
60b7d851f18e424aa48f30a0,5,"nor walk for about eight months,"
60b7d851f18e424aa48f30a0,6,since nobody in the family could help out during the day
60b7d851f18e424aa48f30a0,7,"their neighbour who is a lady was the one who helped her dad,"
60b7d851f18e424aa48f30a0,8,she says that one day while in her office
60b7d851f18e424aa48f30a0,9,she had a urge that she should pray
60b7d851f18e424aa48f30a0,10,"maybe some miracle would happen,"
60b7d851f18e424aa48f30a0,11,she then went to the park
60b7d851f18e424aa48f30a0,12,which was not too far from her office
60b7d851f18e424aa48f30a0,13,and sat on a bench
60b7d851f18e424aa48f30a0,14,that feeling came back again
60b7d851f18e424aa48f30a0,15,and with faith she started praying silently
60b7d851f18e424aa48f30a0,16,then went back to work
60b7d851f18e424aa48f30a0,17,which was when she received a call from her dad
60b7d851f18e424aa48f30a0,18,that he had taken his first step with his walker
60b7d851f18e424aa48f30a0,19,she was so happy
60b7d851f18e424aa48f30a0,20,that she went back home
60b7d851f18e424aa48f30a0,21,when she got there her dad was standing in the kitchen
60b7d851f18e424aa48f30a0,22,"and that was when she believed that maybe her prayers,"
60b7d851f18e424aa48f30a0,23,it's been 7 years since that incident
60b7d851f18e424aa48f30a0,24,and her dad is walking on his own.

608b445691f3225d81ca0f02,5,who is using a wheel chair

608b445691f3225d81ca0f02,9,she looked around
608b445691f3225d81ca0f02,10,and there was no one.
608b445691f3225d81ca0f02,11,She decided to go to the park
608b445691f3225d81ca0f02,12,"which was a few minutes away from her office,"
608b445691f3225d81ca0f02,13,while at the park
608b445691f3225d81ca0f02,14,she heard that voice again encouraging her to pray
608b445691f3225d81ca0f02,15,still there was no one.
608b445691f3225d81ca0f02,16,she found a spot to pray at
608b445691f3225d81ca0f02,17,which was under an oak tree
608b445691f3225d81ca0f02,18,"she sat on the bench and prayed"" God please heal my father"","
608b445691f3225d81ca0f02,19,after she prayed
608b445691f3225d81ca0f02,20,"she got a text from her father telling her, he was able to walk."
608b445691f3225d81ca0f02,21,After work she rushed home
608b445691f3225d81ca0f02,22,only to find her father standing up with that walker.
608b445691f3225d81ca0f02,23,It has been six to seven years now
608b445691f3225d81ca0f02,24,and her father is completely healed

5fb2808bf1937b872c6ad534,7,One day when the writer was at work
5fb2808bf1937b872c6ad534,8,he got this feeling or urge to pray for his father's recovery.
5fb2808bf1937b872c6ad534,9,He walked to the park
5fb2808bf1937b872c6ad534,10,which was about 10 minutes from his office
5fb2808bf1937b872c6ad534,11,and looked for a quiet place to sit.
5fb2808bf1937b872c6ad534,12,He sat there
5fb2808bf1937b872c6ad534,13,and started praying
5fb2808bf1937b872c6ad534,14,even though it had been a long time since he had prayed for anything.
5fb2808bf1937b872c6ad534,15,Soon after he received a call from his father

5f2c7dd707d4af164bd0e3aa,3,Somebody that knows the son told the son to pray for the persons recovery.
5f2c7dd707d4af164bd0e3aa,4,The son didn't really know how to pray.
5f2c7dd707d4af164bd0e3aa,5,He therefore went to a park bench and sat on it.
5f2c7dd707d4af164bd0e3aa,6,He prayed.
5f2c7dd707d4af164bd0e3aa,7,Then all of a sudden the father phoned to tell the son how he'd taken 3 steps.

5b082f3d61cde20001b6706e,12,And found a quiet spot 10 mins walk away underneath an oak tree.

5b082f3d61cde20001b6706e,14,And prayed for father to regain his independence.

6053481988ab695c25edb4d9,8,"One day I got this feeling while I was at work,"
6053481988ab695c25edb4d9,9,"telling me ""Go to the nearby park and pray for your father's recovery, he will start to improve""."
6053481988ab695c25edb4d9,10,I went to the park during my break.
6053481988ab695c25edb4d9,11,I sat under a big oak tree.
6053481988ab695c25edb4d9,12,I said to myself prayers can make a difference
6053481988ab695c25edb4d9,13,and it doesn't hurt to try.
6053481988ab695c25edb4d9,14,I said a little prayer
6053481988ab695c25edb4d9,15,and went back to work.
6053481988ab695c25edb4d9,16,"I got a text message from my father saying: ""I took a few steps with my walker""."
6053481988ab695c25edb4d9,17,I couldn't believe it.
6053481988ab695c25edb4d9,18,It felt like a sign that my prayer had been heard.

5aea85695822e100014aba09,1,Let me tell you a story from when I was twenty-one.
5aea85695822e100014aba09,2,I was living in a small apartment in the city.
5aea85695822e100014aba09,3,I worked as a - uh - graphic designer.
5aea85695822e100014aba09,4,My father had a surgery 8 months ago and the only person with him was a care assistant.
5aea85695822e100014aba09,5,One day at work I had the strong urge to pray for my fathers health at the local park on my break.
5aea85695822e100014aba09,6,I looked around and didnt see anyone so decided to go to the park.
5aea85695822e100014aba09,7,"Once there, I looked around and again saw nobody."
5aea85695822e100014aba09,8,"I started to pray ""Please let my father recover and be able to walk again"" I said."
5aea85695822e100014aba09,9,A few minutes later my dad called telling me he had been able to take some steps with his walker.
5aea85695822e100014aba09,10,"I went to visit him that evening and there he was able to stand and take some steps, he hadn't been able to do that in months without assistance."
5aea85695822e100014aba09,11,Over the next few years my father's health improved and now eight years later he is able to walk again and be active even though he's in his seventies.
5aea85695822e100014aba09,12,This was the turning point of my father's health.
60041b89f0b70121fb013c80,1,I was 21 years old

60041b89f0b70121fb013c80,4,My father gets sick
60041b89f0b70121fb013c80,5,and has a problem with his leg.
60041b89f0b70121fb013c80,6,He cannot stand up
60041b89f0b70121fb013c80,7,and is in the hospital.
60041b89f0b70121fb013c80,8,A neighbor in her 60s is the only one going there to visit him.
60041b89f0b70121fb013c80,9,I do have a sister
60041b89f0b70121fb013c80,10,but she isn't nearby.
60041b89f0b70121fb013c80,11,I am at work
60041b89f0b70121fb013c80,12,and hear a voice say that I should pray for my dad
60041b89f0b70121fb013c80,13,that he would get better.
60041b89f0b70121fb013c80,14,I look around
60041b89f0b70121fb013c80,15,but there is no one there.
60041b89f0b70121fb013c80,16,The voice says that I should go to the park nearby the office
60041b89f0b70121fb013c80,17,and pray for my dad.
60041b89f0b70121fb013c80,18,I got to the park
60041b89f0b70121fb013c80,19,and figure I should give praying for my dad a chance.
60041b89f0b70121fb013c80,20,I was brought up to believe that prayer works.
60041b89f0b70121fb013c80,21,I say to God that if it is at all possible please heal my dad.
60041b89f0b70121fb013c80,22,Later I see my dad standing up next to his walker.
60041b89f0b70121fb013c80,23,I take this as a sign that something has happened.
60041b89f0b70121fb013c80,24,In a few days my dad is walking.
60041b89f0b70121fb013c80,25,He gets better
60041b89f0b70121fb013c80,26,and is now living a normal life.
60041b89f0b70121fb013c80,27,He is in his 70's.

5d593bb9035b8900189e4a42,3,"He saw no one else during the day,"
5d593bb9035b8900189e4a42,4,couldn't walk
5d593bb9035b8900189e4a42,5,and hadn't been out of the house in about 7 months.
5d593bb9035b8900189e4a42,6,"The guy at work had an urge to pray for his dad's recovery,"
5d593bb9035b8900189e4a42,7,"so during his lunch break he went to a local park,"
5d593bb9035b8900189e4a42,8,sat under an oak tree on a bench
5d593bb9035b8900189e4a42,9,"and said a short prayer, that God would help his father recover more quickly from the surgery."
5d593bb9035b8900189e4a42,10,When our praying guy got back to the office he got a text from his father saying that he had taken a few steps with his walker.
5d593bb9035b8900189e4a42,11,When the guy got home his father was standing with the aid of his walker.
5d593bb9035b8900189e4a42,12,Now his father is almost entirely recovered
5d593bb9035b8900189e4a42,13,"and walks unaided,"
5d593bb9035b8900189e4a42,14,and is well in his 70s.
5d593bb9035b8900189e4a42,15,The praying thing happened about 7 years ago.

5e889f1ee6a72c0009e4e69b,4,that I needed to pray for my father to get better.
5e889f1ee6a72c0009e4e69b,5,My father hadn't been very well
5e889f1ee6a72c0009e4e69b,6,and was being cared for at home by his neighbour

5e889f1ee6a72c0009e4e69b,10,so I went to the park.
5e889f1ee6a72c0009e4e69b,11,I found a bench
5e889f1ee6a72c0009e4e69b,12,and sat down under an oak tree.
5e889f1ee6a72c0009e4e69b,13,I closed my eyes
5e889f1ee6a72c0009e4e69b,14,and prayed for my father to recover quickly.
5e889f1ee6a72c0009e4e69b,15,I returned to the office

5e889f1ee6a72c0009e4e69b,20,"When I got home,"
5e889f1ee6a72c0009e4e69b,21,I saw my father standing there with his frame taking more steps.

5e889f1ee6a72c0009e4e69b,23,and my father is now living his life to the full

5fa9392c0cc79c03b3f4eb58,7,I looked around and nobody was around so I went into to the park and under a big oak tree I prayed for my dad.
5fa9392c0cc79c03b3f4eb58,8,I figured it couldn't hurt to try.
5fa9392c0cc79c03b3f4eb58,9,I'd been taught that prayers could help.
5fa9392c0cc79c03b3f4eb58,10,Then my dad texted me and I couldn't believe it- he said he'd taken steps with his walker and he hadn't been able to do that for months.
5fa9392c0cc79c03b3f4eb58,11,That was the turning point and he was able to regain full mobility.

613b77da863afce13714e4c4,5,He was alone during the day
613b77da863afce13714e4c4,6,except for a lady in her 60's who would look after him.
613b77da863afce13714e4c4,7,I had a strong feeling whilst at work
613b77da863afce13714e4c4,8,that I should pray for dad's recovery.
613b77da863afce13714e4c4,9,"In my lunchbreak I went to the local park,"
613b77da863afce13714e4c4,10,"a bit apprehensive,"
613b77da863afce13714e4c4,11,but the park was free of people.
613b77da863afce13714e4c4,12,I sat down on a bench by a big oak tree
613b77da863afce13714e4c4,13,and although I knew how to pray felt quite unsure.
613b77da863afce13714e4c4,14,"I knew that sincere prayer had helped people in the past,"
613b77da863afce13714e4c4,15,"so tentatively, I closed my eyes"
613b77da863afce13714e4c4,16,and said a prayer to ask for recovery for dad
613b77da863afce13714e4c4,17,and for him to be able to regain his independence.
613b77da863afce13714e4c4,18,I went back to work
613b77da863afce13714e4c4,19,and got a message from dad to say he was standing with the aid of his walker for the first time.
613b77da863afce13714e4c4,20,"After work, I rushed home"
613b77da863afce13714e4c4,21,to find dad standing without help.
613b77da863afce13714e4c4,22,He continued to regain the use of his legs
613b77da863afce13714e4c4,23,and could walk.
613b77da863afce13714e4c4,24,He's now fully independent
613b77da863afce13714e4c4,25,and living his fullest life for the past 6 - 7 years.
64835a147dd0f17e8b18b196,1,Age 21 lived with father
64835a147dd0f17e8b18b196,2,"Sister away at college,"
64835a147dd0f17e8b18b196,3,Father in wheelchair
64835a147dd0f17e8b18b196,4,And was looked after by neighbour during the day.
64835a147dd0f17e8b18b196,5,One day at work
64835a147dd0f17e8b18b196,6,Got the overwhelming feeling to pray for fathers health to improve.
64835a147dd0f17e8b18b196,7,Went to park in break
64835a147dd0f17e8b18b196,8,About 10 min walk from work.
64835a147dd0f17e8b18b196,9,Sat on bench under tree
64835a147dd0f17e8b18b196,10,And closed eyes.
64835a147dd0f17e8b18b196,11,Got the urge to pray again
64835a147dd0f17e8b18b196,12,And did so.
64835a147dd0f17e8b18b196,13,When back at work
64835a147dd0f17e8b18b196,14,Father texted to say he had taken 2 steps with walker.
64835a147dd0f17e8b18b196,15,Rushed home at end of working day
64835a147dd0f17e8b18b196,16,To father standing in living room with walker.
64835a147dd0f17e8b18b196,17,Now 7 years later
64835a147dd0f17e8b18b196,18,Father is fully mobile
64835a147dd0f17e8b18b196,19,And in his 70’s.
610816258dd273092f2dc450,1,"A man had recently moved to a new place,"
610816258dd273092f2dc450,2,starting a job as an architect.
610816258dd273092f2dc450,3,"His father is someone who had been in a wheelchair for some time,"
610816258dd273092f2dc450,4,unable to walk at all.
610816258dd273092f2dc450,5,"The man wanted to try and help his father,"
610816258dd273092f2dc450,6,wanting him to be well more than anything.
610816258dd273092f2dc450,7,"He kept getting a message,"
610816258dd273092f2dc450,8,hearing a voice saying to him that he should pray for his father's wellness.
610816258dd273092f2dc450,9,He went out walking and found quiet spots to be.
610816258dd273092f2dc450,10,Three or four times he heard this calling to ask for help in making his dad well.
610816258dd273092f2dc450,11,"Understanding that prayer has been known to help,"
610816258dd273092f2dc450,12,"he did,"
610816258dd273092f2dc450,13,he prayed for his father's wellness.
610816258dd273092f2dc450,14,His father called him at a later point and said that he had managed to walk a few steps with his walker.
610816258dd273092f2dc450,15,The man was so happy that this seemed to be the confirmation that his prayer had been answered.
610816258dd273092f2dc450,16,"In time his father was able to walk more and more,"
610816258dd273092f2dc450,17,and in the span of 7 years he was all the way better and healthy again.
5ef367aa3b28ea0a3aad67ba,1,This morning I left for work in an office.
5ef367aa3b28ea0a3aad67ba,2,My dad has not been well for 6 or 7 year now and uses a wheelchair.
5ef367aa3b28ea0a3aad67ba,3,He was at home and a 60 year old neighbour was with him.
5ef367aa3b28ea0a3aad67ba,4,I suddenly got a strange feeling at work that I should pray to help my dad's recovery.
5ef367aa3b28ea0a3aad67ba,5,I looked around the office and there was no one there.
5ef367aa3b28ea0a3aad67ba,6,I got the feeling that if I went into a nearby park during my break and prayed it might help.
5ef367aa3b28ea0a3aad67ba,7,I took a break and went to the local park.
5ef367aa3b28ea0a3aad67ba,8,I sat on a bench and looked up into the branches of a tree.
5ef367aa3b28ea0a3aad67ba,9,I looked around and there was no one else there.
5ef367aa3b28ea0a3aad67ba,10,I had been told that if you pray it can help make thing better.
5ef367aa3b28ea0a3aad67ba,11,"I was not sure if this was the case, but decided to try."
5ef367aa3b28ea0a3aad67ba,12,"I took another look around, still no one there."
5ef367aa3b28ea0a3aad67ba,13,"I closed my eyes and said ""God if you can hear me, please make my dad better""."
5ef367aa3b28ea0a3aad67ba,14,I returned to the office.
5ef367aa3b28ea0a3aad67ba,15,That afternoon I received a text from my dad.
5ef367aa3b28ea0a3aad67ba,16,"It said, ""I am feeling better and have just stood up""."
5ef367aa3b28ea0a3aad67ba,17,I could hardly believe it.
5ef367aa3b28ea0a3aad67ba,18,"When I got home, my dad was standing there and, with the aid of his walker, took a few steps."
60a6bc4f4cb533e7e0867aab,1,I lived in a small department near the city
60a6bc4f4cb533e7e0867aab,2,"when I got my first job,"
60a6bc4f4cb533e7e0867aab,3,"my father had been unable to move without assistance for about 8 months,"
60a6bc4f4cb533e7e0867aab,4,he got assistance from a nice lady neighbor in her sixties.
60a6bc4f4cb533e7e0867aab,5,One day I got a feeling
60a6bc4f4cb533e7e0867aab,6,"if I prayed for my father at park which was 10 minutes from my office,"
60a6bc4f4cb533e7e0867aab,7,he would be better
60a6bc4f4cb533e7e0867aab,8,so I looked around the office
60a6bc4f4cb533e7e0867aab,9,and saw no one around
60a6bc4f4cb533e7e0867aab,10,so I went to the park
60a6bc4f4cb533e7e0867aab,11,and got that feeling again
60a6bc4f4cb533e7e0867aab,12,so I looked around
60a6bc4f4cb533e7e0867aab,13,and found a bench
60a6bc4f4cb533e7e0867aab,14,and set and closed my eyes
60a6bc4f4cb533e7e0867aab,15,and prayed under an oak tree
60a6bc4f4cb533e7e0867aab,16,that my father got better.
60a6bc4f4cb533e7e0867aab,17,When I came back to the office
60a6bc4f4cb533e7e0867aab,18,I received a call from my father
60a6bc4f4cb533e7e0867aab,19,saying he just took a few steps without any assistance
60a6bc4f4cb533e7e0867aab,20,and he hadn't been able to do that
60a6bc4f4cb533e7e0867aab,21,so I took it as a sign
60a6bc4f4cb533e7e0867aab,22,that my prayer was heard.
606e36e2002550b48214893e,1,My father got ill
606e36e2002550b48214893e,2,and needed surgery
606e36e2002550b48214893e,3,he couldn’t walk.
606e36e2002550b48214893e,4,Something told me to pray for him
606e36e2002550b48214893e,5,I was at work
606e36e2002550b48214893e,6,but left the office
606e36e2002550b48214893e,7,and walked 10 mins to pray.
606e36e2002550b48214893e,8,"Then I got a txt from him,"
606e36e2002550b48214893e,9,"he had managed to walk with his walker,"
606e36e2002550b48214893e,10,within the next year he was back walking
606e36e2002550b48214893e,11,and living his life to his fullest
606e36e2002550b48214893e,12,at age 70.
5d46e0febeeecd0001d01e79,1,Age 21 living in an apartment

5d46e0febeeecd0001d01e79,3,Farther was recovering from surgery
5d46e0febeeecd0001d01e79,4,and a female neighbour was caring for him during the day.
5d46e0febeeecd0001d01e79,5,He was using a wheelchair to get around.
5d46e0febeeecd0001d01e79,6,The person got a strong urge to go to a local park
5d46e0febeeecd0001d01e79,7,"and prey for his recovery,"
5d46e0febeeecd0001d01e79,8,"despite not being a religious person,"
5d46e0febeeecd0001d01e79,9,"they walked to the park,"
5d46e0febeeecd0001d01e79,10,"sat beneath an oak tree,"
5d46e0febeeecd0001d01e79,11,looked up at the branches
5d46e0febeeecd0001d01e79,12,and said a prayer for their farther.
5d46e0febeeecd0001d01e79,13,On the way back to the office
5d46e0febeeecd0001d01e79,14,they received a text message from their farther
5d46e0febeeecd0001d01e79,15,telling them that they had taken some steps using their walker.
5d46e0febeeecd0001d01e79,16,"On returning home,"
5d46e0febeeecd0001d01e79,17,their farther stood to greet them.
5d46e0febeeecd0001d01e79,18,Their farther continued to improve
5d46e0febeeecd0001d01e79,19,and regained full mobility after 1 year.
5d46e0febeeecd0001d01e79,20,This took place 6-7 years ago
5d46e0febeeecd0001d01e79,21,and their farther is now in his 70s
5d46e0febeeecd0001d01e79,22,and doing well.
5c105e2757fd11000127e60f,1,Let me tell you a story about when I was 21.
5c105e2757fd11000127e60f,2,I lived in the city center
5c105e2757fd11000127e60f,3,and worked a job as a graphic designer.
5c105e2757fd11000127e60f,4,I lived with my dad
5c105e2757fd11000127e60f,5,and my younger sister.
5c105e2757fd11000127e60f,6,There was also an old lady in her 60s that lived nearby.
5c105e2757fd11000127e60f,7,One day while at work i had a feeling
5c105e2757fd11000127e60f,8,that i should go pray in the nearby park
5c105e2757fd11000127e60f,9,and my dad would recover.
5c105e2757fd11000127e60f,10,When i went to go pray
5c105e2757fd11000127e60f,11,"i kept having this reoccurring feeling,"
5c105e2757fd11000127e60f,12,and as I tried it despite being skeptical
5c105e2757fd11000127e60f,13,i kept having that feeling.
5c105e2757fd11000127e60f,14,As soon as i finished praying
5c105e2757fd11000127e60f,15,a got a message from my dad
5c105e2757fd11000127e60f,16,saying that he was able to take a few steps.
5c105e2757fd11000127e60f,17,"this was surprising,"
5c105e2757fd11000127e60f,18,when i got home
5c105e2757fd11000127e60f,19,i saw him standing with his walker.
5c105e2757fd11000127e60f,20,"now 6 years later,"
5c105e2757fd11000127e60f,21,he is able to walk again unassisted
5c105e2757fd11000127e60f,22,and is living life to the fullest.
60ae4da634a208d74ae7776b,1,I will share a story
60ae4da634a208d74ae7776b,2,when I was 21 years old.
60ae4da634a208d74ae7776b,3,I lived in a small apartment
60ae4da634a208d74ae7776b,4,close to the city.
60ae4da634a208d74ae7776b,5,I had just started a new job
60ae4da634a208d74ae7776b,6,as a graphic designer.
60ae4da634a208d74ae7776b,7,My father was recovering from surgery
60ae4da634a208d74ae7776b,8,had not been out of the house for a few months
60ae4da634a208d74ae7776b,9,as he was in a wheelchair.
60ae4da634a208d74ae7776b,10,There was a kind neighbor with him at home
60ae4da634a208d74ae7776b,11,whos in her 60s.
60ae4da634a208d74ae7776b,12,My young sister was away at college
60ae4da634a208d74ae7776b,13,so it was just my dad and the neighbor at home during the day.
60ae4da634a208d74ae7776b,14,One day I got this feeling
60ae4da634a208d74ae7776b,15,whilst I was at work
60ae4da634a208d74ae7776b,16,that I needed to go to the near by park in my lunch break
60ae4da634a208d74ae7776b,17,and pray for my fathers recovery.
60ae4da634a208d74ae7776b,18,I went to the park in my lunch break
60ae4da634a208d74ae7776b,19,and there was nobody around me
60ae4da634a208d74ae7776b,20,so I closed my eyes and prayed.
60ae4da634a208d74ae7776b,21,I told myself that it doesnt hurt to try and pray.
60ae4da634a208d74ae7776b,22,I prayed and asked God to help my father recover and enjoy life.
60ae4da634a208d74ae7776b,23,I went back to work
60ae4da634a208d74ae7776b,24,and received a text message from my father saying that he took a few steps.
60ae4da634a208d74ae7776b,25,I could not believe it.
60ae4da634a208d74ae7776b,26,I rushed home after work
60ae4da634a208d74ae7776b,27,and saw my father standing in the living room with his walker.
60ae4da634a208d74ae7776b,28,He took small steps
60ae4da634a208d74ae7776b,29,and continued to recover from there.
60ae4da634a208d74ae7776b,30,Its been 6 or 7 years
60ae4da634a208d74ae7776b,31,and my dad can now walk without any assistance.
60ae4da634a208d74ae7776b,32,His 70 and living life to his fullest.
60a520c051c98eb480c2811f,1,The story is about a person
60a520c051c98eb480c2811f,2,"who had just moved into an apartment,"
60a520c051c98eb480c2811f,3,was 21 years old
60a520c051c98eb480c2811f,4,and working as a graphic designer.
60a520c051c98eb480c2811f,5,The person`s father was just recovering from a surgery
60a520c051c98eb480c2811f,6,and was not able to walk on their own.
60a520c051c98eb480c2811f,7,There was nobody at home to take care of him
60a520c051c98eb480c2811f,8,except an elderly lady neighbour in her sixties.
60a520c051c98eb480c2811f,9,The sister was away in college.
60a520c051c98eb480c2811f,10,One day while the person was at work
60a520c051c98eb480c2811f,11,they felt a voice telling them to go to a nearby park
60a520c051c98eb480c2811f,12,and pray for the father
60a520c051c98eb480c2811f,13,and he would surely recover.
60a520c051c98eb480c2811f,14,The feeling came again
60a520c051c98eb480c2811f,15,and during lunch
60a520c051c98eb480c2811f,16,and they left the office to go to the park.
60a520c051c98eb480c2811f,17,They saw a bench
60a520c051c98eb480c2811f,18,"and again the voice came back,"
60a520c051c98eb480c2811f,19,they began deliberating in their mind
60a520c051c98eb480c2811f,20,on how they had heard such stories
60a520c051c98eb480c2811f,21,and how there was no loss in trying.
60a520c051c98eb480c2811f,22,They were ten minutes walk from their office.
60a520c051c98eb480c2811f,23,They walked and sat below an oak tree
60a520c051c98eb480c2811f,24,and looked up
60a520c051c98eb480c2811f,25,and prayed for the father's recovery.
60a520c051c98eb480c2811f,26,The person walked back to the office
60a520c051c98eb480c2811f,27,and immediately the father called
60a520c051c98eb480c2811f,28,and told them they had taken a few steps with their walker–he was unable to do so before.
60a520c051c98eb480c2811f,29,The person was happy that indeed God had answered their prayer.
60a520c051c98eb480c2811f,30,When the person went home
60a520c051c98eb480c2811f,31,they found their father standing in the living room.
60a520c051c98eb480c2811f,32,After some months the father had fully recovered
60a520c051c98eb480c2811f,33,and could walk on his own again.
60a520c051c98eb480c2811f,34,It had been seven years since the story happened.
5beee551bae98700018aa45a,1,"Let me tell you a story,"
5beee551bae98700018aa45a,2,I moved to the city to work as a graphic designer.
5beee551bae98700018aa45a,3,"My father lived there,"
5beee551bae98700018aa45a,4,but he struggles as he cannot walk.
5beee551bae98700018aa45a,5,He has the help of a nice old lady.
5beee551bae98700018aa45a,6,One day I heard a voice that said if you give a prayer under a tree in the park then your father will get well.
5beee551bae98700018aa45a,7,"During my lunch I sat in the park and found myself under an oak tree,"
5beee551bae98700018aa45a,8,I decided to make a prayer as I was always taught that prayer is good.
5beee551bae98700018aa45a,9,I prayed and went back to my work.
5beee551bae98700018aa45a,10,I received a call later and it was my father saying he had just taken a few steps with his walking stick.
5beee551bae98700018aa45a,11,This was 6-7 years ago and he is now walking.
60fea505c8796961a71b67d9,1,It was a story about someone recounting an event from when they were 21.
60fea505c8796961a71b67d9,2,They lived in the city and had an apartment.
60fea505c8796961a71b67d9,3,Their dad hadn't been well and hadn't left the house for eight months.
60fea505c8796961a71b67d9,4,The storyteller worried about their father when they were at work.
60fea505c8796961a71b67d9,5,All he had for company was a kind neighbour.
60fea505c8796961a71b67d9,6,"One day, when at work she got a feeling."
60fea505c8796961a71b67d9,7,The feeling seemed to suggest that if they went to the local park and prayed their father would be healed.
60fea505c8796961a71b67d9,8,She looked around the office and saw no one else was there and walked to the park.
60fea505c8796961a71b67d9,9,The park was about a 10 minute walk away.
60fea505c8796961a71b67d9,10,They looked around again to see if there was anyone watching.
60fea505c8796961a71b67d9,11,They sat under the oak tree and prayed to God.
60fea505c8796961a71b67d9,12,"'God if you are listening, please help my father to recover'."
60fea505c8796961a71b67d9,13,They had always been told that prayers could come true so they saw no harm in trying.
60fea505c8796961a71b67d9,14,"When they returned to work, they got a message from their father which said he had just taken some steps."
60fea505c8796961a71b67d9,15,"The storyteller went to be with him and found him standing up, able to take a few steps with his walker."
60fea505c8796961a71b67d9,16,He improved and now 6 or 7 years later is fully recovered and lives life to the fullest in his seventies.

643f008ccb54c55128c46b41,2,and unable to walk.
643f008ccb54c55128c46b41,3,Then someone told her
643f008ccb54c55128c46b41,4,that if she prayed
643f008ccb54c55128c46b41,5,then her father would heal.
643f008ccb54c55128c46b41,6,"She was skeptical,"
643f008ccb54c55128c46b41,7,but one day during work break
643f008ccb54c55128c46b41,8,she went to the park
643f008ccb54c55128c46b41,9,and try it out.
643f008ccb54c55128c46b41,10,She prayed under a tree in the park
643f008ccb54c55128c46b41,11,and then her father called her
643f008ccb54c55128c46b41,12,and said he made a break through medically.
643f008ccb54c55128c46b41,13,Then he lived a long life

61532673649c83e233f62033,6,Then one day the graphic designer got a feeling that he should pray.
61532673649c83e233f62033,7,So he went to a park 10 minutes from his work.
61532673649c83e233f62033,8,He closed his eyes
61532673649c83e233f62033,9,and prayed to God asking to help his dad recover.
61532673649c83e233f62033,10,"Shortly after, he received a text from his dad saying he just took a few steps for the first time in months."

6034e8e3628ecdf282096ccf,13,I sat and closed my eyes
6034e8e3628ecdf282096ccf,14,speaking to God.

64a5d369158a0321ae5e50e1,14,He then prayed for his father to recovery.
64a5d369158a0321ae5e50e1,15,He went back to work.
64a5d369158a0321ae5e50e1,16,He got a text message from his father.
64a5d369158a0321ae5e50e1,17,His father said he had walked for the first time without assistance.
64a5d369158a0321ae5e50e1,18,This was the turning point in his recovery.
64a5d369158a0321ae5e50e1,19,It has been months since then.
64a5d369158a0321ae5e50e1,20,His father is now living life to the fullest in his 70's.
628a119d0b74d2b456ce5201,1,I was twenty-one.
628a119d0b74d2b456ce5201,2,I was working as a graphic designer.
628a119d0b74d2b456ce5201,3,"My father hadn't been outside in about 8 months, recovering from a surgery."
628a119d0b74d2b456ce5201,4,Only my Father and a Neighbour lady were at home during the day.
628a119d0b74d2b456ce5201,5,My sister was away at college.
628a119d0b74d2b456ce5201,6,One day at work I had a feeling to go to the park on much lunch break and pray for my Father.
628a119d0b74d2b456ce5201,7,I looked around but noone was around.
628a119d0b74d2b456ce5201,8,So I went to the park on my lunch break.
628a119d0b74d2b456ce5201,9,I looked around again and noone was there.
628a119d0b74d2b456ce5201,10,The feeling came back.
628a119d0b74d2b456ce5201,11,So I took a chance.
628a119d0b74d2b456ce5201,12,I was sat under a big oak tree.
628a119d0b74d2b456ce5201,13,"I know I'm not perfect, but I want to help my father recover."
628a119d0b74d2b456ce5201,14,I'll admit that to anyone.
628a119d0b74d2b456ce5201,15,"I sad ""God, I don't know if you're listening, but please help my father regain his independance and enjoy life again."""
628a119d0b74d2b456ce5201,16,Then I went back to work.
628a119d0b74d2b456ce5201,17,I got a text from my Father saying he was taking steps with his walker.
628a119d0b74d2b456ce5201,18,I rushed home after work to find him standing in the living room with his walker.
628a119d0b74d2b456ce5201,19,He hadn't been able to do that in months.
628a119d0b74d2b456ce5201,20,"Slowly, he began to improve."
628a119d0b74d2b456ce5201,21,"He now walks without any assistance, it's been maybe seven or eight months since then."
628a119d0b74d2b456ce5201,22,He is in his seventies.
5fed9b2291948ab1c1fb2351,1,He was 21
5fed9b2291948ab1c1fb2351,2,living in a small apartment in London.
5fed9b2291948ab1c1fb2351,3,He had a dream about his father
5fed9b2291948ab1c1fb2351,4,and was sitting underneath a tree.
5fed9b2291948ab1c1fb2351,5,"He prayed to God,"
5fed9b2291948ab1c1fb2351,6,"saying he didn’t know if he could hear him,"
5fed9b2291948ab1c1fb2351,7,but please help his father.
5fed9b2291948ab1c1fb2351,8,He then got a text from his Father
5fed9b2291948ab1c1fb2351,9,to say he was up
5fed9b2291948ab1c1fb2351,10,and using his walker.
5fed9b2291948ab1c1fb2351,11,He rushed home after work
5fed9b2291948ab1c1fb2351,12,to find his Father standing
5fed9b2291948ab1c1fb2351,13,and using the walker.
5fed9b2291948ab1c1fb2351,14,His Father continued to improve
5fed9b2291948ab1c1fb2351,15,and is still better 8 years later.
60dfa262b225a8e45b6d4421,1,"The story was about a person,"

60dfa262b225a8e45b6d4421,3,and lived close to the city center.

60dfa262b225a8e45b6d4421,6,and the neighbor helped in taking care of him.
60dfa262b225a8e45b6d4421,7,One day this person got a feeling at work
60dfa262b225a8e45b6d4421,8,that if they went to a nearby park 10 minutes away from their workplace
60dfa262b225a8e45b6d4421,9,"and prayed,"
60dfa262b225a8e45b6d4421,10,the father would get better.
60dfa262b225a8e45b6d4421,11,"Knowing that there was no risk in praying,"
60dfa262b225a8e45b6d4421,12,they went to the park during their break
60dfa262b225a8e45b6d4421,13,and got the strong feeling again that this would work.
60dfa262b225a8e45b6d4421,14,They sat on a quiet area on a bench
60dfa262b225a8e45b6d4421,15,and prayed to God.
60dfa262b225a8e45b6d4421,16,As soon as they got back from their break
60dfa262b225a8e45b6d4421,17,the father called saying that he was able to walk a few steps with the help of his walker.
60dfa262b225a8e45b6d4421,18,"The person was so happy,"
60dfa262b225a8e45b6d4421,19,"and went home as soon as work finished,"
60dfa262b225a8e45b6d4421,20,"and was greeted by their father standing, supported by the walker."

60d1a0e2551b5660575cdd64,1,"The person was 21 years old,"

60d1a0e2551b5660575cdd64,4,His father was in a wheelchair recovering from surgery
60d1a0e2551b5660575cdd64,5,and had been mainly housebound for 8 months.
60d1a0e2551b5660575cdd64,6,The father was generally alone apart from the neighbour
60d1a0e2551b5660575cdd64,7,as the persons younger sister was away at college.
60d1a0e2551b5660575cdd64,8,One day whilst at work the person had a strange feeling
60d1a0e2551b5660575cdd64,9,telling him to go to a nearby park at lunch

60d1a0e2551b5660575cdd64,11,it was quiet at work
60d1a0e2551b5660575cdd64,12,so he went to the park
60d1a0e2551b5660575cdd64,13,and found a quiet spot under a tree
60d1a0e2551b5660575cdd64,14,and whispered a short prayer for his father.
60d1a0e2551b5660575cdd64,15,Shortly after he received a message
60d1a0e2551b5660575cdd64,16,"saying his father had managed to take a few steps without his walker,"
60d1a0e2551b5660575cdd64,17,when he got home

60120be28d147221feddc4d5,5,only the dad and a lady neighbour were present.
60120be28d147221feddc4d5,6,The dad had not been able to walk in 8 months
60120be28d147221feddc4d5,7,"and one day,"
60120be28d147221feddc4d5,8,the character had a feeling to pray for the dad's recovery
60120be28d147221feddc4d5,9,while he was at work.
60120be28d147221feddc4d5,10,They had heard that prayer had some success
60120be28d147221feddc4d5,11,and knew that it did not hurt to try.
60120be28d147221feddc4d5,12,They walked 10 minutes to a park
60120be28d147221feddc4d5,13,and sat under a tree branch
60120be28d147221feddc4d5,14,and kept having the feeling that they needed to pray.
60120be28d147221feddc4d5,15,They prayed for the dad to regain his independence and walk.
60120be28d147221feddc4d5,16,They got a call after praying
60120be28d147221feddc4d5,17,where the dad said that he walked a few steps.
60120be28d147221feddc4d5,18,"When they got back to the unit,"
60120be28d147221feddc4d5,19,the dad was standing with the help of his walker.
60120be28d147221feddc4d5,20,"Since then,"
60120be28d147221feddc4d5,21,the dad worked on his mobility.
60120be28d147221feddc4d5,22,7 or 8 years had past since the prayer
60120be28d147221feddc4d5,23,"and the dad has full function,"
60120be28d147221feddc4d5,24,even in his 70s.
60c4c5e3253d7f15de0bc71a,1,I live in an apartment with my father
60c4c5e3253d7f15de0bc71a,2,who is suffering from cancer.
60c4c5e3253d7f15de0bc71a,3,He is currently being taken care of by my neighbor

60c4c5e3253d7f15de0bc71a,5,I also have a sister.
60c4c5e3253d7f15de0bc71a,6,My neighbor encouraged me to pray for my father
60c4c5e3253d7f15de0bc71a,7,and that God does miracles.
60c4c5e3253d7f15de0bc71a,8,I was at work when I wanted to pray.
60c4c5e3253d7f15de0bc71a,9,I looked around the office
60c4c5e3253d7f15de0bc71a,10,and saw no one was around
60c4c5e3253d7f15de0bc71a,11,and decided to go out.
60c4c5e3253d7f15de0bc71a,12,When I was out I closed my eyes
60c4c5e3253d7f15de0bc71a,13,and when I opened them no one was around.
60c4c5e3253d7f15de0bc71a,14,I then decided to take a 10 minute walk to
59e721e0ac0af70001b36a13,1,The story I was 21 living in the city with my dad who had major surgery.
59e721e0ac0af70001b36a13,2,My sister was at college.

59e721e0ac0af70001b36a13,4,I got this feeling one day that I should go and pray at the park for my dad.
59e721e0ac0af70001b36a13,5,No one was watching at work.
59e721e0ac0af70001b36a13,6,So I went to the park and sat under the tree.
59e721e0ac0af70001b36a13,7,And prayed for my dad's recovery.
59e721e0ac0af70001b36a13,8,"After I prayed, I got a text saying my dad had taken some steps on his own with a walker."
59e721e0ac0af70001b36a13,9,He is now recovered and can live his life to full in his seventies.

56220229ed6e5a0005c7fac1,11,the father has fully recovered.
5c168ae5c241170001c463a6,1,A short while ago
5c168ae5c241170001c463a6,2,when I was 21
5c168ae5c241170001c463a6,3,when I was living alone for college
5c168ae5c241170001c463a6,4,my dad was ill.
5c168ae5c241170001c463a6,5,I heard a quiet voice tell me
5c168ae5c241170001c463a6,6,that if I went to the park to pray
5c168ae5c241170001c463a6,7,that he would start to recover.
5c168ae5c241170001c463a6,8,I looked around
5c168ae5c241170001c463a6,9,and could not see anyone.
5c168ae5c241170001c463a6,10,One day I went down to the park
5c168ae5c241170001c463a6,11,and found a quiet space.
5c168ae5c241170001c463a6,12,I am not perfect
5c168ae5c241170001c463a6,13,but I tried.
5c168ae5c241170001c463a6,14,My father was able to recover
5c168ae5c241170001c463a6,15,"and he's now able to live life to it's fullest,"

5efa472b30809985f5f47e83,3,"she had a younger sister who was away at college,"
5efa472b30809985f5f47e83,4,she lived with her father
5efa472b30809985f5f47e83,5,who was recovering slowly from an operation
5efa472b30809985f5f47e83,6,"and couldn't walk,"
5efa472b30809985f5f47e83,7,instead using a wheelchair.
5efa472b30809985f5f47e83,8,He was friends with a lady
5efa472b30809985f5f47e83,9,who was a neighbour in her sixties.
5efa472b30809985f5f47e83,10,One day the writer felt an urge to go to pray
5efa472b30809985f5f47e83,11,"whilst she was in work,"
5efa472b30809985f5f47e83,12,so she left
5efa472b30809985f5f47e83,13,and went to a nearby park
5efa472b30809985f5f47e83,14,and prayed under an oak tree.
5efa472b30809985f5f47e83,15,"After returning to work,"
5efa472b30809985f5f47e83,16,her dad called her
5efa472b30809985f5f47e83,17,to say he'd taken a few steps with his walker.
5efa472b30809985f5f47e83,18,He continued to improve
5efa472b30809985f5f47e83,19,"and now 6-7 years later,"
5efa472b30809985f5f47e83,20,in his 70's
5efa472b30809985f5f47e83,21,could walk unaided.
62162ab683fc823e78c025e5,1,"I was twenty-one,"
62162ab683fc823e78c025e5,2,living in an apartment in the city centre.
62162ab683fc823e78c025e5,3,I had just started my first job as a graphic designer.
62162ab683fc823e78c025e5,4,"Then about eight months later,"
62162ab683fc823e78c025e5,5,my father had surgery
62162ab683fc823e78c025e5,6,and was unable to walk
62162ab683fc823e78c025e5,7,and was confined to a wheelchair.
62162ab683fc823e78c025e5,8,He lived alone
62162ab683fc823e78c025e5,9,as my younger sister had gone to college
62162ab683fc823e78c025e5,10,and so my father relied on a helpful neighbour
62162ab683fc823e78c025e5,11,who came to assist him regularly.
62162ab683fc823e78c025e5,12,"After about a year,"
62162ab683fc823e78c025e5,13,I was at work
62162ab683fc823e78c025e5,14,when I had a strange feeling
62162ab683fc823e78c025e5,15,that told me to go to the local park in my lunch hour
62162ab683fc823e78c025e5,16,and pray for my father's recovery.
62162ab683fc823e78c025e5,17,"I looked around the office,"
62162ab683fc823e78c025e5,18,"no-one was taking any notice of me,"
62162ab683fc823e78c025e5,19,and so at lunchtime I decided to go to the park
62162ab683fc823e78c025e5,20,as I'd been told.
62162ab683fc823e78c025e5,21,"Again, I had the same feeling,"
62162ab683fc823e78c025e5,22,that I should pray.
62162ab683fc823e78c025e5,23,I didn't see anyone in the park.
62162ab683fc823e78c025e5,24,"I am not a believer in prayers,"
62162ab683fc823e78c025e5,25,but decided to give it a try.
62162ab683fc823e78c025e5,26,I sat on a bench under an oak tree
62162ab683fc823e78c025e5,27,and closed my eyes.
62162ab683fc823e78c025e5,28,"I said ""Please God, help my father to recover."""
62162ab683fc823e78c025e5,29,Shortly afterwards I received a text from my father
62162ab683fc823e78c025e5,30,who said that he had taken a few steps with his walker.
62162ab683fc823e78c025e5,31,He couldn't believe it.
62162ab683fc823e78c025e5,32,"After work, I rushed round to see my father"
62162ab683fc823e78c025e5,33,"and there he was, standing on the steps with his walker."
62162ab683fc823e78c025e5,34,It was the first time he had been able to take any steps for six or seven years.
62162ab683fc823e78c025e5,35,He gradually improved
62162ab683fc823e78c025e5,36,and now after eight years he is able to walk again
62162ab683fc823e78c025e5,37,and lead a full life.
60febeea70275898e6272837,1,I was 21 years old
60febeea70275898e6272837,2,and living in an apartment near the city's center.
60febeea70275898e6272837,3,My Father was recovering from surgery.
60febeea70275898e6272837,4,My sister and a neighbor lady were the only two supports he had.
60febeea70275898e6272837,5,The lady was in her 60's.
60febeea70275898e6272837,6,"One day while at work,"
60febeea70275898e6272837,7,I had a feeling come over me
60febeea70275898e6272837,8,"that if I went to the park and prayed,"
60febeea70275898e6272837,9,my Father's health would start to improve.
60febeea70275898e6272837,10,I looked around my office
60febeea70275898e6272837,11,"and nobody was there,"
60febeea70275898e6272837,12,so I went to the park
60febeea70275898e6272837,13,and sat near an oak tree.
60febeea70275898e6272837,14,I looked around again
60febeea70275898e6272837,15,nobody was around
60febeea70275898e6272837,16,so I prayed for my father.
60febeea70275898e6272837,17,I left
60febeea70275898e6272837,18,"and immediately afterward,"
60febeea70275898e6272837,19,I received a text from my father
60febeea70275898e6272837,20,telling me he had just taken a few steps without assistance.
60febeea70275898e6272837,21,He hadn't been able to do that in years.
60febeea70275898e6272837,22,It made me feel my prayers had been heard.
60febeea70275898e6272837,23,He continued to improve
60febeea70275898e6272837,24,and he now lives a great life
60febeea70275898e6272837,25,"and has independence,"
60febeea70275898e6272837,26,even into his seventies.
614fcba0d71b7a527a512011,1,When I was 21
614fcba0d71b7a527a512011,2,my father had surgery
614fcba0d71b7a527a512011,3,and had to use a wheelchair.
614fcba0d71b7a527a512011,4,He hadn’t been out in eight months.
614fcba0d71b7a527a512011,5,During the day
614fcba0d71b7a527a512011,6,a nice neighbour lady in her sixties stayed with him.
614fcba0d71b7a527a512011,7,While I was at work
614fcba0d71b7a527a512011,8,I got a strong feeling
614fcba0d71b7a527a512011,9,that if I went to a nearby park
614fcba0d71b7a527a512011,10,and prayed
614fcba0d71b7a527a512011,11,he would improve.
614fcba0d71b7a527a512011,12,I went to the park
614fcba0d71b7a527a512011,13,and got the feeling again.
614fcba0d71b7a527a512011,14,I looked around.
614fcba0d71b7a527a512011,15,I closed my eyes
614fcba0d71b7a527a512011,16,and got the feeling for a third time.
614fcba0d71b7a527a512011,17,I said a quiet prayer.
614fcba0d71b7a527a512011,18,I whispered asking for God’s help
614fcba0d71b7a527a512011,19,to help my father recover.
614fcba0d71b7a527a512011,20,When I got back to work
614fcba0d71b7a527a512011,21,I suddenly got a text from my dad
614fcba0d71b7a527a512011,22,saying he had taken a few steps with his walker.
614fcba0d71b7a527a512011,23,That was a turning point.
614fcba0d71b7a527a512011,24,He improved steadily
614fcba0d71b7a527a512011,25,and within a year
614fcba0d71b7a527a512011,26,got back most of his mobility.
60a8b2592eb0a75a134b89f3,1,I was twenty-one years old
60a8b2592eb0a75a134b89f3,2,and living in an apartment.
60a8b2592eb0a75a134b89f3,3,I was working in an office nearby
60a8b2592eb0a75a134b89f3,4,as a graphic designer.
60a8b2592eb0a75a134b89f3,5,My father was bound to a wheelchair
60a8b2592eb0a75a134b89f3,6,because of an accident
60a8b2592eb0a75a134b89f3,7,"and only had a next door neighbor,"
60a8b2592eb0a75a134b89f3,8,a lady in her sixties
60a8b2592eb0a75a134b89f3,9,to help
60a8b2592eb0a75a134b89f3,10,and keep him company during the day.
60a8b2592eb0a75a134b89f3,11,My younger sister was away for college
60a8b2592eb0a75a134b89f3,12,so there was no one else.
60a8b2592eb0a75a134b89f3,13,"One day at work during lunch,"
60a8b2592eb0a75a134b89f3,14,I had a feeling
60a8b2592eb0a75a134b89f3,15,where someone told me
60a8b2592eb0a75a134b89f3,16,I should go to a nearby park
60a8b2592eb0a75a134b89f3,17,to pray for my father's recovery
60a8b2592eb0a75a134b89f3,18,as it would help him actually recover.
60a8b2592eb0a75a134b89f3,19,No one was around
60a8b2592eb0a75a134b89f3,20,so I had been confused.
613129fdf8f6b04c9a7a2429,1,I was twenty one
613129fdf8f6b04c9a7a2429,2,and had just finished my first job.
613129fdf8f6b04c9a7a2429,3,My father had been ill
613129fdf8f6b04c9a7a2429,4,"and was recovering slowly,"
613129fdf8f6b04c9a7a2429,5,he'd been at home for about eight months
613129fdf8f6b04c9a7a2429,6,"with only a lady neighbour for company,"
613129fdf8f6b04c9a7a2429,7,"she was in her sixties,"
613129fdf8f6b04c9a7a2429,8,my sister was away at college
613129fdf8f6b04c9a7a2429,9,so it was just my father and the lady neighbour during the day.
613129fdf8f6b04c9a7a2429,10,He couldn't walk
613129fdf8f6b04c9a7a2429,11,and relied on a wheelchair.
613129fdf8f6b04c9a7a2429,12,One day at work I had this feeling come over me
613129fdf8f6b04c9a7a2429,13,"that I should pray for his recovery,"
613129fdf8f6b04c9a7a2429,14,"no-one in the office saw my reaction to this feeling,"
613129fdf8f6b04c9a7a2429,15,"and it came over me again,"
613129fdf8f6b04c9a7a2429,16,"I'd always been taught that prayers could change things,"
613129fdf8f6b04c9a7a2429,17,so I left the office during my break
613129fdf8f6b04c9a7a2429,18,and went to a park about ten minutes away
613129fdf8f6b04c9a7a2429,19,"and I had the feeling again,"
613129fdf8f6b04c9a7a2429,20,"so I found a bench which was under an oak tree,"
613129fdf8f6b04c9a7a2429,21,looked around
613129fdf8f6b04c9a7a2429,22,and then looked up into the branches
613129fdf8f6b04c9a7a2429,23,and closed my eyes
613129fdf8f6b04c9a7a2429,24,and prayed to God to help my father in his recovery.
613129fdf8f6b04c9a7a2429,25,When I got back to the office
613129fdf8f6b04c9a7a2429,26,I took a call from my father
613129fdf8f6b04c9a7a2429,27,and he said he'd taken his first steps with his walker
613129fdf8f6b04c9a7a2429,28,which he hadn't been able to do before.
613129fdf8f6b04c9a7a2429,29,I went home
613129fdf8f6b04c9a7a2429,30,"and he was standing using the walker,"
613129fdf8f6b04c9a7a2429,31,he improved from then on
613129fdf8f6b04c9a7a2429,32,and within a year he could walk unaided
613129fdf8f6b04c9a7a2429,33,and and was living a good life.
613129fdf8f6b04c9a7a2429,34,My prayers had been answered.
5e9fd839311b8018f88c99eb,1,"I was living in a small apartment in my twenties,"
5e9fd839311b8018f88c99eb,2,near the city center.
5e9fd839311b8018f88c99eb,3,I was living with my dad who needed assistance to get around
5e9fd839311b8018f88c99eb,4,because he was wheelchair bound due to an illness.
5e9fd839311b8018f88c99eb,5,My sister was away at college.
5e9fd839311b8018f88c99eb,6,I had a kind neighbor who would volunteer to assist my dad with his daily needs.
5e9fd839311b8018f88c99eb,7,"One day while at work,"
5e9fd839311b8018f88c99eb,8,"I had a strong vision that if I went to a nearby park to pray for my dad,"
5e9fd839311b8018f88c99eb,9,"he would be healed,"
5e9fd839311b8018f88c99eb,10,"I did so and sure enough,"
5e9fd839311b8018f88c99eb,11,my dad texted me to say he was able to walk.
5e9fd839311b8018f88c99eb,12,"Unbelievably, when I got home,"
5e9fd839311b8018f88c99eb,13,I found my dad walking with the assistance of his walker.
5e9fd839311b8018f88c99eb,14,It's been about 6 years since that miraculous day.
5bda1da4d6fef5000181aab2,1,There's a 21-year-old boy who lives in a small apartment with his dad.
5bda1da4d6fef5000181aab2,2,He works as a graphic designer.
5bda1da4d6fef5000181aab2,3,His dad had a surgery and he's disabled.
5bda1da4d6fef5000181aab2,4,"During the day when the boy is working, their neighbour takes care of the dad."
5bda1da4d6fef5000181aab2,5,"One day, the boy decided that he's going to go to a park,"
5bda1da4d6fef5000181aab2,6,and offer prayers for his father's recovery.
5bda1da4d6fef5000181aab2,7,"He does exactly that during the lunch break,"
5bda1da4d6fef5000181aab2,8,"and moments later, he receives a text message from his dad that he can take a few steps with the help of his walker."
5bda1da4d6fef5000181aab2,9,"A year later, the father is almost normal now"
5bda1da4d6fef5000181aab2,10,and living his live to its fullest.
5fa507fa0776431b370bc0c7,1,"In my twenties,"
5fa507fa0776431b370bc0c7,2,"I started a job near town,"
5fa507fa0776431b370bc0c7,3,and following my dad's surgery
5fa507fa0776431b370bc0c7,4,he was alone at home with the help of a lady neighbor
5fa507fa0776431b370bc0c7,5,as my little sister was at college.
5fa507fa0776431b370bc0c7,6,"One day while at the office,"
5fa507fa0776431b370bc0c7,7,I got a strong feeling to go to the park
5fa507fa0776431b370bc0c7,8,and pray for my dad.
5fa507fa0776431b370bc0c7,9,"As I wanted to help him get better,"
5fa507fa0776431b370bc0c7,10,"during my break,"
5fa507fa0776431b370bc0c7,11,I took off to the park.
5fa507fa0776431b370bc0c7,12,I got the same strong feeling again
5fa507fa0776431b370bc0c7,13,and found a bench under a tree to sit on.
5fa507fa0776431b370bc0c7,14,I looked around
5fa507fa0776431b370bc0c7,15,"and closed my eyes praying,"
5fa507fa0776431b370bc0c7,16,"please God, help my dad recover so he can have his life back."
5fa507fa0776431b370bc0c7,17,I then went back to the office
5fa507fa0776431b370bc0c7,18,and I received a message from my dad telling me that he started taking small steps.
5fa507fa0776431b370bc0c7,19,I rushed home
5fa507fa0776431b370bc0c7,20,to find my dad standing with the aid of his walking stick.
5fa507fa0776431b370bc0c7,21,It has been more than 10 years
5fa507fa0776431b370bc0c7,22,and he continues to recover
5fa507fa0776431b370bc0c7,23,and makes the most of his life.
60e03b37c87de3cc083b358b,1,"Father got into an accident,"
60e03b37c87de3cc083b358b,2,a woman in her 60s was looking after the person father.
60e03b37c87de3cc083b358b,3,The person was at work
60e03b37c87de3cc083b358b,4,and had a sign that they should pray.
60e03b37c87de3cc083b358b,5,No one was in the office.
60e03b37c87de3cc083b358b,6,The person decided to pray
60e03b37c87de3cc083b358b,7,and the father called
60e03b37c87de3cc083b358b,8,and said that they're able to stand
60e03b37c87de3cc083b358b,9,and walk a few steps.
60e03b37c87de3cc083b358b,10,The person went home
60e03b37c87de3cc083b358b,11,and felt like their prayers had been answered by God.
63861a54c47e7f59fdb5a4c8,1,When the story teller was 21 years old
63861a54c47e7f59fdb5a4c8,2,and had just started his first job as a graphic designer
63861a54c47e7f59fdb5a4c8,3,he lived in an apartment in the city.
63861a54c47e7f59fdb5a4c8,4,His father was recovering from an operation
63861a54c47e7f59fdb5a4c8,5,and had lost his independence and mobility.
63861a54c47e7f59fdb5a4c8,6,"His only company was a neighbour in her sixties,"
63861a54c47e7f59fdb5a4c8,7,who called on him every day.
63861a54c47e7f59fdb5a4c8,8,One day the story teller had a strong feeling
63861a54c47e7f59fdb5a4c8,9,that he should go to the park in his lunch break
63861a54c47e7f59fdb5a4c8,10,and pray for his father.
63861a54c47e7f59fdb5a4c8,11,"He did this,"
63861a54c47e7f59fdb5a4c8,12,even though he felt slightly uncomfortable
63861a54c47e7f59fdb5a4c8,13,and self conscious about doing it.
63861a54c47e7f59fdb5a4c8,14,"He sat under an oak tree,"
63861a54c47e7f59fdb5a4c8,15,closed his eyes
63861a54c47e7f59fdb5a4c8,16,and prayed to God that his father may recover his independence
63861a54c47e7f59fdb5a4c8,17,and start being able to enjoy life again.
63861a54c47e7f59fdb5a4c8,18,"When he got back to the office, later that afternoon,"
63861a54c47e7f59fdb5a4c8,19,he received a text from his father
63861a54c47e7f59fdb5a4c8,20,saying that he had managed to take a few steps without his walker.
63861a54c47e7f59fdb5a4c8,21,"And later, when the story teller returned home,"
63861a54c47e7f59fdb5a4c8,22,"his father was standing waiting for him,"
63861a54c47e7f59fdb5a4c8,23,having been able to walk a few more steps.
63861a54c47e7f59fdb5a4c8,24,From this point onwards his father continued to improve
63861a54c47e7f59fdb5a4c8,25,"and is now, many years later, living a fulfilling life in his seventies."
627a8d6ceefe6bc5afb6ebd9,1,"7-8 years earlier,"
627a8d6ceefe6bc5afb6ebd9,2,when he was 21
627a8d6ceefe6bc5afb6ebd9,3,his father had an operation/surgery
627a8d6ceefe6bc5afb6ebd9,4,which meant he couldn't walk
627a8d6ceefe6bc5afb6ebd9,5,and had to use a wheelchair.
627a8d6ceefe6bc5afb6ebd9,6,His younger sister didn't live close
627a8d6ceefe6bc5afb6ebd9,7,"and he worked in the city,"
627a8d6ceefe6bc5afb6ebd9,8,"so the care of his gather came down to a neighbour - a lady, throughout the day."
627a8d6ceefe6bc5afb6ebd9,9,One day when he was sat at his desk
627a8d6ceefe6bc5afb6ebd9,10,a strange feeling came over him
627a8d6ceefe6bc5afb6ebd9,11,"and said "" if you go to the park (which was ten miles away) and pray, your father will get better""."
627a8d6ceefe6bc5afb6ebd9,12,This happened again
627a8d6ceefe6bc5afb6ebd9,13,so the man went.
627a8d6ceefe6bc5afb6ebd9,14,"Once at the park,"
627a8d6ceefe6bc5afb6ebd9,15,he sat under an oak tree
627a8d6ceefe6bc5afb6ebd9,16,and the feeling came over him again.
627a8d6ceefe6bc5afb6ebd9,17,He acknowledged that he wasn't perfect
627a8d6ceefe6bc5afb6ebd9,18,but decided to pray anyway.
627a8d6ceefe6bc5afb6ebd9,19,When he got back to his desk
627a8d6ceefe6bc5afb6ebd9,20,his phone rang
627a8d6ceefe6bc5afb6ebd9,21,and his father told him that he had just taken a few steps using his walker.
627a8d6ceefe6bc5afb6ebd9,22,"When he got home,"
627a8d6ceefe6bc5afb6ebd9,23,he found his dad stood with the walker.
627a8d6ceefe6bc5afb6ebd9,24,He now lives a full life even in his seventies.
63b6d3746c5d6b520bcf0320,1,"when i was 21,"
63b6d3746c5d6b520bcf0320,2,i moved to the city for my first job.
63b6d3746c5d6b520bcf0320,3,My father had surgery
63b6d3746c5d6b520bcf0320,4,"that left him immobile,"
63b6d3746c5d6b520bcf0320,5,he managed with the help with his neighbour.
63b6d3746c5d6b520bcf0320,6,Once at work
63b6d3746c5d6b520bcf0320,7,I felt I should go pray.
63b6d3746c5d6b520bcf0320,8,I went to the park
63b6d3746c5d6b520bcf0320,9,and prayed for him.
63b6d3746c5d6b520bcf0320,10,I then got a phone call from my dad
63b6d3746c5d6b520bcf0320,11,saying that he had taken some steps with his walker.
63b6d3746c5d6b520bcf0320,12,within a year
63b6d3746c5d6b520bcf0320,13,"he was walking unassisted,"

60bc8694c10f8519a26ec749,2,and her dad recently had surgery.
60bc8694c10f8519a26ec749,3,"During the day while she was working,"
60bc8694c10f8519a26ec749,4,her neighbor would help to look after her dad during the day.
60bc8694c10f8519a26ec749,5,One day at work
60bc8694c10f8519a26ec749,6,she had this strong urge to go to the park
60bc8694c10f8519a26ec749,7,and pray for her dad's healing.
60bc8694c10f8519a26ec749,8,"So she went to the park,"
60bc8694c10f8519a26ec749,9,sat at a bench under an oak tree
60bc8694c10f8519a26ec749,10,and prayed a little prayer asking God to heal her dad.
60bc8694c10f8519a26ec749,11,When she got back to the office
60bc8694c10f8519a26ec749,12,her dad sent her a message saying that he walked a few steps with the walker by himself.
60bc8694c10f8519a26ec749,13,It took him a year to recover fully
60bc8694c10f8519a26ec749,14,"and 6/7 years later he is walking without any assistance,"

60fd36bd3daa2d81249f11b2,1,Let me tell a story.
60fd36bd3daa2d81249f11b2,2,I was twenty one living in a city center apartment.
60fd36bd3daa2d81249f11b2,3,"My dad was sick and unable to be alone,"
60fd36bd3daa2d81249f11b2,4,but my sister had moved away to study
60fd36bd3daa2d81249f11b2,5,so a friendly neighbour came to look after him during the day.
60fd36bd3daa2d81249f11b2,6,Every day was just him and the neighbor.
60fd36bd3daa2d81249f11b2,7,One day at work i got a strange feeling
60fd36bd3daa2d81249f11b2,8,"that if i went to the park on my lunch break and prayed,"
60fd36bd3daa2d81249f11b2,9,that my dad would start to recover.
60fd36bd3daa2d81249f11b2,10,"I looked around to see no one in the office,"
60fd36bd3daa2d81249f11b2,11,"so on my break, i went to the park and found a quiet spot."
60fd36bd3daa2d81249f11b2,12,I felt that feeling again.
60fd36bd3daa2d81249f11b2,13,"I sat down and whispered, ""God, please help my dad make a speedy recovery so he may live a happy life to the fullest."""
60fd36bd3daa2d81249f11b2,14,"As soon as i got back to work, i felt that strange feeling yet again."
60fd36bd3daa2d81249f11b2,15,I then received a text from my dad saying that he took a few steps without his walker.
60fd36bd3daa2d81249f11b2,16,He hadn't been able to do that in years.
60fd36bd3daa2d81249f11b2,17,"After work, i rushed home and saw him taking slow steps"
60fd36bd3daa2d81249f11b2,18,and i couldn't believe it - my prayer worked.
60fd36bd3daa2d81249f11b2,19,"Since then, he's been recovering even better -"
60fd36bd3daa2d81249f11b2,20,"six or seven years down the line now, he's almost fully back to his old self, even in his seventies."

5fe3613dafc8a57da1a66760,7,so it just me and our lovely neighbour taking care of him.
5fe3613dafc8a57da1a66760,8,One day while I was as work

5fe3613dafc8a57da1a66760,11,that he wound by healed.

5fe3613dafc8a57da1a66760,16,"I got to the park and set on a bench,"
5fe3613dafc8a57da1a66760,17,I looked around and there was no one
5fe3613dafc8a57da1a66760,18,I thought that maybe it wouldn't hurt to try.
5fe3613dafc8a57da1a66760,19,I prayed as asked God to heal my dad.
5fe3613dafc8a57da1a66760,20,"On my way back to the office I got a call from my dad,"
5fe3613dafc8a57da1a66760,21,He told me he took a few steps on his own.
5fe3613dafc8a57da1a66760,22,I believed that the prayer was answered.
5fe3613dafc8a57da1a66760,23,When I got home I found my dad standing in the living room.

63f7a673985571acc7eeb29a,1,This is a story from when I was twenty one years old.
63f7a673985571acc7eeb29a,2,I was living in an apartment near the city centre.

63f7a673985571acc7eeb29a,7,My younger sister was away at college.
63f7a673985571acc7eeb29a,8,One day at work I had an overwhelming feeling to pray for my dad's recovery at the nearby park.
63f7a673985571acc7eeb29a,9,I looked around and no one was there.
63f7a673985571acc7eeb29a,10,So I went to the park.
63f7a673985571acc7eeb29a,11,I had the overwhelming feeling again.
63f7a673985571acc7eeb29a,12,So I said a little prayer for my father.
63f7a673985571acc7eeb29a,13,When I got back to my desk I had a text.
63f7a673985571acc7eeb29a,14,The text said my father had taken a few steps with his walker.
63f7a673985571acc7eeb29a,15,He hadn't been able to do that in months.

60612b2762141813740d1074,9,and went to the park.
60612b2762141813740d1074,10,He sat on a bench
60612b2762141813740d1074,11,and prayed for his dad's recovery.
60612b2762141813740d1074,12,"Soon, he got a text from his dad"

6306776595b8bee0efa958a0,6,he hadn’t walked for 8 months.
6306776595b8bee0efa958a0,7,She got a feeling

610fddb9524e959f1965db31,1,I was 22 year old
610fddb9524e959f1965db31,2,and living in an apartment in the city center.
610fddb9524e959f1965db31,3,I had just started my first job as a graphic designer.
610fddb9524e959f1965db31,4,"Whilst I was out at work,"
610fddb9524e959f1965db31,5,"my Dad, who had been recovering from a surgery, was at home."
610fddb9524e959f1965db31,6,He hadn't been out in - uh- 6 or 7 months.
610fddb9524e959f1965db31,7,My sister was away at college
610fddb9524e959f1965db31,8,"and so the only person who was at home was my Dad,"
610fddb9524e959f1965db31,9,"and a kind neighbor, who was in her sixties."
610fddb9524e959f1965db31,10,"One day when I was at work,"
610fddb9524e959f1965db31,11,I had an overwhelming feeling.
610fddb9524e959f1965db31,12,I looked around and there was nobody there.
610fddb9524e959f1965db31,13,"I felt I heard a voice say ""If you pray for your father, he will start to recover""."
610fddb9524e959f1965db31,14,I looked around again and could see nobody.
610fddb9524e959f1965db31,15,"I decided to go for a walk to the park,"
610fddb9524e959f1965db31,16,which was around a ten minute walk from my office.
610fddb9524e959f1965db31,17,I looked around the park and could see nobody.
610fddb9524e959f1965db31,18,I noticed the trees.
610fddb9524e959f1965db31,19,"I felt that feeling again,"
610fddb9524e959f1965db31,20,and decided to get down to pray.
610fddb9524e959f1965db31,21,I prayed for my fathers recovery.
610fddb9524e959f1965db31,22,Suddenly I received a text from Father saying that he had taken a few steps.
610fddb9524e959f1965db31,23,Since then he has been recovering from strength to strength for the past few years.
64847582d222606dc6560f62,1,I was 21 years old
64847582d222606dc6560f62,2,and had a good job in the city.
64847582d222606dc6560f62,3,I lived in a small apartment near the city centre.
64847582d222606dc6560f62,4,My father is in a wheelchair
64847582d222606dc6560f62,5,and has limited mobility
64847582d222606dc6560f62,6,and a neighbor who is in her 60s assists my father when she is available.
64847582d222606dc6560f62,7,I decided one day to go to the park
64847582d222606dc6560f62,8,and find a quiet area.
64847582d222606dc6560f62,9,I really don't know if my prayers were going to be answered.
64847582d222606dc6560f62,10,I found a quiet spot
64847582d222606dc6560f62,11,and said a prayer to God to please be able to help my father walk again.
64847582d222606dc6560f62,12,I said my prayer to God
64847582d222606dc6560f62,13,and hoped for a miracle.
64847582d222606dc6560f62,14,After my prayer I left the park
64847582d222606dc6560f62,15,and went back to work.
64847582d222606dc6560f62,16,My father texted me a little while later
64847582d222606dc6560f62,17,and stated he was able to take a few steps with his walker today.
64847582d222606dc6560f62,18,Here it is 6 or 7 years later
64847582d222606dc6560f62,19,and my father is well into his 70s
64847582d222606dc6560f62,20,and is able to walk with the assistance of a walker.
5a94779df05361000171b4fe,1,When I was 21 and working as a graphic designer
5a94779df05361000171b4fe,2,my father was recovering from surgery.
5a94779df05361000171b4fe,3,A neighbor looked out for him.
5a94779df05361000171b4fe,4,One day at work
5a94779df05361000171b4fe,5,"I got this feeling that I should go to a park,"
5a94779df05361000171b4fe,6,a quiet place
5a94779df05361000171b4fe,7,and pray for my father's recovery.
5a94779df05361000171b4fe,8,I had heard that prayer held
5a94779df05361000171b4fe,9,and so I did this.
