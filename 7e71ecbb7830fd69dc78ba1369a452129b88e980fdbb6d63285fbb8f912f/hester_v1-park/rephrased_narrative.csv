1,Let me share a story from when I was twenty-one years old.,Allow me to recount a tale from my twenty-first year.
2,I was living in a small apartment near the city center.,"At that time, I resided in a compact flat close to the downtown area."
3,I had just started my first job.,I had recently embarked on my inaugural employment.
4,And uh I was working as a graphic designer.,"And, well, my role was that of a graphic artist."
5,"My father, who was recovering from a surgery, hadn't been out in – in uh – well I'd say about eight months.","My dad, recuperating from an operation, hadn't ventured outside for – well – roughly eight months."

8,My younger sister was away at college –,"My sister, younger than me, was attending university –"

10,"One day, I got this strong feeling while I was at work.","One particular day at my job, I experienced a powerful intuition."
11,"It told me: ""If you go to the nearby park during your lunch break and pray for your father's recovery, he'll start to improve.""","It seemed to urge me: ""Visit the local park on your lunch break and pray for your dad's health, and he will begin to get better."""
12,I looked around my office.,I glanced around my workspace.
13,I didn't see anyone nearby.,No one appeared to be in my vicinity.
14,"So, I went to the park during my break","Thus, I headed to the park during my recess"
15,and found a quiet spot there.,and located a serene area there.
16,That feeling came back again.,The intuition resurfaced.
17,I looked around once more.,I surveyed the surroundings once again.
18,I still didn't see anyone nearby,"Still, no one was in sight"
19,but I decided to take a chance.,yet I opted to seize the opportunity.
20,"I wasn't too far from my office, maybe a ten-minute walk.","The park was not far from my workplace, just a brief ten-minute stroll."
21,I found a bench to sit on and closed my eyes – uh – uh –,"I chose a bench, sat down, and shut my eyes – uh – uh –"
22,that feeling came back once more.,the intuition returned once again.
23,I just took a deep breath.,I inhaled deeply.
24,I was sitting under a big oak tree now.,"Now, I was seated beneath a grand oak."
25,I looked up at the branches above me.,I raised my eyes to the limbs overhead.
26,Nobody was around.,There was no one present.
27,"And uh I said to myself, well now,","And I thought to myself, well now,"
28,I had been taught that prayers can make a difference.,I had learned that prayers could bring about change.
29,And that it doesn't hurt to try.,And that attempting it bore no harm.
30,"I knew I wasn't perfect, but I wanted to help my dad.","I desired to aid my father, despite not being flawless."
31,I'd admit that to anyone.,I would confess that to anybody.
32,But I was willing to give it a try.,But I was prepared to make an effort.
33,I looked around one more time,I cast a final glance around
34,and then I closed my eyes,and then I shut my eyes once more
35,and said a quiet prayer.,and offered a silent prayer.
36,"I whispered, ""God, I don't know if you're listening.","I murmured, ""God, I'm unsure if You hear me."
37,But I ask you to please help my father recover.,Yet I implore You to aid in my father's healing.
38,"So he can regain his independence and enjoy life again.""","So that he may reclaim his autonomy and relish life anew."""
39,I opened my eyes,I opened my eyes again

42,"It said, ""I just took a few steps with my walker.""","He wrote, ""I've managed to walk a few steps with my walker."""
43,I – I couldn't believe it.,I was astounded.
44,It felt like a sign that my prayer had been heard.,It seemed to be a signal that my prayer was acknowledged.
45,I rushed home after work,I hurried to my home after finishing work
46,and saw my father standing in the living room with the help of his walker.,"and witnessed my dad upright in the living room, supported by his walker."
47,He hadn't been able to do that in months without assistance.,He had not managed that for months without help.
48,"And there he was, taking small steps.","Yet there he was, inching forward."
49,That was the turning point in his recovery.,That moment marked a pivotal change in his recuperation.

51,and regained most of his mobility within a year.,and reclaimed much of his movement within the span of a year.
52,"It's been, what, six or seven years since then?","It's been, what, six or seven years now?"
