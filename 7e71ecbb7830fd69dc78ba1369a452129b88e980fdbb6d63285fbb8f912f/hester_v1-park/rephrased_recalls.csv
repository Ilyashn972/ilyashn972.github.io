I reopened my eyes and returned to my job. Out of the blue, I got a message from my dad indicating he had taken a few paces using his walking frame. It was astounding to me that my supplication had received a response. I hurried over post-work. There stood my dad, upright with the support of his walker. He had not managed that in months without assistance. Yet there he was, making tentative strides. He kept on progressing. After a year, he regained much of his movement capability. Seven years on, he had nearly made a full recovery. He was ambulating independently. He was delighting in his seventieth decade.",1835,0.1376594868384251
63ebbd2e45a16584b49227f1,"Story from when I was twenty-one years old. Living in a small apartment near the city center. First job. Graphic designer. My father, recovering from a surgery, hadn't been out in about eight months. Used a wheelchair to get around. Kind neighbor, lady in her sixties. My younger sister at college â€“ just my dad and the neighbor lady at home. One day, strong feeling while I was at work. It told me: ""If you go to the nearby park during your lunch break and pray for your father's recovery, he'll start to improve."" I looked around my office. I didn't see anyone nearby. So, I went to the park during my break and found a quiet spot there. Feeling came back again. I looked around once more. I still didn't see anyone nearby but I decided to take a chance. I wasn't too far from my office, maybe a ten-minute walk. I found a bench to sit on and closed my eyes feeling came back once more. Took a deep breath. A big oak tree now. Nobody was around I said to myself, well now, I had been taught that prayers can make a difference. Wanted to help my dad give it a try. Closed my eyes and said a quiet prayer. I whispered, ""God, I don't know if you're listening. But I ask you to please help my father recover. So he can enjoy life again. Went back to work. Suddenly,received a text message from my father. It said, ""I just took a few steps with my walker."" I couldn't believe it. Sign that my prayer had been heard. Rushed home and saw my father standing in the living room. And there he was, taking small steps. Turning point in his recovery. Continued to improve and regained most of his mobility. Six or seven years since then? My father now able to walk without any assistance. He's living life to the full, even in his seventies.",1731,0.35,"Recollection from my twenty-first year. Resided in a compact flat close to the downtown area. Embarked on my initial career. Employed as a graphic artist. My dad, recuperating from an operation, had been housebound for roughly eight months. Relied on a wheelchair for mobility. Friendly neighbor, a woman in her sixties. With my younger sibling at university â€“ it was just my father and the neighbor woman at the house. Felt a powerful intuition while at my job one day. It seemed to urge me: ""Visit the nearby park on your lunch break and offer a prayer for your dad's health, and he will begin to get better."" I glanced around my workspace. No one appeared to be in the vicinity. Thus, I headed to the park on my break and located a secluded area. The intuition resurfaced. I surveyed the surroundings once again. Still no one in sight, but I opted to take the risk. The park wasn't much of a distance from my workplace, just a brief ten-minute stroll. I chose a bench, sat down, and with my eyes shut, the feeling returned. Inhaled deeply. Beside a grand oak tree now. With no one else present, I thought to myself, indeed, I had learned that prayers could be influential. Desiring to aid my father, I decided to give it a shot. Eyes closed, I murmured a silent supplication. I softly uttered, ""God, I'm not sure if you're paying attention. But I implore you to aid in my father's healing, so he may once again relish life."" Returned to my job post-prayer. Out of the blue, I got a text from my dad. His message read, ""I've managed to take a few steps using my walker."" I was astounded. A sign that my prayer had not gone unnoticed. Hastened back to my residence and witnessed my dad upright in the living room. There he stood, pacing incrementally. It was a pivotal moment in his convalescence. He kept on getting better and reclaimed much of his ability to walk. Has it been six or seven years since that time? My dad is now walking unaided. He's fully embracing life, even into his seventies.",1998,0.1927766074410285
