"At twenty-one, the narrator was living in a small apartment near the city center and had just started a job as a graphic designer. During this time, their father, who had been recovering from surgery and was wheelchair-bound for eight months, was mostly looked after by a kind neighbor, as the narrator's younger sister was away at college. One day at work, the narrator felt a strong urge to go to a nearby park during their lunch break to pray for their father's recovery. Following this intuition, they found a quiet spot under a big oak tree and prayed for their father's health and independence. Shortly after the prayer, the narrator received a text from their father announcing that he had managed to take a few steps using his walker, something he hadn't been able to do for months. This event marked a significant turning point in his recovery. Over the following year, he continued to improve and eventually regained most of his mobility. Several years later, the narrator reflects on this experience, noting that their father is now able to walk without any assistance and is enjoying life fully in his seventies.",1124,151.52348512034004,0.13
