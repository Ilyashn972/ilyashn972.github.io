I got this feeling one day that I should go and pray at the park for my dad. No one was watching at work. So I went to the park and sat under the tree. And prayed for my dad's recovery.

5beee551bae98700018aa45a,"Let me tell you a story, I moved to the city to work as a graphic designer. My father lived there, but he struggles as he cannot walk. He has the help of a nice old lady. One day I heard a voice that said if you give a prayer under a tree in the park then your father will get well. During my lunch I sat in the park and found myself under an oak tree, I decided to make a prayer as I was always taught that prayer is good. I prayed and went back to my work. I received a call later and it was my father saying he had just taken a few steps with his walking stick. This was 6-7 years ago and he is now walking.",610,69.30094145903001,0.11

5fa9392c0cc79c03b3f4eb58,"Let me share a story from when I was 21 years old. I was living in a small apartment in the city centre. I had just started a graphic design job. My father lived nearby and was recovering from a surgery. He lived on his own and a neighbour lady in her sixties helped him. One day I was at work and I had the strong feeling I should go to the park that lunchtime and pray for my father. I looked around and nobody was around so I went into to the park and under a big oak tree I prayed for my dad. I figured it couldn't hurt to try. I'd been taught that prayers could help. Then my dad texted me and I couldn't believe it- he said he'd taken steps with his walker and he hadn't been able to do that for months. That was the turning point and he was able to regain full mobility. That was 6 or 7 years ago and he's living life to the fullest, even in his seventies.",863,137.48685444714,0.16
