In the day time, only the dad and a lady neighbour were present. The dad had not been able to walk in 8 months and one day, the character had a feeling to pray for the dad's recovery while he was at work. They had heard that prayer had some success and knew that it did not hurt to try. They walked 10 minutes to a park and sat under a tree branch and kept having the feeling that they needed to pray. They prayed for the dad to regain his independence and walk. They got a call after praying where the dad said that he walked a few steps. When they got back to the unit, the dad was standing with the help of his walker. Since then, the dad worked on his mobility. 7 or 8 years had past since the prayer and the dad has full function, even in his 70s."

I knew that sincere prayer had helped people in the past, so tentatively, I closed my eyes and said a prayer to ask for recovery for dad and for him to be able to regain his independence. I went back to work and got a message from dad to say he was standing with the aid of his walker for the first time. After work, I rushed home to find dad standing without help.
