Way beyond the old treehouse. One cat got stuck in a treetop. We had a treehouse in that treetop. We used to spend summers in that treehouse. What fun! He was able to climb to the top. He could gently lift cats to safety. I could only climb up half way. Tomboy, that's what Mrs Baker used to call me. Her shrill tone of ""Tomboy"", still rings in my ears today. All these years later. Once, the cat lady, (for that what we called her), rang the police! She thought we were stuck in the tree. ""What you doing up there, tomboy"", she yelled at me. She was on the phone to the police. Arriving as though there was a hostage seige, two police cars swooped down the gravelly rough pathways. The pathways were through the tall lofty trees. The sound of the fire brigade was ringing out behind them. Everyone came out of their cottages. They were peering, and mumbling to each other over the fences. They were pointing at our treehouse. And that's all I can remember. I woke up on Mrs Baker's sofa. Several cats were licking my face. Her grand son was reading his comic. He was crosslegged on the floor directly opposite me. The police, with concerned frowns, were talking. They were pointing towards me. What a day that was! It was the second time!"
