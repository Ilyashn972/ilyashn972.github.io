The late afternoon sun bathes the setting in a warm glow as Mrs. Baker and the young narrator make their way towards the old mill. Following a small path, they arrive at the spot where the boy's baseball cap was discovered, partially hidden among the wild foliage. The cap, faded and dusty, is a poignant reminder of their mission. The mill, a relic from a bygone era, stands silent and imposing, its weathered boards creaking in the gentle breeze. Mrs. Baker, wearing her floral dress, and the narrator, an 8-year-old tomboy, search meticulously, moving through the underbrush and tall grass. They continue the search, tracing possible routes the boy might have taken, their determination unwavering even as the forest grows denser and the light begins to fade. Despite their thorough efforts, no further signs or traces are found. With a shared resolve, they decide to head back, the cap securely in Mrs. Baker's hand, marking the end of the day's search against a backdrop of setting sun and the whispering leaves of the mill's guarded woods.
