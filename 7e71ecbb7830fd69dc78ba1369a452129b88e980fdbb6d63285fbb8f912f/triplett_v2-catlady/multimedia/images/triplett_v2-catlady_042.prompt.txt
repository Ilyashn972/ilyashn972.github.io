The afternoon light gently dapples through the leaves, casting a warm glow over the scene. The boy, firmly settled on a broad branch, immerses himself in the colorful worlds of his comic book, unworried by the earlier confusion. His presence confirms that he had never disappeared, offering a comforting resolution to the day's worries. The day's uncertainty is soothed by the calm assurance of returning to this familiar hideaway, where childhood dreams hold sway over the mundane challenges of the outside world.
