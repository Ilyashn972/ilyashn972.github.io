She had at least 20 cats or had rehomed some, she lived with her grandson. I was a tomboy. The grandson wanted to be my friend but I didn't like him. He was not nice and had poor manners, goodness gracious me he had poor manners. One day he left a note saying he had run away the grandmother came to me to ask to help find him she kept nagging. I said we will look for him and then call the police if needed. We went looking and found his baseball cap at the old mill but no trace of him. We went to the treehouse club and found him reading a comic. Sherriff Dawson said I should stay low for a while as the old lady doesn't forget so I laid low out of sight. That was the second time."

Mrs Baker would always be nagging him about me and one day he ran away. She came to my house and found me in the treehouse, big tabby cat in tow. I said i would look for him with her. We found his baseball cap by the old mill. In the end he was in a trehouse with a comic book in hand. It was a treehouse club. He hadn't run away. The next day the sheriff told me to lay low. The woman never forgets when she gets something into her head. So i laid low. That was the second time."

She lived in a neighborhood that had a lady with 20 cats. There was a boy who came to live with the lady. He quite liked the tomboyish girl and one day disappeared. But they found him reading in a tree house. The lady I assume blamed her for the boy's disappearance. The sheriff then told the girl to lay low for some time because the lady doesn't forget and she holds grudges."

She must have adopted 20 or so cats, and rehomed even more. She was always trying to get me with her grandson, who had really bad manners. He would always act as if he expected me to go with him, but boy his manners were so bad. One day he said he was going to run away from home because I turned him down, and his grandma came to my treehouse with a tabby cat in tow and said I had better go find him. I searched for hours but couldn't find a trace of him other than his baseball cap, so I told Mrs. Baker she had better call the police. As we were on our way back home there he was, in the treehouse with a comic book. He hadn't ran away from home at all. It seemed like everything was fine in the end, but then the local sheriff Officer Blake came over and told me that I had better lay low and stay out of sight because that woman never forgot a thing when she set her mind on something. So that's what I did, I laid low and stayed out of sight. That was the second time."

She had adopted - or found homes for- twenty cats. But Mrs Baker had a nephew called something, who wanted to make friends with me because I was a Tom Boy. I didn't like him because he had really bad manners - terrible manners. One day, Mrs Baker thought that he would run away because she was always nagging him about me. She came to my treehouse, tabby cat in tow, and asked me to help her. We trailed all over town and checked where they found his baseball cap, but he wasn't to be found. Then we came to the treehouse club (unclear if it is the same treehouse or not) and there he was on a branch reading a comic book. I was relieved and was glad- but the Sheriff told me she never forgets a face so I had to lay low for a while so I did. That was for the second time. I am not sure what it means by the second time."

She had adopted at least twenty – or had given them homes. But she had – a young grandson and back then I was quite the tomboy. And apparently, he was trying to befriend me. I never caught on. Truth is I didn't take to him much because he had – He was a charming lad until you saw his manners. He had poor manners. Goodness gracious he had poor manners. Then he left a note one day saying he was going to run away because she was always nagging about me. She came to my treehouse. Big old tabby cat in tow. I talked her down and said “Well we'll go find him and if we can't locate him, you can – go ahead and call the police if you need to.” I was strategizing. So she took my advice. And we went to where they found his baseball cap – near the old mill and we trailed a bit more and we didn't find a trace. And returned – it was a treehouse club – he was sitting on a branch with a comic book in his hand. He hadn't run away. But – however – that resolved it for that day. But that evening the local sheriff, Officer Dawson said “You better lay low and stay out of sight because that woman never forgets anything once she gets it into her mind.” And I did. I laid low and stayed out of sight. That was the second time."
