Her grand son was present. I remember that he had terrible manners. Really, really awful manners. Terrible! But he always helped his gran rescue her cats. The cats were from beyond our hideout. Way beyond the old treehouse. One cat got stuck in a treetop. We had a treehouse in that treetop. We used to spend summers in that treehouse. What fun! He was able to climb to the top. He could gently lift cats to safety. I could only climb up half way. Tomboy, that's what Mrs Baker used to call me. Her shrill tone of ""Tomboy"", still rings in my ears today. All these years later. Once, the cat lady, (for that what we called her), rang the police! She thought we were stuck in the tree. ""What you doing up there, tomboy"", she yelled at me. She was on the phone to the police. Arriving as though there was a hostage seige, two police cars swooped down the gravelly rough pathways. The pathways were through the tall lofty trees. The sound of the fire brigade was ringing out behind them. Everyone came out of their cottages. They were peering, and mumbling to each other over the fences. They were pointing at our treehouse. And that's all I can remember. I woke up on Mrs Baker's sofa. Several cats were licking my face. Her grand son was reading his comic. He was crosslegged on the floor directly opposite me.

Nevertheless, he consistently assisted his grandmother in saving her cats. These cats came from far beyond our secret spot. Well past the ancient tree fort. A cat once became trapped high in a tree. Our tree fort was nestled in that very tree. We would spend our summer days in that fort. Such great times! He managed to scale it all the way to the top. He was adept at retrieving cats and bringing them down safely. I was only able to make it halfway up. Mrs. Baker would call me 'Tomboy' in her unique way. The piercing call of 'Tomboy' from her still echoes in my mind. Even after all these years. There was a time when the cat lady (as we referred to her) called the authorities! She was under the impression that we were stranded in the tree. ""What are you doing up there, tomboy?"" she shouted at me. At that moment, she was on the line with the police. Two patrol cars arrived hastily, as if responding to a major incident, along the stony paths. These paths cut through the towering trees. The sound of the fire department's sirens followed closely behind. All the neighbors emerged from their homes. They were gazing and whispering to one another across their fences.
