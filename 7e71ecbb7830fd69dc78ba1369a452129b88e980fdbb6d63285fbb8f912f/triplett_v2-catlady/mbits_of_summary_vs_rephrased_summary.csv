One day, he left a note indicating his intention to flee home. I conferred with Mrs. Baker from the sanctuary of my treehouse and proposed we initiate a search before involving law enforcement. Our quest led us to the vicinity of the old mill, his baseball cap the only clue, but he was nowhere to be found there. We circled back to the treehouse club, only to discover him perched on a limb, engrossed in a comic book, having never truly absconded. The crisis was averted for the moment.
