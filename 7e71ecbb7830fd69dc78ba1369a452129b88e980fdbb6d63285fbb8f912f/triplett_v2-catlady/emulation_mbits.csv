0,364.55,0.29,"In the neighborhood where I grew up, Mrs. Baker was known for being the ""cat lady,"" having adopted at least twenty cats. She also had a young grandson who was trying to befriend me, although I wasn't aware of his intentions at the time. I wasn't fond of him due to his poor manners, despite being otherwise charming. One day, the grandson left a note saying he was going to run away, complaining that Mrs. Baker was always nagging him about me. Concerned, Mrs. Baker brought one of her cats and came to my treehouse. I managed to calm her down and suggested we search for him. If unsuccessful, I advised her to consider calling the police. Following my advice, we went to the spot where his baseball cap was found near the old mill. Despite searching further, we didn't find any trace of him. Upon returning to the treehouse, we discovered that the grandson hadn't actually run away; he was sitting on a branch reading a comic book. That settled things for the day. However, later that evening, Officer Dawson, the local sheriff, cautioned me to stay out of sight, warning that Mrs. Baker never forgets once she gets an idea in her mind. I heeded his advice and kept a low profile, just to be safe. This was the second such incident involving Mrs. Baker.",33.77,8.49,5.15,16.92,-6.57,15.6,4.38,15.33,11.79,1.5,-1.2,38.79,15.67,7.01,8.12,9.35,18.93,-0.18,7.27,28.58,1.88,8.51,3.12,5.1,16.97,4.76,11.98,63.15,1.94,0.73,0.16,7.55
