She also had a young grandson who attempted to befriend the narrator, a self-described tomboy. However, the narrator did not reciprocate the friendship due to the boy's poor manners. One day, the grandson left a note stating his intention to run away because Mrs. Baker constantly nagged him about his relationship with the narrator. Concerned, Mrs. Baker, accompanied by her grandson's favorite tabby cat, approached the narrator for help. Together, they searched for the boy, starting at the old mill where they found his baseball cap but no further clues.
