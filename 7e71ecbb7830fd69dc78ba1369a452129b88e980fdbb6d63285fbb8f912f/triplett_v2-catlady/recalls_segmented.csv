5f58c945b5424a055aad846b,7,Advised to lie low and avoid cat lady as she didn't forget things.

5f7f239e9b204e05b6c36538,9,cause she is always nagging him.

5f7f239e9b204e05b6c36538,11,and we went on to look for him.

5ea20fd571038c119083a8df,25,She was on the phone to the police.
5ea20fd571038c119083a8df,26,"Arriving as though there was a hostage seige, two police cars swooped down the gravelly rough pathways."
5ea20fd571038c119083a8df,27,The pathways were through the tall lofty trees.
5ea20fd571038c119083a8df,28,The sound of the fire brigade was ringing out behind them.
5ea20fd571038c119083a8df,29,Everyone came out of their cottages.
5ea20fd571038c119083a8df,30,"They were peering, and mumbling to each other over the fences."
5ea20fd571038c119083a8df,31,They were pointing at our treehouse.
5ea20fd571038c119083a8df,32,And that's all I can remember.
5ea20fd571038c119083a8df,33,I woke up on Mrs Baker's sofa.
5ea20fd571038c119083a8df,34,Several cats were licking my face.
5ea20fd571038c119083a8df,35,Her grand son was reading his comic.
5ea20fd571038c119083a8df,36,He was crosslegged on the floor directly opposite me.
5ea20fd571038c119083a8df,37,"The police, with concerned frowns, were talking."
5ea20fd571038c119083a8df,38,They were pointing towards me.
5ea20fd571038c119083a8df,39,What a day that was!

6020f8518d79b27446a0e2b6,7,who seemed to be a cool lad
6020f8518d79b27446a0e2b6,8,but in actual fact he had bad manners.
6020f8518d79b27446a0e2b6,9,He always wanted to play with me
6020f8518d79b27446a0e2b6,10,"because back then I was a tomboy,"
6020f8518d79b27446a0e2b6,11,but didn't want to play with him.
6020f8518d79b27446a0e2b6,12,One day She came to my treehouse
6020f8518d79b27446a0e2b6,13,and said his grandson was missing

6020f8518d79b27446a0e2b6,16,then Sherriff Dawson was involved
6020f8518d79b27446a0e2b6,17,"we find him reading a comic book under the tree,"
6020f8518d79b27446a0e2b6,18,that was the second time.

613e06f990c5f6002d238d17,6,Then he ran away
613e06f990c5f6002d238d17,7,and she came and found me in my treehouse.
613e06f990c5f6002d238d17,8,Big old tabby cat in tow.
613e06f990c5f6002d238d17,9,The policeman said she doesn't forget.
613e06f990c5f6002d238d17,10,"Then we found the boy,"
613e06f990c5f6002d238d17,11,he hadn't run away.

64622d2c6d50562c9b68e0c1,5,"but he wasn't at the mill,"
64622d2c6d50562c9b68e0c1,6,but at the club treehouse.
64622d2c6d50562c9b68e0c1,7,I was then warned by the sheriff to stay away.

5b3f93fc1388aa0001a80aaf,5,who wanted to befriend me
5b3f93fc1388aa0001a80aaf,6,but I hadn't noticed.
5b3f93fc1388aa0001a80aaf,7,He was nice
5b3f93fc1388aa0001a80aaf,8,but he had poor manners.
5b3f93fc1388aa0001a80aaf,9,Goodness gracious he had poor manners.
5b3f93fc1388aa0001a80aaf,10,One day he had left a note saying he was going to run away.

5b3f93fc1388aa0001a80aaf,14,I said I would help
5b3f93fc1388aa0001a80aaf,15,but then she can call the police.
5b3f93fc1388aa0001a80aaf,16,We went to the quarry
5b3f93fc1388aa0001a80aaf,17,and traced his steps
5b3f93fc1388aa0001a80aaf,18,and found his baseball cap
5b3f93fc1388aa0001a80aaf,19,but then we couldn't trace him.
5b3f93fc1388aa0001a80aaf,20,We turned around
5b3f93fc1388aa0001a80aaf,21,and he was sitting in a tree branch reading a comic.
5b3f93fc1388aa0001a80aaf,22,He hadn't run away.
5b3f93fc1388aa0001a80aaf,23,The police officer said I had better be careful
5b3f93fc1388aa0001a80aaf,24,and lay low
5b3f93fc1388aa0001a80aaf,25,because that woman never forgets anything
5b3f93fc1388aa0001a80aaf,26,so I Did lay low.
5b3f93fc1388aa0001a80aaf,27,That was the second time.

600b00d70c3b950f03a25bd1,8,I would not become his friend
600b00d70c3b950f03a25bd1,9,and he left a note saying he would run away.
600b00d70c3b950f03a25bd1,10,She came to my treehouse looking for him
600b00d70c3b950f03a25bd1,11,and asked me to help find him
600b00d70c3b950f03a25bd1,12,before calling the police.
600b00d70c3b950f03a25bd1,13,We looked around in some places
600b00d70c3b950f03a25bd1,14,"but when we got back to the treehouse,"
600b00d70c3b950f03a25bd1,15,he was there reading.
600b00d70c3b950f03a25bd1,16,He had not run away at all.
56815ef3c5767f00121d2088,1,There was a girl
56815ef3c5767f00121d2088,2,who lived next door to a woman
56815ef3c5767f00121d2088,3,who had 20 cats (or so)
56815ef3c5767f00121d2088,4,plus her son.
56815ef3c5767f00121d2088,5,"Her son wanted to befriend the girl,"
56815ef3c5767f00121d2088,6,but the girl didn't realise that.
56815ef3c5767f00121d2088,7,She found him charming
56815ef3c5767f00121d2088,8,but didn't like his manners.
56815ef3c5767f00121d2088,9,So one day the boy wrote a letter to her
56815ef3c5767f00121d2088,10,saying that he is running away.
56815ef3c5767f00121d2088,11,His mother found out
56815ef3c5767f00121d2088,12,and asked the girl about him.
56815ef3c5767f00121d2088,13,Holding a big tabby cat in her hand.
56815ef3c5767f00121d2088,14,The girl suggested that they call the police
56815ef3c5767f00121d2088,15,which the mum did.
56815ef3c5767f00121d2088,16,They also went to look for him themselves.
56815ef3c5767f00121d2088,17,They found a baseball cap near an old mill.
56815ef3c5767f00121d2088,18,but nothing else.
56815ef3c5767f00121d2088,19,So they went back
56815ef3c5767f00121d2088,20,and found him sitting on a tree branch reading a comic book.
56815ef3c5767f00121d2088,21,The Sheriff advised the girl to lay low
56815ef3c5767f00121d2088,22,because the woman had a very good memory.
56815ef3c5767f00121d2088,23,So the girl laid low.
59f39daef4217300016cbed4,1,A lady had a cat
59f39daef4217300016cbed4,2,and she was very fond of them
59f39daef4217300016cbed4,3,and either kept 20 or so
59f39daef4217300016cbed4,4,or tried to re-home them.
59f39daef4217300016cbed4,5,This lady also had a nephew
59f39daef4217300016cbed4,6,"who was fond of another person in the story,"
59f39daef4217300016cbed4,7,but this nephew had terrible manners
59f39daef4217300016cbed4,8,and the other person in the story was not interested in them.

5b0a9b13444cef0001ca2b32,2,she was known as the cat lady
5b0a9b13444cef0001ca2b32,3,as her house was full of cats she bought.. or found.
5b0a9b13444cef0001ca2b32,4,I was always kinda a tomboy
5b0a9b13444cef0001ca2b32,5,and the neighbours son wanted to be friends with me.
5b0a9b13444cef0001ca2b32,6,One day the son went missing
5b0a9b13444cef0001ca2b32,7,"and I had to help the neighbour find him,"

5b0a9b13444cef0001ca2b32,10,and started looking for him.
5b0a9b13444cef0001ca2b32,11,Eventually we found that he was in his treehouse reading a comic book.
5b0a9b13444cef0001ca2b32,12,After this the police man told me to keep on the low down
5b0a9b13444cef0001ca2b32,13,because the neighbour never forgets a face
5b0a9b13444cef0001ca2b32,14,and she was not happy with me.

5ecd0778c927e4000896da6e,6,but I didn’t take to him
5ecd0778c927e4000896da6e,7,and Mrs Baker didn’t really take to me.

5ecd0778c927e4000896da6e,9,with her tabby cat in hand

5ecd0778c927e4000896da6e,13,reading a magazine.
5ecd0778c927e4000896da6e,14,He was at a treehouse club.
5ecd0778c927e4000896da6e,15,"The sheriff, Mr Dawson told me to stay low"
5ecd0778c927e4000896da6e,16,as Mrs Baker never forgets.
6028e8deb16a4524f12629de,1,I will paraphrase the story below:
6028e8deb16a4524f12629de,2,"In the neighbourhood I grew up in,"
6028e8deb16a4524f12629de,3,Mrs Baker was the local cat lady.
6028e8deb16a4524f12629de,4,She had adopted - or found homes for- twenty cats.
6028e8deb16a4524f12629de,5,"But Mrs Baker had a nephew called something,"
6028e8deb16a4524f12629de,6,who wanted to make friends with me because I was a Tom Boy.
6028e8deb16a4524f12629de,7,I didn't like him because he had really bad manners - terrible manners.
6028e8deb16a4524f12629de,8,"One day, Mrs Baker thought that he would run away because she was always nagging him about me."
6028e8deb16a4524f12629de,9,"She came to my treehouse, tabby cat in tow,"
6028e8deb16a4524f12629de,10,and asked me to help her.
6028e8deb16a4524f12629de,11,We trailed all over town
6028e8deb16a4524f12629de,12,"and checked where they found his baseball cap,"
6028e8deb16a4524f12629de,13,but he wasn't to be found.
6028e8deb16a4524f12629de,14,Then we came to the treehouse club (unclear if it is the same treehouse or not)
6028e8deb16a4524f12629de,15,and there he was on a branch reading a comic book.
6028e8deb16a4524f12629de,16,I was relieved and was glad-
6028e8deb16a4524f12629de,17,but the Sheriff told me she never forgets a face
6028e8deb16a4524f12629de,18,so I had to lay low for a while
6028e8deb16a4524f12629de,19,so I did.
6028e8deb16a4524f12629de,20,That was for the second time.
6028e8deb16a4524f12629de,21,I am not sure what it means by the second time.
5f588f227723ca000cc5e08f,1,The story is about a lady
5f588f227723ca000cc5e08f,2,"who has cats,"
5f588f227723ca000cc5e08f,3,"Mrs. Baker,"
5f588f227723ca000cc5e08f,4,and a Tomboy
5f588f227723ca000cc5e08f,5,who has poor manners
5f588f227723ca000cc5e08f,6,who wrote a note
5f588f227723ca000cc5e08f,7,saying he is leaving
5f588f227723ca000cc5e08f,8,and they had to look for him
5f588f227723ca000cc5e08f,9,but he didn't run away
5f588f227723ca000cc5e08f,10,he was in a tree house
5f588f227723ca000cc5e08f,11,with his comic book
5f588f227723ca000cc5e08f,12,after the sheriff said
5f588f227723ca000cc5e08f,13,they should lay low.
5cf096dbb094d700013e4f87,1,"When I was young,"
5cf096dbb094d700013e4f87,2,"in the neighborhood I grew up in,"
5cf096dbb094d700013e4f87,3,there was a woman named Mrs. Baker.
5cf096dbb094d700013e4f87,4,"She was a cat lady,"
5cf096dbb094d700013e4f87,5,"and had at least twenty cats,"
5cf096dbb094d700013e4f87,6,or had found homes for them.
5cf096dbb094d700013e4f87,7,"She had a grandson who liked me,"
5cf096dbb094d700013e4f87,8,but I didn't like him much because he had very poor manners.
5cf096dbb094d700013e4f87,9,One day he wrote me a note that he was going to run away.
5cf096dbb094d700013e4f87,10,"Mrs. Baker said we would look for him,"
5cf096dbb094d700013e4f87,11,and if we didn't find him I told her she should call the police.
5cf096dbb094d700013e4f87,12,"We went to the place where his ball cap was found,"
5cf096dbb094d700013e4f87,13,but we didn't find him even after a bit more trailing.
5cf096dbb094d700013e4f87,14,"We returned to the treehouse,"
5cf096dbb094d700013e4f87,15,and he was sitting on a branch reading a comic book.
5cf096dbb094d700013e4f87,16,The police said that I should lay low for a while because Mrs. Baker could get very upset.
648f41ef21178f0a0b794669,1,"In the neighbourhood that I grew up in,"
648f41ef21178f0a0b794669,2,Mrs Baker was the resident cat-lady.
648f41ef21178f0a0b794669,3,She had adopted at least twenty of them -
648f41ef21178f0a0b794669,4,or at least given a home to.
5cea26087afd86001a34a5db,1,In the neighbourhood where I lived
5cea26087afd86001a34a5db,2,there was a woman called Mrs Baker.
5cea26087afd86001a34a5db,3,She was a cat woman.
5cea26087afd86001a34a5db,4,She had about 20 cats.
5cea26087afd86001a34a5db,5,And a grandson.
5cea26087afd86001a34a5db,6,I was a tomboy
5cea26087afd86001a34a5db,7,but apparently he liked me.
5cea26087afd86001a34a5db,8,I didn't like him
5cea26087afd86001a34a5db,9,because he had terrible manners.
5cea26087afd86001a34a5db,10,Mrs Baker would always be nagging him about me
5cea26087afd86001a34a5db,11,and one day he ran away.
5cea26087afd86001a34a5db,12,She came to my house
5cea26087afd86001a34a5db,13,"and found me in the treehouse,"
5cea26087afd86001a34a5db,14,big tabby cat in tow.
5cea26087afd86001a34a5db,15,I said i would look for him with her.
5cea26087afd86001a34a5db,16,We found his baseball cap by the old mill.
5cea26087afd86001a34a5db,17,In the end he was in a trehouse with a comic book in hand.
5cea26087afd86001a34a5db,18,It was a treehouse club.
5cea26087afd86001a34a5db,19,He hadn't run away.
5cea26087afd86001a34a5db,20,The next day the sheriff told me to lay low.
5cea26087afd86001a34a5db,21,The woman never forgets when she gets something into her head.
5cea26087afd86001a34a5db,22,So i laid low.
5cea26087afd86001a34a5db,23,That was the second time.
60c7928e14e0a43a43369a5b,1,There was an old lady in the neighbourhood
60c7928e14e0a43a43369a5b,2,who was a cat lady
60c7928e14e0a43a43369a5b,3,she had housed about 20 cats.
60c7928e14e0a43a43369a5b,4,She had a grandson
60c7928e14e0a43a43369a5b,5,that wanted to befriend this girl
60c7928e14e0a43a43369a5b,6,that was a bit of a tomboy.
60c7928e14e0a43a43369a5b,7,The girl did not want to befriend the boy
60c7928e14e0a43a43369a5b,8,because she thought he was ill-mannered.
60c7928e14e0a43a43369a5b,9,The boy threatened to run away
60c7928e14e0a43a43369a5b,10,"because she did not want to befriend him,"
60c7928e14e0a43a43369a5b,11,he wrote all of this in a note
60c7928e14e0a43a43369a5b,12,that the lady showed to the girl
60c7928e14e0a43a43369a5b,13,they found him in a tree house
60c7928e14e0a43a43369a5b,14,and the sheriff warned the young girl
60c7928e14e0a43a43369a5b,15,to lay low
60c7928e14e0a43a43369a5b,16,as the cat lady might be holding a grudge against her.
610d1cf3c7b4411f1643e501,1,The story is about a girl
610d1cf3c7b4411f1643e501,2,who lived in a neighborhood
610d1cf3c7b4411f1643e501,3,where there was a elderly lady
610d1cf3c7b4411f1643e501,4,called Mrs.Baker
610d1cf3c7b4411f1643e501,5,"who was described as a ""cat-lady"","
610d1cf3c7b4411f1643e501,6,she was found of cats
610d1cf3c7b4411f1643e501,7,and adopted at least twenty.
610d1cf3c7b4411f1643e501,8,"Her grandson tried to befriend the girl,"
610d1cf3c7b4411f1643e501,9,but she didn't catch on
610d1cf3c7b4411f1643e501,10,"as despite him being a good looking boy on the outside,"
610d1cf3c7b4411f1643e501,11,he had horrible manners.
610d1cf3c7b4411f1643e501,12,"One day, the boy said he would run away"
610d1cf3c7b4411f1643e501,13,"because his grandmother kept nagging him,"
610d1cf3c7b4411f1643e501,14,"on that day, the Grandmother came to the girl with cat in tow,"
610d1cf3c7b4411f1643e501,15,"asking her to help find her grandson,"
610d1cf3c7b4411f1643e501,16,"and so she did agree to go with her and find him,"
610d1cf3c7b4411f1643e501,17,"if they could not, she would call the police."
610d1cf3c7b4411f1643e501,18,"After scouring around, they found his baseball cap,"
610d1cf3c7b4411f1643e501,19,"despite finding the baseball cap,"
610d1cf3c7b4411f1643e501,20,treading further ahead yielded nothing other than locating a treehouse
610d1cf3c7b4411f1643e501,21,and they could not find the boy
610d1cf3c7b4411f1643e501,22,so they came back.
610d1cf3c7b4411f1643e501,23,"When they came back, they found him on a tree reading comic books."
610d1cf3c7b4411f1643e501,24,An officer warned the girl to not forget
610d1cf3c7b4411f1643e501,25,as the grandmother did not forget anything she saw or did.
63e51cdb4193829cb19b2ebf,1,About a woman
63e51cdb4193829cb19b2ebf,2,who tried to get close
63e51cdb4193829cb19b2ebf,3,and approach a guy
63e51cdb4193829cb19b2ebf,4,"in the neighborhood,"
63e51cdb4193829cb19b2ebf,5,but was said
63e51cdb4193829cb19b2ebf,6,that she never forget things easily.
60ac8e56161951beab26e5ea,1,Mrs Baker was the local cat lady
60ac8e56161951beab26e5ea,2,who had a grandson
60ac8e56161951beab26e5ea,3,who wanted to play with the narrator.
60ac8e56161951beab26e5ea,4,The grandson went missing
60ac8e56161951beab26e5ea,5,and he left a note.
60ac8e56161951beab26e5ea,6,Mrs Baker accused the narrator
60ac8e56161951beab26e5ea,7,and they went searching for him
60ac8e56161951beab26e5ea,8,only to find him in the treehouse.
60ac8e56161951beab26e5ea,9,The sheriff told the narrator to watch out
60ac8e56161951beab26e5ea,10,because Mrs Baker never forgets.
5e652bffbe3f4d000c66a42a,1,Mrs Baker is a cat lady.
5e652bffbe3f4d000c66a42a,2,She has a grandson
5e652bffbe3f4d000c66a42a,3,who tries to befriend the storyteller.
5e652bffbe3f4d000c66a42a,4,"However, she does not like him"
5e652bffbe3f4d000c66a42a,5,because he has bad manners.
5e652bffbe3f4d000c66a42a,6,He goes missing
5e652bffbe3f4d000c66a42a,7,and the cat lady asks for her help
5e652bffbe3f4d000c66a42a,8,to find him.
5e652bffbe3f4d000c66a42a,9,"He is, in fact, a member of a tree house club"
5e652bffbe3f4d000c66a42a,10,and had gone there.
5e652bffbe3f4d000c66a42a,11,"For reasons unclear, the local Sheriff tells her to lay low"
5e652bffbe3f4d000c66a42a,12,as it appears she has upset the cat lady.
5e652bffbe3f4d000c66a42a,13,So she does this.
608030a41cd2a2d7cabbba49,1,Mrs Baker was my neighbor who had cats.
608030a41cd2a2d7cabbba49,2,She adopted about twenty cats when I was a tomboy.
608030a41cd2a2d7cabbba49,3,She had a son who I suspect he did not like me because his mother nagged about me.
608030a41cd2a2d7cabbba49,4,One day he ran away.
608030a41cd2a2d7cabbba49,5,He left me a note.
608030a41cd2a2d7cabbba49,6,She came to my tree house and asked me to help her find him so I did.
608030a41cd2a2d7cabbba49,7,We went to where they found his cap by the windmill but he was not there.
608030a41cd2a2d7cabbba49,8,Then we went to his favourite spot and we found him sitting at a bench.
608030a41cd2a2d7cabbba49,9,So he did not run away.
608030a41cd2a2d7cabbba49,10,Later the sheriff came.
608030a41cd2a2d7cabbba49,11,"Officer said ""She is not someone who forgets when she puts her mind to it, so you need to lay low and stay out of sight""."
608030a41cd2a2d7cabbba49,12,So I laid low and stayed out of sight.

5e317d6d8c821b000aec84b3,7,"of which I was oblivious,"
5e317d6d8c821b000aec84b3,8,besides I didn't much like him

5e317d6d8c821b000aec84b3,10,One day
5e317d6d8c821b000aec84b3,11,because I didn't respond to his admiration

5e317d6d8c821b000aec84b3,13,Mrs Baker blamed me
5e317d6d8c821b000aec84b3,14,but after she came to my treehouse
5e317d6d8c821b000aec84b3,15,we decided to go looking for him.
5e317d6d8c821b000aec84b3,16,We went to where his baseball cap was found
5e317d6d8c821b000aec84b3,17,but we didn't find him.
5e317d6d8c821b000aec84b3,18,As we came back
5e317d6d8c821b000aec84b3,19,we saw him sitting on a tree branch

5e317d6d8c821b000aec84b3,21,he hadn't run away after all.
5e317d6d8c821b000aec84b3,22,The sheriff told me
5e317d6d8c821b000aec84b3,23,that I should lay low for a while
5e317d6d8c821b000aec84b3,24,as Mrs Baker was the type of old lady that didn't forget.
5e317d6d8c821b000aec84b3,25,"That's what I did,"
5e317d6d8c821b000aec84b3,26,I laid low.

5edd2d699c9855a147178414,5,a cat lady

60a2f63edb72812b711ba128,1,"Mrs baker, a cat lady had a son"
60a2f63edb72812b711ba128,2,who fancied the narrator.

60a2f63edb72812b711ba128,4,She was a tomboy
60a2f63edb72812b711ba128,5,so did not take a liking to him.
60a2f63edb72812b711ba128,6,He was said to be charming at first
60a2f63edb72812b711ba128,7,but he had extremely poor manners.
60a2f63edb72812b711ba128,8,"One day, he left a note saying that he was running away"
60a2f63edb72812b711ba128,9,because his mother would not stop nagging him about the narrator.
60a2f63edb72812b711ba128,10,She was in her treehouse
60a2f63edb72812b711ba128,11,when Mrs Baker came through with her cat in hand.
60a2f63edb72812b711ba128,12,She was upset
60a2f63edb72812b711ba128,13,and the narrator advised that they should go to the police and look for him.
60a2f63edb72812b711ba128,14,"After the search, they found him back on top of the treehouse reading a comic."
60a2f63edb72812b711ba128,15,This momentarily resolved the matter
60a2f63edb72812b711ba128,16,but the sherriff called the narrator to warn her about the fact that Mrs Baker does not forget anything easily.
60a2f63edb72812b711ba128,17,He advised that the narrator laid low
60a2f63edb72812b711ba128,18,and so the narrator did just that
60a2f63edb72812b711ba128,19,and Mrs Baker also laid low as a result.

5d1684b485233900157040d6,8,He had poor manners.
5d1684b485233900157040d6,9,Very very poor manners.
5d1684b485233900157040d6,10,One day he ran away
5d1684b485233900157040d6,11,because she was always nagging about me.
5d1684b485233900157040d6,12,She brought a tabby cat with her to my treehouse
5d1684b485233900157040d6,13,and wanted to get my advice.
5d1684b485233900157040d6,14,I told her we would look for him
5d1684b485233900157040d6,15,and if you couldn't find him
5d1684b485233900157040d6,16,she could you to the police.

5d1684b485233900157040d6,18,where we found his baseball cap.
5d1684b485233900157040d6,19,We found him a treehouse reading a comic book.
5d1684b485233900157040d6,20,The sheriff Dawson told me I should stay out of sight.
5d1684b485233900157040d6,21,"So I did,"
5d1684b485233900157040d6,22,that was the second time that happened.
5eb97e4abc41ad07dad1e3b5,1,There was a lady
5eb97e4abc41ad07dad1e3b5,2,who adopted loads of cats
5eb97e4abc41ad07dad1e3b5,3,20 of them
5eb97e4abc41ad07dad1e3b5,4,to remove eventually.
5eb97e4abc41ad07dad1e3b5,5,She had a grandson
5eb97e4abc41ad07dad1e3b5,6,who was a tomboy
5eb97e4abc41ad07dad1e3b5,7,and he had bad manners.

5eb97e4abc41ad07dad1e3b5,9,They looked everywhere
5eb97e4abc41ad07dad1e3b5,10,and found him sat in the tree house
5eb97e4abc41ad07dad1e3b5,11,reading a comic.
5eb97e4abc41ad07dad1e3b5,12,The lady said
5eb97e4abc41ad07dad1e3b5,13,if they didn't find him
5eb97e4abc41ad07dad1e3b5,14,she'd call the police.
5eb97e4abc41ad07dad1e3b5,15,The police said to the boy
5eb97e4abc41ad07dad1e3b5,16,to lie low
5eb97e4abc41ad07dad1e3b5,17,at some point
5eb97e4abc41ad07dad1e3b5,18,near the end of the story.
60e9bf5e0f34a7240c9955a8,1,"I had a neighbour called Mrs Baker,"
60e9bf5e0f34a7240c9955a8,2,who was the neighborhood cat lady.
60e9bf5e0f34a7240c9955a8,3,"She had a grandson,"
60e9bf5e0f34a7240c9955a8,4,"but I wasn't very fond of him,"
60e9bf5e0f34a7240c9955a8,5,"although, he tried to befriend me."
60e9bf5e0f34a7240c9955a8,6,"One day, she said he'd run away."
60e9bf5e0f34a7240c9955a8,7,We went looking for him
60e9bf5e0f34a7240c9955a8,8,"and found him in the treehouse club,"
60e9bf5e0f34a7240c9955a8,9,he hadn't run away at all.
60e9bf5e0f34a7240c9955a8,10,"The police officer, Officer Dawson, told me to lay low"
60e9bf5e0f34a7240c9955a8,11,as Mrs Baker doesn't forget anything once she's got something in her mind.
60e9bf5e0f34a7240c9955a8,12,So i did exactly that
60e9bf5e0f34a7240c9955a8,13,and it was the second time.
5cb1fdb11a4c6a0015fdcdf7,1,In my neighbourhood there was a lady

5cb1fdb11a4c6a0015fdcdf7,9,in my treehouse
5cb1fdb11a4c6a0015fdcdf7,10,with a tabby cat in tow
5cb1fdb11a4c6a0015fdcdf7,11,we went to find him
5cb1fdb11a4c6a0015fdcdf7,12,the place where he left his baseball cap
5cb1fdb11a4c6a0015fdcdf7,13,but he was sat on a branch
5cb1fdb11a4c6a0015fdcdf7,14,the officer came
5cb1fdb11a4c6a0015fdcdf7,15,and said he was safe
5cb1fdb11a4c6a0015fdcdf7,16,and not to tell the old woman
5cb1fdb11a4c6a0015fdcdf7,17,that was my second day.
5422cca4fdf99b328c91b21b,1,There was a lady
5422cca4fdf99b328c91b21b,2,who was a neighbour

5422cca4fdf99b328c91b21b,5,She wanted me to be friends with her grandson
5422cca4fdf99b328c91b21b,6,but he had really poor manners
5422cca4fdf99b328c91b21b,7,so I did not want to.
5422cca4fdf99b328c91b21b,8,One day she came to my house with her cat
5422cca4fdf99b328c91b21b,9,and said her grandson was missing
5422cca4fdf99b328c91b21b,10,I suggested we should look for him together before ringing the police.
5422cca4fdf99b328c91b21b,11,We went out
5422cca4fdf99b328c91b21b,12,and found him in a treehouse reading a comic
5422cca4fdf99b328c91b21b,13,he hadn't run away.
5422cca4fdf99b328c91b21b,14,The police called me later
5422cca4fdf99b328c91b21b,15,and said I should lay low
5422cca4fdf99b328c91b21b,16,"as she would cause trouble for me,"
5422cca4fdf99b328c91b21b,17,so that is what I did.
5e7c89a515980f2c5cf93d5d,1,There was a woman
5e7c89a515980f2c5cf93d5d,2,who had a neighbour

5e7c89a515980f2c5cf93d5d,4,about 20

5e7c89a515980f2c5cf93d5d,7,and then one day
5e7c89a515980f2c5cf93d5d,8,he said he was going to run away.
5e7c89a515980f2c5cf93d5d,9,The old lady made the girl go with her to look for him.
5e7c89a515980f2c5cf93d5d,10,They went to a mill
5e7c89a515980f2c5cf93d5d,11,but they didn't find him.

5e7c89a515980f2c5cf93d5d,16,as the woman would be cross with her for a while.
627966f3451caac7a46ca880,1,It was really confusing
627966f3451caac7a46ca880,2,someone's grandma liked cats
627966f3451caac7a46ca880,3,and went to a treehouse
627966f3451caac7a46ca880,4,to persuade the narrator to come down.
627966f3451caac7a46ca880,5,The grandson was rude

60603496c9a3d83273a11297,5,And he was trying to befriend me
60603496c9a3d83273a11297,6,but I didn't take of him.
60603496c9a3d83273a11297,7,He was a charming lad
60603496c9a3d83273a11297,8,until you saw his manners.
60603496c9a3d83273a11297,9,He had poor manners.
60603496c9a3d83273a11297,10,One day he left a note
60603496c9a3d83273a11297,11,saying he was going to run away
60603496c9a3d83273a11297,12,because she was nagging about me.

60603496c9a3d83273a11297,14,but if we can't find him
60603496c9a3d83273a11297,15,we can call the police.

60ed995abcc068230f3c604d,14,and lay low.
54232b4bfdf99b328c91b253,1,In the town that I grew up in
54232b4bfdf99b328c91b253,2,there was an old cat lady.
54232b4bfdf99b328c91b253,3,A boy was trying to befriend me
54232b4bfdf99b328c91b253,4,but I never caught on.
54232b4bfdf99b328c91b253,5,One day the old cat lady came to my treehouse
54232b4bfdf99b328c91b253,6,tabby cat in tow.
54232b4bfdf99b328c91b253,7,"She said the boy had run away,"
54232b4bfdf99b328c91b253,8,so we went to look for him.
54232b4bfdf99b328c91b253,9,We found his hat
54232b4bfdf99b328c91b253,10,and he was in a tree house.
54232b4bfdf99b328c91b253,11,He hadn't run away.
54232b4bfdf99b328c91b253,12,Then a sheriff turned up
54232b4bfdf99b328c91b253,13,and told me to lay low
54232b4bfdf99b328c91b253,14,as the old lady doesn't forget anything.
54232b4bfdf99b328c91b253,15,And so I laid low.
54232b4bfdf99b328c91b253,16,For the second time.
60f20aac9a3cd813c94175b4,1,"Mrs Baker was a cat lady,"
60f20aac9a3cd813c94175b4,2,"her grandson had bad manners,"
60f20aac9a3cd813c94175b4,3,goodness gracious did he have bad manners.
60f20aac9a3cd813c94175b4,4,Then there was a sheriff involved
60f20aac9a3cd813c94175b4,5,"and told her to lie low,"
60f20aac9a3cd813c94175b4,6,which she did
60f20aac9a3cd813c94175b4,7,and it was the second time.
60b2827157e043215e6f997e,1,In the neighborhood I stayed in
60b2827157e043215e6f997e,2,my nextdoor Mrs. Dawson had just bought a cat
60b2827157e043215e6f997e,3,but she owns 20 cats
60b2827157e043215e6f997e,4,I was a tomboy
60b2827157e043215e6f997e,5,and she lived with this charming lad
60b2827157e043215e6f997e,6,who wanted to run away
60b2827157e043215e6f997e,7,because she was a nagging lady
60b2827157e043215e6f997e,8,Mrs. Dawson came to me
60b2827157e043215e6f997e,9,to say he ran away
60b2827157e043215e6f997e,10,and found his baseball cap by the mill
60b2827157e043215e6f997e,11,but could not find him
60b2827157e043215e6f997e,12,we later went to the police station
60b2827157e043215e6f997e,13,to inform the chief about his disappearance
5f67ae1b22c41c0e44275dc2,1,"In the neighborhood I grew up in,"
5f67ae1b22c41c0e44275dc2,2,M. Baker was the local cat lady.
5f67ae1b22c41c0e44275dc2,3,She had many cats.
5f67ae1b22c41c0e44275dc2,4,"At that time, I was a bit of a tomboy."
5f67ae1b22c41c0e44275dc2,5,She had a son that liked me.
5f67ae1b22c41c0e44275dc2,6,He was fine - except his manners.
5f67ae1b22c41c0e44275dc2,7,He had terrible manners.
5f67ae1b22c41c0e44275dc2,8,I couldn't stand it.
5f67ae1b22c41c0e44275dc2,9,One day he got tired of his mother nagging him about me and took off.
5f67ae1b22c41c0e44275dc2,10,"Well she came up to my treehouse,"
5f67ae1b22c41c0e44275dc2,11,"huge tabby in tow,"
5f67ae1b22c41c0e44275dc2,12,and yelled at me to find him.
5f67ae1b22c41c0e44275dc2,13,I said I would help.
5f67ae1b22c41c0e44275dc2,14,We went to the place where his hat was found and looked all around.
5f67ae1b22c41c0e44275dc2,15,We continued searching and found nothing.
5f67ae1b22c41c0e44275dc2,16,Then the police called.
5f67ae1b22c41c0e44275dc2,17,We found him reading a comic book.
5f67ae1b22c41c0e44275dc2,18,He hadn't run away at all.
5f67ae1b22c41c0e44275dc2,19,But the police told me to lay low and stay out of trouble for a while.
60abb40fe8824c6f9007faeb,1,"In the neighborhood I grew up in,"
60abb40fe8824c6f9007faeb,2,Mrs. Baker was the resident lady.
60abb40fe8824c6f9007faeb,3,She had adopted at least two kids
60abb40fe8824c6f9007faeb,4,or she gave them a home.
60abb40fe8824c6f9007faeb,5,She had a young grandson
60abb40fe8824c6f9007faeb,6,and back then I was a tomboy.
60abb40fe8824c6f9007faeb,7,The grandson was trying to befriend me.
60abb40fe8824c6f9007faeb,8,I did not catch on him
60abb40fe8824c6f9007faeb,9,because he was charming.
5c7ceda01d2afc0001f4ad1d,1,"So our protagonist grew up in the same neighbourhood as Mrs. Baker,"
5c7ceda01d2afc0001f4ad1d,2,"whose grandson had a crush on our heroine,"
5c7ceda01d2afc0001f4ad1d,3,but which she was blissfully unaware of at the time.
5c7ceda01d2afc0001f4ad1d,4,One day Mrs Baker comes to our leading lady because her grandson has run away.
5c7ceda01d2afc0001f4ad1d,5,"So the pair go looking for him to no avail,"
5c7ceda01d2afc0001f4ad1d,6,but upon returning to our unnamed narrator's yard they find him sitting in a tree reading a comic book.
5c7ceda01d2afc0001f4ad1d,7,"All's well that ends well you would think,"
5c7ceda01d2afc0001f4ad1d,8,but Mrs Baker casts blame on the Girl With No Name for some such reason and threatens to call the police.
5c7ceda01d2afc0001f4ad1d,9,"So later an intrepid member of local enforcement arrives and leaves our teller of tales with the dubious legal advice of ""keeping her head low"" for some unfathomable reason,"
5c7ceda01d2afc0001f4ad1d,10,which she inexplicably agrees to do.
5c7ceda01d2afc0001f4ad1d,11,This was a chore to read.
5a099b6ca383a100011b49ec,1,"Mrs Baker, a woman with a lot of cats, had a grandson."
5a099b6ca383a100011b49ec,2,That grandson was quite fond of a girl (the narrator)
5a099b6ca383a100011b49ec,3,but the feeling wasn't reciprocated.
5a099b6ca383a100011b49ec,4,The boy ended up running away
5a099b6ca383a100011b49ec,5,"over the nagging from his grandmother,"
5a099b6ca383a100011b49ec,6,nagging about the relationship with the girl.
5a099b6ca383a100011b49ec,7,Mrs Baker went to see the girl
5a099b6ca383a100011b49ec,8,to confront her about the grandson running away.
5a099b6ca383a100011b49ec,9,They both went to look for him
5a099b6ca383a100011b49ec,10,"but, other than his baseball cap, found no sign."
5a099b6ca383a100011b49ec,11,"When they returned they found him sitting on a tree branch,"
5a099b6ca383a100011b49ec,12,reading a comic.
5a099b6ca383a100011b49ec,13,He hadn't run away.
5a099b6ca383a100011b49ec,14,For some reason a policeman told the girl to lay low
5a099b6ca383a100011b49ec,15,as Mrs Baker wouldn't forget what had happened easily.
60a65fa78c5f119da5e887e6,1,"In the neighbourhood that I grew up in,"
60a65fa78c5f119da5e887e6,2,there was an old lady called Mrs Baker.
60a65fa78c5f119da5e887e6,3,She had or gave homes to about 20 cats.
60a65fa78c5f119da5e887e6,4,"She had a grandson who tried to befriend me,"
60a65fa78c5f119da5e887e6,5,back then I was a tomboy.
60a65fa78c5f119da5e887e6,6,"Though he was nice to look at,"
60a65fa78c5f119da5e887e6,7,he had poor manners.
60a65fa78c5f119da5e887e6,8,Mrs Baker wanted us to be friends.
60a65fa78c5f119da5e887e6,9,"One day she came looking for me holding a toby cat,"
60a65fa78c5f119da5e887e6,10,she thought her grandson had run away.
60a65fa78c5f119da5e887e6,11,I told her I would help her look for him before calling the police.
60a65fa78c5f119da5e887e6,12,We went towards the old mill and saw his baseball cap.
60a65fa78c5f119da5e887e6,13,We found him sitting in the old treehouse reading a comic.
60a65fa78c5f119da5e887e6,14,"The sheriff came to see me later that day and told me to keep my distance from Mrs Baker,"
60a65fa78c5f119da5e887e6,15,which was the second time.
60a65fa78c5f119da5e887e6,16,So I did.
5e52886afe20872941fdbb0c,1,"In the neighborhood I grew up in,"
5e52886afe20872941fdbb0c,2,Mrs Baker was the resident cat lady.
5e52886afe20872941fdbb0c,3,She had twenty or so that she found homes for.
5e52886afe20872941fdbb0c,4,She had a grandson.
5e52886afe20872941fdbb0c,5,"He was a charming lad until you saw his manners,"
5e52886afe20872941fdbb0c,6,he had terrible manners.
5e52886afe20872941fdbb0c,7,One day he wrote a note saying he would run away
5e52886afe20872941fdbb0c,8,because she was always nagging him.
5e52886afe20872941fdbb0c,9,I told her to call the police
5e52886afe20872941fdbb0c,10,and she did.
5e52886afe20872941fdbb0c,11,They found his baseball cap
5e52886afe20872941fdbb0c,12,and no trace of him.
5e52886afe20872941fdbb0c,13,They found him sitting on a bench
5e52886afe20872941fdbb0c,14,with a comic book in his hand.
5e52886afe20872941fdbb0c,15,He hadn't ran away.
5e52886afe20872941fdbb0c,16,The sheriff told me to stay low
5e52886afe20872941fdbb0c,17,and out of sight
5e52886afe20872941fdbb0c,18,so that's what I did.
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,1,"In the neighborhood I grew up in,"
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,2,Mrs. Baker was the resident cat lady.
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,3,She had adopted at least twenty –
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,4,or had given them homes.
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,5,But she had –
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,6,a young grandson
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,7,and back then I was quite the tomboy.
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,8,"And apparently, he was trying to befriend me."
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,9,I never caught on.
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,10,Truth is I didn't take to him much because he had –
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,11,He was a charming lad until you saw his manners.
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,12,He had poor manners.
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,13,Goodness gracious he had poor manners.
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,14,Then he left a note one day saying he was going to run away because she was always nagging about me.
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,15,She came to my treehouse.
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,16,Big old tabby cat in tow.
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,17,"I talked her down and said “Well we'll go find him and if we can't locate him, you can –"
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,18,go ahead and call the police if you need to.”
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,19,I was strategizing.
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,20,So she took my advice.
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,21,And we went to where they found his baseball cap –
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,22,near the old mill
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,23,and we trailed a bit more
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,24,and we didn't find a trace.
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,25,And returned –
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,26,it was a treehouse club –
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,27,he was sitting on a branch with a comic book in his hand.
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,28,He hadn't run away.
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,29,But –
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,30,however –
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,31,that resolved it for that day.
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,32,"But that evening the local sheriff, Officer Dawson said “You better lay low and stay out of sight because that woman never forgets anything once she gets it into her mind.”"
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,33,And I did.
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,34,I laid low and stayed out of sight.
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,35,That was the second time.

609101a8a29bc713a6bcdbba,7,she wanted to run away
609101a8a29bc713a6bcdbba,8,because she was not happy.
609101a8a29bc713a6bcdbba,9,She was missing

609101a8a29bc713a6bcdbba,14,on branch of the tree
609101a8a29bc713a6bcdbba,15,holding a comic book.

5d5c250a0274020016e2333a,6,I was a tomboy
5d5c250a0274020016e2333a,7,and wasn't interested in the son
5d5c250a0274020016e2333a,8,but he had taken a liking to me.
5d5c250a0274020016e2333a,9,One day the son ran away
5d5c250a0274020016e2333a,10,"because of all of the arguments he had with his mum,"
5d5c250a0274020016e2333a,11,"about me,"
5d5c250a0274020016e2333a,12,and me and Mrs Baker went to look for him.
5d5c250a0274020016e2333a,13,We followed clues
5d5c250a0274020016e2333a,14,and eventually found him with a comic book
5d5c250a0274020016e2333a,15,and he hadn't run away.
5d5c250a0274020016e2333a,16,The local sheriff warned him to lie low in future.

5a27eee353fc4b0001414fe8,1,Mrs Baker was the neighbourhood cat lady

5a27eee353fc4b0001414fe8,5,She kept nagging
5a27eee353fc4b0001414fe8,6,so he made it look like he'd ran away.
5a27eee353fc4b0001414fe8,7,She got the narrator to help look for him
5a27eee353fc4b0001414fe8,8,"and they found his cap,"
5a27eee353fc4b0001414fe8,9,but not him.
5a27eee353fc4b0001414fe8,10,When they returned
5a27eee353fc4b0001414fe8,11,he was in the treehouse.
62a0b26aea67b76bd50c8ea5,1,When I was growing up there was a crazy old cat lady named Mrs. Baker.
62a0b26aea67b76bd50c8ea5,2,"She must have adopted 20 or so cats,"
62a0b26aea67b76bd50c8ea5,3,and rehomed even more.
62a0b26aea67b76bd50c8ea5,4,"She was always trying to get me with her grandson,"
62a0b26aea67b76bd50c8ea5,5,who had really bad manners.

62a0b26aea67b76bd50c8ea5,9,and his grandma came to my treehouse with a tabby cat in tow
62a0b26aea67b76bd50c8ea5,10,and said I had better go find him.
62a0b26aea67b76bd50c8ea5,11,I searched for hours
62a0b26aea67b76bd50c8ea5,12,"but couldn't find a trace of him other than his baseball cap,"
62a0b26aea67b76bd50c8ea5,13,so I told Mrs. Baker she had better call the police.
62a0b26aea67b76bd50c8ea5,14,"As we were on our way back home there he was, in the treehouse with a comic book."
62a0b26aea67b76bd50c8ea5,15,He hadn't ran away from home at all.
62a0b26aea67b76bd50c8ea5,16,"It seemed like everything was fine in the end,"
62a0b26aea67b76bd50c8ea5,17,but then the local sheriff Officer Blake came over
62a0b26aea67b76bd50c8ea5,18,and told me that I had better lay low and stay out of sight
62a0b26aea67b76bd50c8ea5,19,because that woman never forgot a thing when she set her mind on something.
62a0b26aea67b76bd50c8ea5,20,"So that's what I did,"
62a0b26aea67b76bd50c8ea5,21,I laid low and stayed out of sight.
62a0b26aea67b76bd50c8ea5,22,That was the second time.
5e1878b9a3d56c151399af37,1,"Discussing growing up,"
5e1878b9a3d56c151399af37,2,had a neighbour called Mrs Baker who was a cat lady.
5e1878b9a3d56c151399af37,3,She had about 20 cats she owned or took in at one point or another.
5e1878b9a3d56c151399af37,4,"She wanted me to befriend her grandson,"
5e1878b9a3d56c151399af37,5,though I didn't want to be his friend as he had terrible manners.
5e1878b9a3d56c151399af37,6,At the time I was a tomboy.
5e1878b9a3d56c151399af37,7,one day her grandson left a note that he was going  to run away
5e1878b9a3d56c151399af37,8,as Mrs baker always nagged him about me
5e1878b9a3d56c151399af37,9,and he had enough.
5e1878b9a3d56c151399af37,10,She came by the treehouse I liked to hang out in
5e1878b9a3d56c151399af37,11,"and asked for help to find him,"
5e1878b9a3d56c151399af37,12,I agreed to help
5e1878b9a3d56c151399af37,13,and if he could not be found by the end of the day we would alert the police.
5e1878b9a3d56c151399af37,14,We went to the mill where he liked to hang out
5e1878b9a3d56c151399af37,15,"and found his baseball cap,"
5e1878b9a3d56c151399af37,16,from there the trail went cold.
5e1878b9a3d56c151399af37,17,"We then found him at the treehouse club with a comic,"
5e1878b9a3d56c151399af37,18,he hadn't actually run off.
5e1878b9a3d56c151399af37,19,The sheriff told me to lay low for the rest of the summer when I got home
5e1878b9a3d56c151399af37,20,as Mrs Baker would never forget this
5e1878b9a3d56c151399af37,21,or forgive me.
606f66766e39073d51680a26,1,Someone lived in a neighbourhood
606f66766e39073d51680a26,2,with Mrs Baker
606f66766e39073d51680a26,3,"who had lots of cats,"
606f66766e39073d51680a26,4,at least 20
606f66766e39073d51680a26,5,but had rehomed some.
606f66766e39073d51680a26,6,Something about a treehouse
606f66766e39073d51680a26,7,and being a tomboy.
