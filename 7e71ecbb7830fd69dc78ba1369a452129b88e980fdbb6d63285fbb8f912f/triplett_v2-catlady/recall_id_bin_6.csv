One day Mrs Baker comes to our leading lady because her grandson has run away. So the pair go looking for him to no avail, but upon returning to our unnamed narrator's yard they find him sitting in a tree reading a comic book. All's well that ends well you would think, but Mrs Baker casts blame on the Girl With No Name for some such reason and threatens to call the police. So later an intrepid member of local enforcement arrives and leaves our teller of tales with the dubious legal advice of ""keeping her head low"" for some unfathomable reason, which she inexplicably agrees to do. This was a chore to read."
