She did this because she spotted a bee, hovering near my face - and she tried to save me from being stung. While being handed a glass of champagne carefully. She warned me and gave me a little shove and I fell into the water. I gasped for air and she started laughing. My beautiful dress was ruined. My cousin said that if it was a few more inches, I would have landed on the cake."
