Create a realistic illustration of a luxurious hotel garden scene following a humorous incident at a wedding reception. The setting is the same elegant garden with well-manicured lawns and decorations. In the foreground, near the garden pool, a woman who recently fell into the water now stands at the edge, dripping wet. She is wearing a simple, beautifully patterned dress in soft pastel pink, now drenched and clinging to her. Her hair is wet and flattened against her head, with slightly smudged makeup. She looks relieved but slightly frustrated. Her friend, standing next to her, is wearing a simple, elegant floor-length gown in a deep blue color. Her hair is styled in an elegant updo. She is laughing apologetically, with a hand raised to her mouth, conveying a mix of amusement and contrition. A towel is visible draped over a nearby chair, and wet footprints can be seen leading away from the pool. In the background, other guests are visible, some with amused expressions, pointing towards a distant, elegantly decorated wedding cake on a table, hinting at the narrator's narrow escape from landing on it.
