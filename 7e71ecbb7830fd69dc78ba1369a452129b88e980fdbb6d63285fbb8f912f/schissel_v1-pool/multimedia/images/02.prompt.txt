Create a realistic illustration of a humorous incident at a luxurious hotel garden wedding reception. The setting features elegant decorations, ambient lighting, and a lively atmosphere. In the foreground, a woman stands near the edge of a tranquil garden pool, wearing a simple white dress. A bee can be seen hovering near her face, prompting her friend to react. In her effort to swat the bee away, the friend inadvertently pushes her into the pool. The woman flails her arms, her glass of champagne tipping precariously as she loses her balance, about to cause a splash. The friend, wearing a simple, elegant floor-length gown in a deep blue color, stands nearby, caught between shock and amusement as she realizes the outcome of her action. In the background, guests in formal attire react with surprise or amusement, framing the elegant reception setting with greenery and decorative lights enhancing the evening scene.
