0,1,Someone and their partner were driving on Twenty Four
0,2,"to a softball game at the church,"
0,3,when they noticed a guy was tailing their car.
0,4,"They tried to lose him,"
0,5,but he continued tailing them.
0,6,"However, the other guy crashed his car,"
0,7,and he didn't move.
0,8,"Not wanting to leave the man to die,"
0,9,"though, they called the police,"
0,10,who turned up soon enough.
0,11,The other man drove off
0,12,and was never caught.
1,1,A man was in the car
1,2,"with a woman named Lisa,"
1,3,going to watch a softball game
1,4,driving down the Twenty-Four.
1,5,A man in his mid fifties was pulling in
1,6,from somewhere
1,7,blocking the road
1,8,with his car on the Twenty-Four
1,9,when the driver in the car with Lisa drove in
1,10,and overtook him.
1,11,The man in his mid fifties began following their car
1,12,"bumper to bumper,"
1,13,swaying between the two lanes on the road.
1,14,"The driver and Lisa thought the man was either drunk,"
1,15,"which led him to think about how drunk driving is a major killer of young people on the roads,"
1,16,or the man was either sick
1,17,having a heart attack or something similar.
1,18,The driver didn't want to somehow read the papers the next day
1,19,and find out the mid fifties man had actually suffered a heart attack
1,20,"and died as a result,"
1,21,thinking he was actually just drunk driving.
1,22,Soon they see a Sheriff nearby while driving
1,23,and so he waves to the sheriff to get his attention
1,24,and pull over
1,25,and tells him about the mid fifties man following them
1,26,and that he's either sick or drunk
1,27,and to go check on him.
1,28,As soon as the deputy approaches the mid fifties man's car
1,29,he begins to put his car in reverse
1,30,and go backwards as quickly as possible.
1,31,The driver and Lisa appear humoured
1,32,and not knowing whether the police had ever caught or reached the man in his fifties.
2,1,About a week ago I was headed to a softball game at Homestead Diamond put on by my church.
2,2,I was driving down Twenty-Four
2,3,"and was waiting to turn,"
2,4,but a car started going for the spot at the same time.
2,5,I quickly drove past him
2,6,and he just stayed stopped blocking the highway.
2,7,Then the driver started following us.
2,8,I was with my friend Lisa
2,9,"and she said the vehicle was right on my tail, like almost bumper to bumper."
2,10,And he was driving all over the place
2,11,and not staying in his lane.
2,12,"I thought for sure he was drunk,"
2,13,and that I should turn around and confront him.
2,14,"But then I thought that he could also have a medical problem, like maybe he was having a heart attack,"
2,15,and I didn't want to read the news the next day
2,16,and see that someone died while having a heart attack
2,17,and I could have done something to help them.
2,18,Part of me also didn't want to do anything
2,19,"but by then, I had already made up my mind to confront him."
2,20,"Then I saw a sheriff on the other side of the road,"
2,21,so I stopped and motioned for him to come over.
2,22,I told the sheriff that the man behind me was driving erratically
2,23,"and couldn't stay on one side of the road,"
2,24,"and that he was either drunk or having a heart attack,"
2,25,but was having some kind of problem.
2,26,When I stopped to talk to the sheriff
2,27,the driver of the vehicle stopped a ways down the road.
2,28,"Then when the sheriff drove after him, he started driving the road in reverse."
2,29,Then the driver turned the car around
2,30,"and started driving the right way,"
2,31,with the sheriff following.
2,32,He was driving really slow
2,33,and it was such a funny thing to witness.
2,34,I'm not sure if the sheriff ever stopped the driver of the vehicle.
4,1,About a month ago a man was going to play softball near a church
4,2,and was travelling with his wife in their car
4,3,when they turned on highway 24
4,4,a man in a car behind them was also trying to turn at the same time
4,5,and was following them
4,6,and weaving about in the road behind them.
4,7,He thought the man was drunk or ill
4,8,and was going to go back to the car behind him
4,9,when they stopped at the next junction.
4,10,He saw a police car
4,11,and waved the officers over
4,12,and told them about the man
4,13,and they went down the road to investigate.
4,14,The driver turned his car around
4,15,and the police followed him.
4,16,The man did not know if the man was caught by the police or not.
5,1,"On their way to a softball event at the diamonds,"
5,2,the main character was driving on 24 lane or road.
5,3,He has a girl named Lisa in the car.
5,4,Another man stops at the intersection
5,5,and blocks off traffic.
5,6,The main character goes past
5,7,and the man follows.
5,8,The driver behind them is driving weirdly
5,9,so the main character assumes he is drunk.
5,10,Then he assumes he is maybe sick
5,11,and should check him out in case the newspaper says a man had a heart attack
5,12,and the main character could've helped.
5,13,"The MC stops the car,"
5,14,"spots a sheriff’s car,"
5,15,and calls them over.
5,16,He tells the deputy to check the other driver out.
5,17,"When the driver saw the MC talking to the police,"
5,18,"he reversed,"
5,19,the police followed.
5,20,Then he went forward
5,21,and the police had to make a u-turn.
5,22,The MC thought this was comical.
5,23,He wasn't sure if the other driver was caught or not.
6,1,We were going up to twenty four
6,2,when this guy around the age of 50 starts following me
6,3,"bumper to bumper,"
6,4,at first I didn't take it serious
6,5,but he was too close that I was worried
6,6,that he might hit me.
6,7,"I decided that at the next intersection I am going to confront him,"
6,8,I mean what if he is drunk
6,9,and major accidents are caused by drunk driving
6,10,and he can't even keep to one lane.
6,11,I didn't want to get involved
6,12,"but I have to,"
6,13,"also what if he is having a heart attack,"
6,14,I don't want to read on the news that he died
6,15,while I could have done something about it.
6,16,At the next stop sight I jumped out
6,17,"and informed a sheriff about him,"
6,18,"""that man is either drunk or is having a health problem,"
6,19,he has been following me for a while now
6,20,"and he can't keep on his lane."""
6,21,Seeing that I was talking to the police
6,22,he stopped way far
6,23,and started reversing
6,24,and the police started chasing him.
7,1,A driver and their passenger named Lisa are driving to a baseball game on Egg Ranch Hill.
7,2,"On the way, another driver attempts to cut them off on the 24 highway."
7,3,The other driver proceeds to drive erratically behind them.
7,4,"At first, the driver assumes he is drunk."
7,5,It's his responsibility to report it.
7,6,The driver then considers he may be sick.
7,7,Possibly having a heart attack.
7,8,The driver fears he will regret not doing anything if the man is sick.
7,9,He hears about it after-the-fact.
7,10,He decides to stop and confront him.
7,11,"When only a few miles from the baseball diamond, the driver spots a sheriff."
7,12,He stops to speak with him.
7,13,He addresses his issues with the other driver.
7,14,"As the other driver nears, he spies the sheriff."
7,15,"He turns his car, driving away."
7,16,The sheriff proceeds after him.
7,17,The other driver now driving cautiously.
7,18,The driver does not know what happened after that.
8,1,A person was driving
8,2,and [they] turned right at the Egg Road house.
8,3,Then [they] noticed a person was driving poorly behind them
8,4,and they started to either think
8,5,‘this guy is drunk’
8,6,or ‘[this guy is] having a heart attack.’
8,7,Since they didn't want to read the newspaper tomorrow
8,8,and see ‘man died of heart attack’
8,9,she flagged down the cops
8,10,to let them know that ‘this guy has a problem’
8,11,and then the poor driver started to drive backwards
8,12,and eventually the police caught up to them.
8,13,[I am] not sure what happened to the guy in the end
8,14,"though, but it was funny!"
9,1,All I can remember is drink driving
9,2,number 24
9,3,he was blocking with his car
9,4,and that drink driving is the main cause
9,5,of driving related deaths
11,1,Someone and a girl named Lisa are on their way to a church softball game.
11,2,They're near highway 24.
11,3,There's a man in his mid-fifties.
11,4,That is edging out.
11,5,And blocking the intersection.
11,6,The guy and Lisa manage to get out ahead of him.
11,7,Then they notice that the older man is behind them.
11,8,And he is driving really close to them.
11,9,And cannot maintain a lane.
11,10,They think that he is either drunk or sick.
11,11,He doesn't really want to stop.
11,12,But also doesn't want to hear about a man dying.
11,13,Because he was sick.
11,14,And he didn't help them.
11,15,So they're about to pull over.
11,16,And they see a sheriff's car.
11,17,Which they wave down.
11,18,They tell the Sheriff that the man behind them is either sick or drunk.
11,19,When the man behind them sees the Sheriff.
11,20,He puts his car in reverse.
11,21,And starts backing away.
11,22,Then he drives away.
11,23,With the Sheriff after him.
11,24,The storyteller and Lisa never found out if the man was caught.
11,25,And there was something about Ranch Eggs.
11,26,Which I didn't understand.
12,1,They were going to a church diamond league softball game at the high school
12,2,and they were going up 24
12,3,and they were getting ready to turn at the ranch eggs.
12,4,They put on their turn signals
12,5,and went over.
12,6,There was a guy in his mid fifties
12,7,who was blocking the lane
12,8,and headed to the same spot as they were going
12,9,and they said you jerk
12,10,and they got ahead of him.
12,11,The guy who was blocking the lane starts following them
12,12,"and Lisa the friend said, ""This guy is on your tail."""
12,13,He starts weaving back and forth
12,14,and this lead him to thinking the guy could be a drunk driver
12,15,and how it is the number 1 killer of kids
12,16,and that it is everyone's responsibility to report drunk driving.
12,17,Then he thinks maybe they were having a heart attack
12,18,and that he would feel guilty if he read the paper
12,19,and saw a man had died of a heart attack
12,20,and then he motioned at the police to come towards him.
12,21,He then tells the police that the guy behind him is either drunk or sick.
12,22,"As the police moved towards him,"
12,23,the guy started backing away.
12,24,The police pursued him
12,25,but don't know what the result was.
13,1,"The driver was driving somewhere,"
13,2,"with someone called Lisa,"
13,3,"and there was another car ahead,"
13,4,"blocking the junction,"
13,5,holding up the traffic.
13,6,Somehow the driver of this car ended up behind the first driver
13,7,and he was weaving in and out.
13,8,"The first driver was concerned that the other driver was drunk,"
13,9,"or ill,"
13,10,and he was concerned about an accident happening.
13,11,He pulled up by some police officers (sheriffs)
13,12,and told them what had happened.
13,13,They then went back down the road
13,14,to speak to this other driver
13,15,"but he then reversed his car back down the road,"
13,16,did a u-turn
13,17,and then proceeded to drive very slowly.
13,18,The first driver found this funny
13,19,and wondered whether the police ever got to speak to the other driver.
14,1,Going to the baseball diamond
14,2,on ranch eggs.
14,3,Took the twenty four.
14,4,There was an erratic driver
14,5,swerving and blocking traffic
14,6,in the median.
14,7,Went to report him
14,8,and once the sheriffs started following him
14,9,he started driving more carefully.
15,1,I was driving
15,2,and a person was driving erratically
15,3,and I thought the person was drunk
15,4,but then thought maybe they're having a medical emergency.
15,5,I got the sheriff's attention
15,6,and it was pretty comical.
16,1,When I was going to a church football game
16,2,I saw a guy driving a car.
16,3,He stopped at a junction and blocked it.
16,4,He could not seem to keep on one side of the road.
16,5,I thought he must be drunk
16,6,"and wanted to get away from him,"
16,7,"then I thought, what if he is sick?"
16,8,I would feel terrible to read in the newspaper tomorrow
16,9,that he had died from a heart attack
16,10,and I had done nothing about it.
16,11,"Just then I spotted a sheriff's car,"
16,12,so I went over to him
16,13,and told him that the guy in the car down the road was either drunk or sick
16,14,as he could not keep his car on one side of the road.
16,15,As soon as the guy in the car saw me walking over to the sheriff's car
16,16,he started reversing.
16,17,The sheriff drove towards him.
16,18,The guy started driving carefully.
16,19,The sheriff followed him.
16,20,I have no idea if they ever stopped him or not.
17,1,There was a person driving on the freeway
17,2,and [they were] heading to a hill
17,3,when they noticed a suspicious driver.
17,4,He started by attempting to cut the driver off
17,5,however they managed to get in before him.
17,6,"Once further ahead,"
17,7,the passenger noticed the driver tailing them closely.
17,8,"After a while,"
17,9,they notice a police car
17,10,and gesture [to] them to come over.
17,11,[To] the car they share the information that the driver is either unwell or drunk.
17,12,The police make the decision to follow the mysterious driver
17,13,while he slowly drives away.
18,1,"We were going to the baseball diamond,"
18,2,and the High School.
18,3,"And we were driving up 25th,"
18,4,and we come to an intersection where this guy is coming from 24th.
18,5,"And he tries to get in right in the median,"
18,6,where people turn from you know.
18,7,"And I think ""you jerk"""
18,8,but I manage to get in front of him.
18,9,"Then we head up 25th,"
18,10,"up the hill,"
18,11,by Egg Ranch.
18,12,"And this guy, looks to be middle fifties, is right on my tail."
18,13,"Lisa looked back there and said ""He's right on your tail!"""
18,14,"And sure enough, we're basically bumper to bumper."
18,15,"And he can't keep his truck straight,"
18,16,in and out of the lane.
18,17,So I think he must be drunk.
18,18,And all I can think is how drunk driving is the number one killer on the roads.
18,19,And how it's everyone's responsibility.
18,20,"That or maybe he's having a medical problem, like a heart attack."
18,21,I just know it would kill me if I read in the papers the next day about a guy dying from a heart attack on the road.
18,22,He could be having a heart attack and here I am thinking he's drunk.
18,23,So I feel like I have to do something.
18,24,We're coming up to a stop sign
18,25,"and I decide that when I stop,"
18,26,I'm going to get out
18,27,and go see what's going on.
18,28,"Either he's drunk or having a medical problem,"
18,29,and I decided I needed to help.
18,30,I don't really want to get involved
18,31,but I feel like I have to.
18,32,So I stop at the stop sign.
18,33,"And across the intersection, a police car has pulled up."
18,34,"So I wave him over,"
18,35,and I get out of the car.
18,36,And I tell the deputy that either this guy behind me is drunk or having a definite medical problem
18,37,because he's swerving across the lanes.
18,38,"But the driver saw me get out and talk to the deputy,"
18,39,"and now he's stopped way back, far back from my car."
18,40,Ha ha.
18,41,"Then as the deputy is walking down there to talk to him, he starts backing up."
18,42,"And then he pulls a u turn,"
18,43,and the police car follows him.
18,44,But he's going real slow and careful down the road.
18,45,It was quite comical.
18,46,I don't know if they ever managed to pull him over.
19,1,"A guy and his friend, Lisa, were driving to a ball game."
19,2,They were on Highway 24.
19,3,"While on the highway, a guy pulls out in front of them."
19,4,He completely blocks the highway.
19,5,The driver manages to get around him.
19,6,Lisa says he is right on their tail.
19,7,The driver sees that he is driving erratically.
19,8,"They are near ""Ranch Eggs"" when the driver sees a stop sign ahead."
19,9,He sees that there is a cop car ahead.
19,10,He figures he will get the attention of the cop.
19,11,He is concerned that the driver might be drunk.
19,12,He is concerned that this is everyone's responsibility to take action.
19,13,He really didn't want to get involved.
19,14,He decided he was going to anyway.
19,15,He thought maybe the driver was drunk or sick.
19,16,He thought perhaps he was having a heart attack.
19,17,He didn't want to hear on the news that a person died of a heart attack.
19,18,He didn't want to hear that he did nothing.
19,19,He calls the cop over to his car.
19,20,He tells him the other driver has a problem.
19,21,He tells him the other driver could be drunk or sick.
19,22,The other driver had stopped a ways back from the car.
19,23,The cops approach the other car.
19,24,The guy does a u-turn.
19,25,The guy drives cautiously away.
19,26,The police followed.
19,27,The guy didn't know if he was ever caught.
19,28,The guy found the whole thing funny.
21,1,They were on their way to a church baseball game at diamond.
21,2,A car was blocking the road.
21,3,People had to go around the car.
21,4,"When they finally got to go around the car,"
21,5,the car that was blocking the road started following them.
21,6,They were riding the car's butt.
21,7,[They were] swerving all over the road.
21,8,The driver thought that maybe the other driver was drunk.
21,9,[The driver thought that] something bad was happening like him having a heart attack.
21,10,The driver decided that at the stop sign he was going to get out.
21,11,[The driver decided] to see what the other driver's problem was.
21,12,"When he got to the stop sign,"
21,13,he noticed a police officer.
21,14,[He] waved him over.
21,15,He told the cop that the car behind him was either drunk.
21,16,[He told the cop that] something was wrong with him.
21,17,The other driver then started to back away.
21,18,[The other driver] tried to get away from the cops.
22,1,"Driver with Melanie was driving on a highway,"
22,2,somewhere near twenty four
22,3,"when a guy was blocking the highway,"
22,4,he then proceeded to follow them
22,5,and driver was concerned
22,6,as to whether he was drunk or having a heart attack
22,7,so stopped the sheriff.
23,1,There is a lady driving in the road
23,2,with her friend Lisa.
23,3,They recall that two months ago
23,4,they were supposed to go and watch a softball game.
23,5,As they are driving
23,6,they realize that someone is driving suspiciously close to them.
23,7,Lisa even said he was on their tail.
23,8,He was very close
23,9,such that it was bumper to bumper.
23,10,They continued on the road
23,11,and turned onto the road called twenty-four
23,12,and the man followed them still.
23,13,They realized that he was weaving
23,14,"and could not keep to one side of the road,"
23,15,he was not keeping to his lane.
23,16,At this point they thought
23,17,that he was either drunk or sick
23,18,for example having a heart-attack.
23,19,They called the cops on him
23,20,and as he saw police approaching his car
23,21,"he had parked at a distance,"
23,22,he started driving in reverse.
23,23,The cops started chasing him
23,24,and this is where the story ends
23,25,as the two ladies also never got to know
23,26,if the police caught up with the driver.
24,1,Something about a guy
24,2,on his way to a game
24,3,"and he's stuck in traffic,"
24,4,then something about a driver
24,5,driving erratically.
24,6,Narrator is wondering
24,7,whether he is drunk
24,8,or having a medical emergency.
24,9,Ends up talking
24,10,to a cop
24,11,about it.
25,1,I was driving to a baseball game with Lisa
25,2,when a middle-aged man pulled up into the lane beside me.
25,3,He was angry
25,4,I did not let him into my lane
25,5,so he blocked a lane
25,6,and then proceeded to tailgate me for several miles.
25,7,As we approached our destination
25,8,I got to a stop sign
25,9,and saw a police car.
25,10,When I got out of my car to tell the police about his erratic driving
25,11,the other driver backed up down the road.
25,12,The police chased the other driver
25,13,but I am not sure
25,14,they ever caught up with him.
26,1,they were going to a baseball game with Lisa
26,2,a car stopped in the middle of the highway
26,3,and almost rear-ended them
26,4,then at first they thought maybe he was drunk
26,5,because of how he was driving
26,6,then he felt bad
26,7,and thought he may be having a heart attack
26,8,The guy was reversing into them now
26,9,They called the police
26,10,and told them he was either drunk or having a heart attack
26,11,as first he was on their bumper
26,12,then he was reversing into them
26,13,The police arrive
26,14,and the car in question now slows down
26,15,and drives normal
27,1,I was heading to the church softball field
27,2,"To be honest, all I can remember is that they were driving to the game"
27,3,A guy pulled out and blocked traffic on 24 highway
27,4,and they went around
27,5,He started following them
27,6,and got right up on his bumper
27,7,but he was weaving in and out of the lane
27,8,The first driver thought he should stop at the next stop sign
27,9,and find out what the other driver's problem was
27,10,He thought he was either drunk or sick
27,11,"Once he stopped, he noticed a sheriff in his car"
27,12,and signaled him over
27,13,He told the officer what was going on
27,14,and the officer started towards the other car
27,15,The driver of that car threw it in reverse
27,16,and started backing down the road
27,17,with the officer following him
27,18,He then slammed on his brakes
27,19,and changed gears
27,20,and moved forward
27,21,The officer did a U-turn
27,22,and continued to follow the driver
27,23,"By the way, there was a girl named Lisa in the car with the original driver"
28,1,The speaker and a woman are in a car driving.
28,2,They pass by a car that is stopped at an intersection at a stop sign on 24th street.
28,3,A man around his 50s is driving the car.
28,4,The man and woman pass the other driver and keep driving.
28,5,"The car then comes up behind them,"
28,6,"and the woman tells the speaker that the other car is driving really close, bumper-to-bumper."
28,7,"Also, the other car is also swaying side to side,"
28,8,very dangerously.
28,9,"The speaker recalls thinking that the driver of the car behind them might be drunk,"
28,10,or maybe having a medical emergency.
28,11,So the speaker decides to confront them the next time they come up to a stop sign.
28,12,"When they arrive at an intersection,"
28,13,the driver spots a police car on the other side of the road.
28,14,The speaker gets out of the car
28,15,and catches the police's attention
28,16,and explains to them the reckless driving the other car is doing.
28,17,"The other car is suddenly going very slowly,"
28,18,and then starts reversing when the speaker is speaking to the police.
28,19,The police then go back to their car
28,20,and try to catch up to the reckless driver.
28,21,The speaker doesn't know if the police ever caught the reckless driver or not.
29,1,"Heading to a baseball game in a church league,"
29,2,I'm heading down 24 headed to Ranch Eggs diamond
29,3,and this car starts to pull out onto the highway.
29,4,He eventually blocks the entire highway
29,5,and I get around him.
29,6,Eventually he's tailgating me
29,7,and following me really close like bumper to bumper.
29,8,"Even Lisa says ""He's trying really close to you."""
29,9,He also begins to weave around the road
29,10,and I think at this point that he's probably drunk.
29,11,I was about to dismiss them
29,12,but then I think that maybe they're sick or having a heart attack.
29,13,I'd to read the paper the next day
29,14,and realize he died because he had a heart attack.
29,15,As soon as we reach the next intersection at a stop sign
29,16,I see a sheriff's car across the road
29,17,and get out to tell them that I think the guy behind me is either drunk or sick
29,18,as he was weaving all over the road while tailgating me.
29,19,The sheriff starts walking to the car behind me
29,20,and he slowly starts reversing back down the highway.
29,21,The sheriff gets in their car
29,22,"and starts down the road,"
29,23,and the other driver put his car in drive
29,24,and starts slowly moving forward.
29,25,The sheriff does a U-turn
29,26,and at that point I'm not sure what happened with the driver.
30,1,A guy is heading to a church softball game
30,2,at Homestead School
30,3,with his friend Lisa
30,4,when he encounters a person
30,5,driving poorly
30,6,and sometimes following him
30,7,on the 24.
30,8,He is concerned
30,9,this person may be drunk
30,10,"or possibly sick,"
30,11,maybe even a heart attack.
30,12,When coming across a sheriff car
30,13,he informs them.
30,14,The sheriff attempts to follow
30,15,as the suspect drives slowly
30,16,and true.
30,17,The man did not ever find out
30,18,what the situation was.
31,1,You were driving to the softball league along highway 24.
31,2,This guy starts weaving between traffic.
31,3,[He] starts to follow you.
31,4,Your friend Lisa is in the car.
31,5,[Lisa] also thinks that this guy is following you.
31,6,You don't know if he is drunk.
31,7,[You don't know if] he is having a heart attack.
31,8,[So] you decide to stop.
31,9,[You decide] to check it out.
31,10,"As you stop, you notice a police sheriff."
31,11,[So] you get him to come over.
31,12,[You] explain [it] to him.
31,13,They then notice that the guy has reversed slowly down the road.
31,14,"As they follow, [he] starts to drive normally."
32,1,This is a story about how there were these two individuals
32,2,who were going to a church softball game (not sure if I am right).
32,3,They were in the car
32,4,on their way to the game
32,5,when they had issues on the road
32,6,with an elderly man
32,7,who seemed to have been drunk driving or sick.
32,8,The man could not stay in one lane
32,9,and was going over towards their car.
32,10,The narrator talks about trying to get away from the man
32,11,by going up a hill.
32,12,The man seems to follow them
32,13,to the point he was bumper to bumper with them.
32,14,The narrator talks to the passenger called Lisa
32,15,and tells her that they suspect that the man is drunk or might be experiencing a heart attack.
32,16,The narrator thinks of ways to help this man
32,17,as they did not want the man to get hurt
32,18,or appear in the headlines as someone who got hurt.
32,19,They look around
32,20,and see a sheriff's car not too far.
32,21,They try to go towards the sheriff.
32,22,The narrator gets out of the car
32,23,and tells the sheriff what is going on.
32,24,"They see the car of the man slowing down,"
32,25,the sheriff goes into their car
32,26,and chases after the man
32,27,and the story ends there.
33,1,"Someone was on their way to a softball game at high school,"
33,2,something to do with a twenty-fourth.
33,3,"They were waiting for a space,"
33,4,"but there was bad traffic,"
33,5,and someone cut them up.
33,6,"They drove on,"
33,7,"and the person that cut them up started following them,"
33,8,"driving dangerously,"
33,9,and tailing them.
33,10,"They thought this person was either drunk or sick,"
33,11,"so decided at the next traffic light they would stop,"
33,12,"and get out,"
33,13,and check.
33,14,"When they hit the next light,"
33,15,"there was a police car there,"
33,16,"so they called the police over,"
33,17,and explained what was happening.
33,18,"The car that was tailing them saw the police,"
33,19,"and reversed to go the other way,"
33,20,"driving overly slowly,"
33,21,and overly cautiously now they knew they were being watched.
33,22,The story teller never found out whether they were stopped by the police or not.
34,1,A couple were at a baseball game
34,2,and then left.
34,3,They went to highway 44
34,4,and came across a strange driver
34,5,who tailgated them.
34,6,When they had a chance
34,7,to hail a police car
34,8,they did.
34,9,The police then investigated.
35,1,They were going to a church baseball game at the diamond
35,2,and were on Highway 24.
35,3,A guy blocked the highway
35,4,and the narrator moved into the median before the guy.
35,5,The guy then followed the narrator down the road to the diamond
35,6,about a mile or two past Ranch Eggs.
35,7,The guy was swerving
35,8,and the narrator thought he was drunk or sick.
35,9,Lisa pointed out the guy was really close.
35,10,The narrator stopped at a stop sign
35,11,and motioned the cops over.
36,1,There were driving to a church softball league game at the Diamond at Homestead High.
36,2,They were driving up 22
36,3,and were about to make a turn near Egg Ranch (?)
36,4,when a guy pulled across into the median
36,5,and started blocking the 24.
36,6,They noticed that the guy must have a problem.
36,7,They first thought he must be drunk
36,8,but then thought he might be sick -
36,9,having a heart attack or something.
36,10,They didn't want to read in the paper that a guy had died of a heart attack
36,11,when they could have done something by checking
36,12,so they decided they would check out what was happening
36,13,even though they didn't want to get involved.
36,14,They said to Lisa who was in the car that the guy behind them had some problem
36,15,and couldn't stay on one side of the road.
36,16,They made a decision to stop at the stop sign a mile or 2 down the road
36,17,and get out the car
36,18,and see what was happening in the car behind.
36,19,When they got to the stop sign a police patrol car pulled up on the opposite side at the same time
36,20,so they waved the Deputy over.
36,21,They explained to the Deputy that the guy in the car behind seemed to either be drunk or sick
36,22,as they were unable to keep their vehicle on one side of the road.
36,23,When they got out the car to speak to the Deputy
36,24,they noticed the other car had stopped a ways back
36,25,and was now slowing reversing back down the road away from them.
36,26,The police car then drove towards them
36,27,and they pulled a U-turn
36,28,and drove away faster.
36,29,The story narrator never found out what happened to them.
37,1,We were on our way to a softball league game.
37,2,Pulling up twenty four interstate.
37,3,They see another driver behind them.
37,4,Who they suspect was ill or drunk.
37,5,Call the sheriffs over.
37,6,To try and stop the man.
37,7,As they didn't want to be known as the person who did nothing.
37,8,The sheriff tries to signal them down.
37,9,But they go into reverse.
37,10,And then forward.
37,11,After it was comical.
38,1,"Driving to a softball game,"
38,2,I came across another car driving erratically.
38,3,"I wasn't sure if the driver was drunk or sick,"
38,4,but I knew I had to do something.
38,5,I spoke to the police
38,6,who headed towards the other car
38,7,which had stopped in the road.
38,8,The other car noticed
38,9,and started reversing
38,10,before turning around
38,11,and driving away slowly and carefully
38,12,while being followed by the police.
38,13,"I don't know what became of that car,"
38,14,or its driver.
39,1,"Two months ago on a Sunday,"
39,2,I was driving for a game
39,3,and we passed a car.
39,4,"He was sitting right there in the middle of the highway,"
39,5,"so when the traffic cleared,"
39,6,I went ahead
39,7,"and was getting near diamond close to twenty-four,"
39,8,then we noticed he was following us bumper to bumper.
39,9,I didn't notice at first
39,10,but my friend Lisa drew my attention to it.
39,11,I kept my eye on him
39,12,so that he doesn't bump into me.
39,13,"He kept driving crazy,"
39,14,moving from one lane to another.
39,15,I had a lot of thoughts about drunk driving
39,16,and how it can cause accidents
39,17,and I thought he is definitely drunk.
39,18,"However, my mind kept bugging me"
39,19,"and I thought again,"
39,20,he could be ill or having a heart attack.
39,21,"Either way, I need to check on him"
39,22,to prevent any mishap.
39,23,I didn't want to feel guilty if something happened
39,24,so I made up my mind to truly check.
39,25,"Suddenly, I saw the sheriff's car"
39,26,and I signaled them to come over.
39,27,"When they did,"
39,28,"I told them that something was wrong with the guy behind me,"
39,29,like he was drunk or ill.
39,30,"Apparently, when I stopped,"
39,31,he also stopped a few miles behind me.
39,32,"When they were approaching him,"
39,33,"he reversed,"
39,34,they kept following him
39,35,and he kept reversing
39,36,until they had him backed in a corner.
39,37,"When he realized he was being cornered,"
39,38,"he started driving forward,"
39,39,they had to do a U-turn
39,40,and start a pursuit of him.
39,41,Till date I don't know
39,42,if they stopped or caught him.
40,1,It's the story of a guy
40,2,that's driving to go attend a softball game.
40,3,"While he's driving on road Twenty-Four,"
40,4,he meets another driver driving very dangerously.
40,5,That driver is constantly moving between the lanes
40,6,and following his car too closely.
40,7,The guy isn't sure
40,8,if the dangerous driver is drunk
40,9,"or sick,"
40,10,and if he is sick
40,11,he would feel bad
40,12,if something bad happened to him.
40,13,So he goes to see the cops for help
40,14,and they start chasing the dangerous driver.
40,15,The person telling the story doesn't know
40,16,if they ever caught him.
41,1,**About a month ago**
41,2,**see**
41,3,**we were going to a church league softball game**
41,4,**They'd had the games all scheduled for the diamond at Homestead High School**
41,5,**You know where that's at?**
41,6,**Well**
41,7,**we're going up Twenty-four**
41,8,"**and getting ready to turn there, at Ranch Eggs**"
41,9,**and I was slowing down**
41,10,**got my turn signal on**
41,11,**and as I was slowing down**
41,12,**there's this guy sitting over here to the right**
41,13,**coming on to Twenty-four**
41,14,**Looked like he's about in his middle fifties**
41,15,**And he starts creeping out onto Twenty-four**
41,16,**and he's blocking off the lane**
41,17,**and he's heading for the same spot that I'm going**
41,18,**You know how you sit there and wait for the traffic to get by**
41,19,**Right there in the median?**
41,20,**This guy starts**
41,21,**pulls out in the lane**
41,22,**I thought you jerk**
41,23,**but I hurried up**
41,24,**and got in there ahead of him**
41,25,**And he sits there**
41,26,**and waits on**
41,27,**Mean he's got Twenty-four blocked**
41,28,**He's sitting there**
41,29,**right in the middle of the highway**
41,30,**Got it blocked**
41,31,**So we went on across**
41,32,**as soon as traffic cleared**
41,33,**and we're headed up there towards that diamond**
41,34,"**and it's about maybe mile, two miles north of Twenty-four on Aboite Center**"
41,35,**and this guy's following us**
41,36,"**see, as we're going up there this hill there**"
41,37,**At Ranch Eggs**
41,38,**We're going up this hill**
41,39,**and this guy's right on my tail**
41,40,**And Lisa was with me**
41,41,**and she said**
41,42,**That guy is right on your tail**
41,43,**I looked in the mirror**
41,44,**and sure enough**
41,45,**he's right up there**
41,46,**practically bumper to bumper**
41,47,**and I'm trying to keep an eye on him**
41,48,**make sure he doesn't slam into me or anything**
41,49,**He starts weaving back and forth**
41,50,**couldn't keep it in one lane**
41,51,**Really bad news**
41,52,**And all the time this is going on**
41,53,**I'm thinking how drunk driving is the number one killer of kids**
41,54,**and all this business**
41,55,**How it everybodys responsibility**
41,56,**So I was trying to make up my mind what to do**
41,57,**I was pretty sure he was drunk**
41,58,**at least he appeared that way**
41,59,**so I figured that when we get up to this stop sign**
41,60,**I'm going to go back and find out what his problem is**
41,61,**cause**
41,62,**I'm thinking he's drunk**
41,63,**and I know I oughta do something about it**
41,64,**but at the same time**
41,65,"**if he's sick, like maybe he's having a heart attack or something**"
41,66,**you know**
41,67,**You gotta do something**
41,68,**I'd really feel bad if I read the papers the next day**
41,69,**that the guy**
41,70,**some guy**
41,71,**died with a heart attack**
41,72,**and there I was thinking he was drunk**
41,73,**And I didn't really want to get involved**
41,74,**to be honest with you**
41,75,**But I had made up my mind**
41,76,**that I was going to**
41,77,**so we pulled up to the stop**
41,78,**at this sign**
41,79,**and right across the road**
41,80,**stopped a sheriff's car**
41,81,**So I motion for him to come over**
41,82,**and they whip across the road**
41,83,**and I got out the car**
41,84,**walked over there**
41,85,**and said to this deputy**
41,86,**This guy behind me is either sick or he's drunk**
41,87,**but he's got a problem**
41,88,**He can't keep his car on one side of the road**
41,89,**And I said**
41,90,**He's got a definite problem**
41,91,**So they started down there**
41,92,**And as soon as he sees me get out of the car**
41,93,**and walk over there to the police car**
41,94,**the guy stops**
41,95,**way far away from the intersection**
41,96,**He stops**
41,97,**and he throws his car into reverse**
41,98,**and starts backing up**
41,99,**When the cops went down there to check him out**
41,100,**he starts backing up**
41,101,**going backwards down that road**
41,102,**Pretty soon they catch up with him**
41,103,**and he starts forward again**
41,104,**and they make a U-turn in the road**
41,105,**and start following him**
41,106,**and he's just driving real slow**
41,107,**and careful**
41,108,**Haha**
41,109,**it's pretty funny**
41,110,**I don't know if they ever stopped him or not**
43,1,Some people went to see a league softball game.
43,2,A guy in his 50s came
43,3,"and blocked, I presume, some traffic."
43,4,It was linked to ranch eggs.
43,5,"Then the guy was near them,"
43,6,bumper to bumper.
43,7,A driver thought he was drunk
43,8,and was worried he may get a heart attack.
43,9,A police car is then seen.
44,1,"About a month ago we were driving up to the Junior baseball game, up Twenty-Four,"
44,2,there is this guy trying to turn left onto the road.
44,3,So we wait for him to turn
44,4,but he gets about half way across before the lights change
44,5,"and he's stuck in the middle of the road,"
44,6,right on the median.
44,7,Anyways we drive through quickly to get ahead of him
44,8,and when the traffic starts again he begins to follow us real close up Twenty-Four.
44,9,Lisa was in the car with me
44,10,"and she says ""that guy is following real close"","
44,11,and I look back in the rear-view mirror
44,12,and she's right.
44,13,He's weaving this way and that across the lanes
44,14,and sticking real close to us all the way up Twenty-Four.
44,15,"We go a mile, maybe two"
44,16,and I'm starting to think about drunk drivers
44,17,"and how they're the biggest cause of death to kids and whatnot,"
44,18,because I'm thinking this guy must be drunk to be driving like this.
44,19,I think I'll stop at the next light
44,20,and get out
44,21,and go back there
44,22,"and see what's up,"
44,23,"give him a piece of my mind,"
44,24,but then I wonder if he's actually sick
44,25,and if I want a confrontation after all.
44,26,I'd hate it to read the paper the next day
44,27,and hear about a guy dying of a heart attack on the highway
44,28,and I had done nothing about it.
44,29,"Anyway, my mind was made up"
44,30,and I was going to go back there
44,31,when we pull up at a stop sign
44,32,"and there's a police car on the other side of the road,"
44,33,so I call them over.
44,34,They swing across the road
44,35,and I get out
44,36,"and say ""that guy back there is either drunk or sick, but he can't keep his car in his lane at all""."
44,37,They turn the cruiser around
44,38,"and head over to him,"
44,39,and he has stopped a ways up the road.
44,40,"He starts to back up slowly when he sees the police coming towards him,"
44,41,then he starts forward again
44,42,and drives real slow like back along the road.
44,43,I don't know whether they ever caught him
44,44,or what was what haha
44,45,but it sure was a strange thing.
45,1,"A driver and her companion, Lisa, were going to a baseball game a month or so ago."
45,2,They were driving along HWY 24.
45,3,"As they drove, another car began tailgating them."
45,4,"This car was weaving and at one point it stopped in the middle of the road, blocking all the cars that were behind it."
45,5,The original driver thought she had gotten away from the tailgater but he reappeared.
45,6,"She feared he was either drunk or having a heart attack and stopped her car, concerned."
45,7,A police (sheriff) car was across the road.
45,8,She approached asking for the sheriff's help.
45,9,"He, in turn, went after the other car which backed away."
45,10,The sheriff did a U turn and the other car began driving forward in a careful manner.
45,11,"The original driver was amused seeing how well the tailgater was now driving, as he was being followed by the sheriff."
45,12,She did not find out what transpired afterwards.
46,1,Someone was driving
46,2,trying to merge onto the highway
46,3,when a driver pulled out
46,4,and blocked him
46,5,"and then started driving erratically,"
46,6,following too close
46,7,and appearing to be either drunk or sick.
46,8,"The storyteller stopped,"
46,9,and told a sheriff what was happening
46,10,and the bad driver
46,11,went in reverse
46,12,and drove away slowly
47,1,Some people were driving
47,2,and saw a potentially drunk driver
47,3,cut in to traffic
47,4,and drive erratically.
48,1,About a month ago a guy came through
48,2,and we passed coming on to twenty-four
48,3,looked about turning to fifty
48,4,and he knew he was heading where I wanted to park.
48,5,So he is sitting there right there in the middle of the road
48,6,so he went on across as soon as traffic cleared
48,7,and we headed up two miles
48,8,and the guy followed us.
48,9,The guy is on my tail
48,10,bumper to bumper
48,11,I'm watching him to make sure he doesn't back on me
48,12,and he is stuck really bad.
48,13,All of the time this is happening
48,14,I was trying to make up my mind
48,15,and I was going to go back
48,16,and figure his mind because he seemed drunk.
48,17,"I really felt bad reading that the guy had to die with a heart attack,"
48,18,I walked out of the car
48,19,and reported that this guy was drunk
48,20,and he couldn't keep his car.
48,21,"The cops went there to check him out,"
48,22,they checked out on him
48,23,he was just driving pretty slow
48,24,and that was bad news.
50,1,"While driving to a church league softball game,"
50,2,the narrator encountered a driver
50,3,who appeared to be intoxicated.
50,4,After observing the driver
50,5,blocking traffic
50,6,"and weaving dangerously close behind them,"
50,7,they decided to alert law enforcement.
50,8,"Upon reaching a stop sign,"
50,9,they saw a sheriff's car
50,10,and informed the deputy about the erratic driver.
50,11,"As the police approached,"
50,12,the suspect noticed
50,13,"and began to back away from the intersection,"
50,14,leading to a slow chase
50,15,as the officers followed him.
50,16,The situation highlighted concerns about drunk driving
50,17,and the narrator's internal conflict
50,18,about intervening for safety reasons.
51,1,"They were heading to an event for the diamond at Homestead High School,"
51,2,going on twenty-four.
51,3,"They spot a strange man on the road,"
51,4,creeping around and acting strange.
51,5,"They then realised that this man was following them,"
51,6,and was almost touching their bumper just a mile or two away from Ranch Eggs.
51,7,They spot a nearby sherif
51,8,"and tell them about this guy,"
51,9,how he has a problem
51,10,and could be drunk.
51,11,The guy sees them approach the sherif
51,12,"and backs up,"
51,13,reversing the car away
51,14,and driving off.
51,15,The sherif hops into their car
51,16,and starts to chase after them.
51,17,"After the guy did previously speed away,"
51,18,they start to act normal
51,19,and drive normally.
51,20,They never found out if they pulled him over or not.
52,1,Someone was driving with someone named Lisa down the highway.
52,2,(Twenty-four?)
52,3,[They were] going to a baseball game.
52,4,They had a driver blocking the highway.
52,5,[They] wait to turn.
52,6,They go first.
52,7,The driver is behind them.
52,8,[The driver is] swerving back and forth.
52,9,The speaker thinks the guy is either drunk or having a heart attack.
52,10,So they go slow.
52,11,[They] see a cop.
52,12,They call the cop over.
52,13,[They] tell them the vehicle behind them may be drunk.
52,14,The cops go off towards the car.
52,15,The car reverses down the road.
52,16,[The car] then does a U-turn.
52,17,[The car] drives slow and careful.
54,1,A man was with a woman named Lisa.
54,2,He was driving on highway 24.
54,3,[He was driving] on the way to a church softball league game.
54,4,[The game was] at Homestead High School.
54,5,"On the way there, near Ranch Eggs,"
54,6,the man encountered what appeared to be a drunk driver or a man that was having a heart attack.
54,7,The alleged drunk driver pulled out into the middle of the highway median.
54,8,"After the man going to the softball game passed the drunk driver,"
54,9,the drunk driver appeared to be following him down the highway.
54,10,[the drunk driver appeared to be] swerving in the lanes.
54,11,"Eventually, the man found a sheriff."
54,12,[The man] told them what was going on.
54,13,"However, from far back, the drunk driver saw the police."
54,14,[The drunk driver] tried to reverse from them.
54,15,"Then, the police made a u-turn."
54,16,[Then] the drunk driver started going forward.
54,17,The main character from the story wasn't sure what ended up happening to the drunk driver after that.
55,1,"I was going to the church leaders' football game,"
55,2,and a man in his mid-thirties is blocking the lines.
55,3,It's tail to tail and bumper to bumper.
55,4,"I think he is drunk,"
55,5,but he might be having a heart attack.
55,6,"I don't want to accuse him of being drunk,"
55,7,and then finding out when reading the news that he was having a heart attack.
55,8,"When reaching the stop sign,"
55,9,I saw a sheriff
55,10,"and called him over,"
55,11,"and told him that this man is either drunk or having a heart attack,"
55,12,and that he is swerving in both lanes.
55,13,The sheriff follows him.
56,1,There was a game
56,2,we were heading to
56,3,at a school Homestead High.
56,4,A vehicle cut in front of us
56,5,on the highway
56,6,"he was driving recklessly,"
56,7,heading the same way
56,8,we went.
56,9,I thought to myself
56,10,I have to do something
56,11,about the way this guy was driving.
56,12,There were many reports
56,13,of kids dying
56,14,because of drunk drivers.
56,15,Turns out
56,16,he was having a heart attack
56,17,and not driving drunk.
57,1,"The couple, man and wife Lisa are heading to a softball game at the diamond."
57,2,"Whilst driving near the church,"
57,3,"a man is driving erratically,"
57,4,blocking the highway.
57,5,"They overtake him,"
57,6,"but he starts to tailgate them,"
57,7,weaving in and out of lanes.
57,8,They think he might be drunk
57,9,but are not 100% sure.
57,10,"They flag a police patrol car,"
57,11,"when the driver of the erratic car notices,"
57,12,he reverses
57,13,and takes a minor road to try to escape.
57,14,"The police car heads in pursuit,"
57,15,but the behaviour of the car changes
57,16,and it stops driving erratically.
58,1,"About a month ago,"
58,2,"Well, we are going twenty-four,"
58,3,"Coming on to twenty-four,"
58,4,"and he's lending for the same place,"
58,5,"I am hurried,"
58,6,"got in the waits,"
58,7,"got it blocked,"
58,8,"there maybe a mile or two,"
58,9,"at ranch eggs,"
58,10,"and Lisa was with me,"
58,11,"and I'm trying to keep,"
58,12,"couldn't keep in lane,"
58,13,"how it's everybody's responsibility,"
58,14,"so I figured it out,"
58,15,"you gotta do something,"
58,16,he's gotta go.
59,1,"Going to some baseball games at Homestead High school,"
59,2,going on the 24th.
59,3,There's a guy waiting to pull out who wants to edge out.
59,4,I sneak ahead of him at the intersection
59,5,and head on up the hill.
59,6,He pulls into the lane behind me
59,7,and then is riding my tail.
59,8,"Lisa, who is in the car with me, says, ""he's right on your tail."""
59,9,I think he might be drunk.
59,10,"He then starts weaving,"
59,11,and I'm not sure what's going on.
59,12,I decided I'm going to stop
59,13,and check it out at the next stop sign.
59,14,"We stop,"
59,15,there's a sheriff
59,16,and I motion him over.
59,17,"[I] Say, ""this guy is drunk or sick."""
59,18,"The guy starts backing up,"
59,19,turns around
59,20,and drives off slowly.
59,21,The cops follow.
60,1,Headed to a church league baseball game.
60,2,Started driving and going up the twenty four
60,3,But there's a guy that that can't stay in his lane.
60,4,Kept weaving in and out.
60,5,With a friend named Lisa.
60,6,"Soon enough they're tailgating the speaker, almost bumper to bumper."
60,7,They recall the number one cause of death in kids is drunk driving.
60,8,The speaker is pretty sure he's drunk.
60,9,Or otherwise very sick since he can't stay on one side of the road.
60,10,They get off the twenty four
60,11,"And think that something should be done about that car,"
60,12,Since they would feel horrible if the other driver wasn't drunk but instead was having a heart attack or were ill
60,13,And found out about them in the news the next day.
60,14,Found a sheriff's car
60,15,And told them about the encounter.
60,16,The suspected drunk driver saw them get off and speak with the people in the sheriff's car
60,17,And stopped far away.
60,18,Then reversed
60,19,And started to go backwards.
60,20,They then started to go very slowly.
60,21,Never found out if the sheriff's car caught up with them
60,22,And never heard about it again.
61,1,IT'S ABOUT A GUY
61,2,WHO WAS BEING FOLLOWED BUMPER TO BUMPER
61,3,BY ANOTHER CAR.
61,4,HE INITIALLY THOUGHT
61,5,THE GUY WAS EITHER SICK OR DRUNK
61,6,CAUSE HE COULDN'T STAY IN HIS LANE.
61,7,SO HE STOPPED
61,8,BY A SHERIFF.
61,9,WHERE HE EXPLAINED WHAT WAS GOING ON
61,10,BUT WHEN THE POLICE STARTED GOING AFTER HIM
61,11,HE STARTED DRIVING IN REVERSE.
62,1,You jerk
62,2,Ranch eggs
62,3,Got twenty four blocked
63,1,The story is about a suspected drunk driving incident
63,2,where the initial interaction with the alleged drunk driver estimated to be in his mid-fifties
63,3,pulls out and blocks the road on the highway.
63,4,"After realizing the drunk driver blocked the road,"
63,5,"the storyteller then indicates they and their passenger, Lisa,"
63,6,waited for it to clear a bit
63,7,before getting out of there from the situation with the drunk driver.
63,8,"As they were going along their way,"
63,9,"Lisa indicates that the drunk driver is following them,"
63,10,to which the storyteller confirms.
63,11,The suspected drunk driver started driving erratically.
63,12,This was where the storyteller started suspecting the drunk driver to be drunk
63,13,and made a comment about drunk driving needs to be the responsibility of all of us.
63,14,The storyteller then starts to question if the person is truly a drunk driver
63,15,and not someone who is in medical duress.
63,16,The storyteller then chooses to intervene
63,17,"to ensure that if the other driver was indeed in medical duress,"
63,18,they did not deny them help through hasty judgement.
63,19,The storyteller pulls up to the stop sign
63,20,"where there was a sheriff signaled the sheriff car over,"
63,21,got out of their car
63,22,and made their way to the sheriff car
63,23,to tell them what has been happening with the erratic driving behind them.
63,24,"As soon as the suspected drunk driver saw this,"
63,25,he stops far away from them
63,26,and starts reversing away from the cops.
63,27,The cops went for him
63,28,and soon caught up with him.
63,29,The drunk driver then threw his car into drive
63,30,"and started going very slow,"
63,31,causing the cops to make a U-turn
63,32,and go after him.
63,33,The storyteller says it was comical
63,34,and does not know if the cops ever stopped the suspected drunk driver.
64,1,A group was on a route to a church league softball game
64,2,about a month ago at Homestead High School.
64,3,"Driving down a highway called Twenty-four,"
64,4,they noticed a man in his fifties blocking the lane
64,5,as he attempted to turn.
64,6,"After passing him,"
64,7,"they noticed he was following them too closely,"
64,8,swerving back and forth.
64,9,They became concerned that he might be drunk.
64,10,"Getting nervous,"
64,11,they decided to call a passing sheriff's car
64,12,as they approached a stop sign.
64,13,"They told him what was going on,"
64,14,"showing further back down the road,"
64,15,where the man was driving recklessly.
64,16,"In an instant,"
64,17,the man spotted the deputies
64,18,"and backed down the road,"
64,19,making it a silly scene.
64,20,The deputies chased after him
64,21,but weren't quite sure if they had any cause
64,22,to actually arrest him
64,23,or find out what the problem was.
65,1,Uhh.
65,2,Some guy is going to a baseball game or something.
65,3,He's at an intersection.
65,4,Another car is being weird.
65,5,The other car is riding his bumper.
65,6,He's got a woman named Lisa with him.
65,7,He thinks the other guy is drunk or sick or something.
65,8,He stops.
65,9,[He] tells a cop about it.
65,10,Then the guy pulls off.
65,11,The cop starts chasing him.
66,1,"About a month ago, we were heading to a church league softball game."
66,2,The games were all set to be played at the diamond at Homestead High School.
66,3,Do you know where that is?
66,4,"Well, we were driving up Route 24, getting ready to turn near Ranch Eggs,"
66,5,"and I was slowing down,"
66,6,signaling to turn.
66,7,"As I was slowing down,"
66,8,"there was this guy sitting off to the right,"
66,9,getting ready to merge onto Route 24.
66,10,He looked like he was in his mid-fifties.
66,11,"He starts inching out onto the road,"
66,12,"partially blocking the lane,"
66,13,aiming for the same spot I was headed to.
66,14,You know how you wait in the median for traffic to pass?
66,15,"This guy pulls into the lane,"
66,16,"and I thought, ""What a jerk..."""
66,17,but I sped up and got in front of him.
66,18,"He stayed put,"
66,19,"blocking Route 24,"
66,20,right in the middle of the road.
66,21,"Once the traffic cleared,"
66,22,we crossed over
66,23,"and continued toward the diamond,"
66,24,which is about a mile or two north of Route 24 on Aboite Center Road.
66,25,But this guy starts following us.
66,26,"As we were heading up the slight hill by Ranch Eggs,"
66,27,he was tailing us closely.
66,28,"Lisa was with me,"
66,29,"and she said, ""That guy is right on your bumper!"""
66,30,"I checked the rearview mirror,"
66,31,"and sure enough, he was almost touching my car,"
66,32,so I kept an eye on him to make sure he didn’t hit us.
66,33,"He started swerving,"
66,34,unable to stay in one lane.
66,35,It was pretty alarming.
66,36,"The whole time this was happening,"
66,37,I kept thinking about how drunk driving is the leading cause of deaths for kids
66,38,and how everyone has a responsibility to do something.
66,39,I was pretty sure the guy was drunk—or at least acting like it—
66,40,"so I decided that when we got to the stop sign,"
66,41,I was going to see what was going on.
66,42,"Maybe he was drunk,"
66,43,"but then again,"
66,44,"what if he was sick, like having a heart attack or something?"
66,45,"I knew I had to act,"
66,46,but I didn’t want to get involved if I didn’t have to.
66,47,"Still, I made up my mind."
66,48,"When we pulled up to the stop sign,"
66,49,there happened to be a sheriff’s car parked across the road.
66,50,"I motioned for the officer to come over,"
66,51,and they quickly drove across.
66,52,"I got out of my car,"
66,53,"walked over to the deputy,"
66,54,"and said, ""The guy behind me is either sick or drunk, but he’s got a problem."
66,55,"He can't stay in his lane."""
66,56,"I told him, ""Something’s definitely wrong."""
66,57,So they headed toward the guy.
66,58,"As soon as he saw me get out and walk to the police car,"
66,59,"he stopped way back from the intersection,"
66,60,"put his car in reverse,"
66,61,and started backing up.
66,62,"When the cops went to check on him,"
66,63,he kept backing down the road.
66,64,"Eventually, they caught up,"
66,65,and he started driving forward again.
66,66,"The officers made a U-turn to follow him,"
66,67,and now he was driving real slow and carefully.
66,68,"Ha ha, it was kind of funny..."
66,69,I don’t know if they ever caught him.
67,1,The story is about an observant driver
67,2,who noticed another driver's erratic driving
67,3,while he was going for a league game.
67,4,The observant driver notified the police-
67,5,"a sheriff's car,"
67,6,even though he was uncertain what could have caused the abnormal driving.
67,7,The observant driver was not sure
67,8,"if it could be due to drunk-driving,"
67,9,or the erratic driver could be suffering from a heart attack.
67,10,"As the vehicle slowed down,"
67,11,"and cops walked up to investigate what the problem was,"
67,12,the erratic driver suddenly put the vehicle in reverse
67,13,"and started moving down the road,"
67,14,and also started moving forward
67,15,but this time in a slow manner
67,16,while he was being followed by police vehicles.
68,1,"A young person was trying to get onto Twenty-four off the highway,"
68,2,when a car was blocking the way.
68,3,"Instead they decided to go another way to get to their destination,"
68,4,and all of a sudden the car that was blocking the road started to follow them.
68,5,"The car was constantly up their tail,"
68,6,"bumper to bumper,"
68,7,borderline crashing into them.
68,8,"The person thought to themself,"
68,9,maybe he's drunk or having a heart attack.
68,10,"Suddenly, he sees a police car on the side of the road,"
68,11,and he stops
68,12,and signals the police to come over.
68,13,"He states that the man who was following him was driving back and forth,"
68,14,and can't keep in the same lane.
68,15,He states that he must have been drunk or sick.
68,16,The car that was following them starts to slowly reverse back
68,17,when they notice the police.
68,18,"The police begin to follow the retracting car,"
68,19,and the narrator doesn't know if they ever caught up to them.
69,1,A couple was going to a baseball game
69,2,and on their way
69,3,there was a car on highway 24
69,4,that was blocking the road by the median.
69,5,The couple passed the car
69,6,and the car followed them
69,7,and tailgated them
69,8,while swerving.
69,9,"The driver told his partner, Lisa,"
69,10,that he was going to stop at the stop sign up ahead
69,11,and he was going to go back
69,12,and approach the driver
69,13,to see if he was either drunk
69,14,or if he was sick
69,15,(having a medical emergency).
69,16,When the couple approached the stop sign
69,17,they noticed a police officer
69,18,and got out of their car
69,19,to inform him of what had happened.
69,20,The car behind them noticed this
69,21,and stopped down the road.
69,22,The police officer went down
69,23,to speak to the driver
69,24,"but the driver started to reverse the car,"
69,25,until the police officer was able to catch up.
69,26,Once the officer caught up
69,27,"the driver started driving forward again,"
69,28,really slow
69,29,and really carefully
69,30,in a very comical way.
70,1,"A month ago, this guy was heading to his church's softball."
70,2,"As he drives, a man in his fifties seems to be following him."
70,3,This old man follows him bumper to bumper.
70,4,The two women in the car agree.
70,5,"As the guy is driving, the old man drives from lane to lane."
70,6,The old man seems to be drunk.
70,7,The driver is concerned.
70,8,The driver is worried that the old man is maybe having a heart attack or something.
70,9,The driver was hesitant.
70,10,The driver decided to stop.
70,11,The driver talked to a sheriff.
70,12,The sheriff followed the old man.
70,13,The old man made a U turn.
70,14,The old man ended up following the road's rules.
71,1,About a month ago we were going to a church league softball game.
71,2,They'd had the games all scheduled for the diamond at Homestead High School.
71,3,You know where that's at?
71,4,"Well, we're going up Twenty-four,"
71,5,"and getting ready to turn there,"
71,6,at Ranch Eggs.
71,7,You know how you sit there and wait for the traffic to get by?
71,8,Right there in the median?
71,9,"This guy starts,"
71,10,"pulls out in the lane,"
71,11,"i thought ""you jerk"""
71,12,but i hurried up and got in there ahead of him.
71,13,Couldn't keep it one lane.
71,14,I figured that when we get up to this stop sign
71,15,I'm going to go back
71,16,"and find out what his problem is,"
71,17,'cause i'm thinking he's drunk
71,18,and i know i oughta do something about it
71,19,"but at the same time if he's sick,"
71,20,like maybe he's having a heart attack or something
71,21,you know.
71,22,you gotta do something.
71,23,"Pretty soon they catch up with him,"
71,24,"and he starts forward again,"
71,25,and they make a U-turn in the road to follow him
71,26,but he's just slowly driving and being careful.
71,27,I don't know if they ever stopped him or not.
72,1,"about a month ago we were going to see a church softball game,"
72,2,"the games were near twenty-four,"
72,3,"as we were on the way there was a guy who was in his middle fifties,"
72,4,he was blocking the highway.
72,5,"on the way there was a driver who was driving really close to me,"
72,6,"basically bumper to bumper,"
72,7,he appeared to be drunk
72,8,"so I told a police officer about him,"
72,9,that he was either unwell or drunk
73,1,Some guy was going somewhere.
73,2,Homestead and he was driving
73,3,and there was a guy in the median
73,4,but he thought the guy was drunk
73,5,but what if he wasn't drunk
73,6,and had a heart attack
73,7,and the guy didn't want to hear on the news
73,8,that he thought drunk guy was actually heart attack guy
73,9,so he went back to check
73,10,and lots of other words...omg
74,1,The story is about a guy and someone named Lisa.
74,2,"They were driving around,"
74,3,and I think they spotted a dangerous driver on the highway
74,4,that they were driving on.
74,5,He was driving
74,6,the erratic probably drunk driver all over the road
74,7,and in the median of the highway.
74,8,"He talked about, with some concern,"
74,9,that the driver was driving all the road dangerously
74,10,and that is perhaps the number one killer of children.
74,11,Lisa was able to see the driver as well in the car.
74,12,Also I think that the police were involved
74,13,and pulled over the driver.
74,14,He may have talked also to the guy
74,15,describing his personal driving story.
74,16,The person describing the story in the end
74,17,seemed that he thought the incident
74,18,"that he viewed passing old high school,"
74,19,and on to the highway viewing the dangerous driver
74,20,he though was a bit funny and concerning.
74,21,This is what I can recall.
75,1,There was going to be a church softball game
75,2,"that a lady and her friend were going to,"
75,3,at the intersection a man started chasing them
75,4,swirling all over the road
75,5,and he couldn't keep the car straight.
75,6,"While all this is happening,"
75,7,our lady driver (I can't recall her name) starts to think to herself
75,8,"that this man must be drunk or sick,"
75,9,and she thinks about how drunk driving is the number one cause of deaths on the road.
75,10,She also thinks to herself
75,11,that if the man is having a heart attack
75,12,then she will feel bad for calling him a drunk.
75,13,"Deciding to take action and find out what the man's problem is,"
75,14,she spotted the sheriff's car
75,15,and decided to get them involved.
75,16,The man had something to hide
75,17,because he made a ridiculous attempt to get away from the police.
75,18,We do not know if he was caught or not in the end.
76,1,They were heading to a baseball game
76,2,in a car
76,3,when some guy pulled out on them on the Twenty Four.
76,4,He appeared to be driving erratically
76,5,which made them (the narrator and Lisa) think that the driver was either sick or drunk.
76,6,"Concerned about the safety of others, particularly children,"
76,7,they stopped at an intersection
76,8,and beckoned over a sheriff to check on the driver.
76,9,"When the sheriff approached the vehicle,"
76,10,"the drive first began to reverse away,"
76,11,"and when caught,"
76,12,began to drive forward to evade the sheriffs.
77,1,On a sunny day
77,2,the church baseball league went up
77,3,the 24th at Meadowview.
78,1,A lady was walking down the road
78,2,and saw a guy following her
78,3,[she] was not sure if he was drunk or sick
78,4,and she made up her mind to approach him
78,5,to ask what his problem was
78,6,"and just as she was about to do that,"
78,7,a sheriff's car stopped the guy
78,8,and she told the sheriff to check on the guy
78,9,if he's sick or drunk
78,10,and she was scared
78,11,in case he's sick
78,12,and having a heart attack
78,13,and dies
78,14,"if she can hear this the following day about it,"
78,15,then she would really feel bad
78,16,knowing she could have done something about [it].
79,1,"Driving in the car up to play softball up twenty four,"
79,2,"sat waiting at a junction,"
79,3,"this man in another car isn’t moving,"
79,4,"then he basically blocks all of the intersection with his car,"
79,5,so I managed to get in front of him.
79,6,"Driving up twenty four,"
79,7,I can see him in the mirror swerving from side to side
79,8,not being able to stay in the right lane.
79,9,I keep looking back
79,10,thinking that drunk drivers are the number one killers.
79,11,Then I start to question if he’s drunk or poorly?
79,12,Maybe sick?
79,13,"While driving and keeping an eye on the guy in the back,"
79,14,how am I going to stop him.
79,15,When I get to the next Stop sign
79,16,I’m going to get out and see if he’s okay.
79,17,When I reach the stop sign
79,18,I see a police car
79,19,I ask them over and tell them about he guy behind
79,20,"and don’t know if he’s drunk driver or sick,"
79,21,the cop walks to his car
79,22,and he puts it in reverse back down the hill.
79,23,the cops are after him
79,24,"I’m not sure if they caught him,"
79,25,I carried on my journey
80,1,Four people decided to attend a softball game
80,2,This writer comes across a drunk man
80,3,This lady could sense something was off about him
80,4,Whilst she was driving
80,5,She came across a sheriff car
80,6,She informed them that the man was either very sick or very drunk
80,7,The lady then recalled
80,8,How much drink driving impacts drivers and victims
81,1,They were going to a softball game
81,2,and they were going onto a highway
81,3,and the guy started driving erratically in front of them.
81,4,He came to a stop at one point
81,5,and blocked the highway
81,6,(I think it was 24)
81,7,and meant that they couldn’t get around him.
81,8,He continued driving erratically
81,9,and he was worried about the car crashing into him
81,10,and causing an accident.
81,11,He was initially convinced that he was drunk
81,12,but then wondered if he was ill
81,13,and felt guilty.
81,14,He flagged down a nearby sheriff’s car
81,15,and explained the situation.
81,16,They started following him
81,17,and he initially stopped a way away.
81,18,He then went into reverse
81,19,and they had to do a U turn
81,20,before he continued driving slowly
81,21,and carefully.
82,1,my laptop froze
83,1,We were going to a church league soft ball game
83,2,scheduled at Homestead High School.
83,3,You know where that is?
83,4,"We are going to Twenty Four,"
83,5,and also going at Ranch eggs getting ready.
83,6,There is this guy seated on the right.
83,7,"On the median, the guy starts."
83,8,So we went across
83,9,as soon as traffic cleared
83,10,we headed towards diamond.
83,11,The guy kept following us.
83,12,I was with Lisa
83,13,"and she said ""that guy is on your tail."""
83,14,I looked in the mirror.
83,15,The guy seemed like he was drunk
83,16,but he was having a heart attack.
84,1,He was on his way to Homestead
84,2,to play ball
84,3,He went up Highway 24
84,4,Another car was merging on to the highway
84,5,and slowed down
84,6,He managed to get ahead of the car
84,7,but the car stayed in the middle of the highway
84,8,slowing down the traffic
84,9,Then the slowed car sped up
84,10,and he was on its tail
84,11,His passenger was named Lisa
84,12,and mentioned that the car was on his tail
84,13,He continued on Highway 24
84,14,towards the field
85,1,A lady who went for a game
85,2,observed that she's being followed
85,3,by a man
85,4,who she assumed is either sick or drunk.
85,5,With her ongoing thought about causes of road accident
85,6,and negative happenings on the road
85,7,she was worried
85,8,and concerned about the man's driving attitude.
85,9,She explained to the local sheriff about this happening
85,10,when she got her chance
85,11,then the man/driver desist
85,12,and take off
85,13,leading to a chase.
86,1,Somebody was driving to a church league softball game
86,2,where they had to turn onto the 24
86,3,They went to pull out
86,4,but another car did at the same time
86,5,He beat them to the spot in traffic
86,6,and the other car was blocking the road
86,7,He then carries on driving
86,8,"and the car follows him, very close"
86,9,Then he decides to stop
86,10,and see what his deal was
86,11,in case he was drunk or sick
86,12,He beckons a sheriff over at the stop sign
86,13,and the car reverse down the road
86,14,before going forward
86,15,when the sheriff caught them
86,16,We don't know if they got pulled over.
87,1,A guy and his friend Lisa are going to a softball game at the diamond.
87,2,"Whilst driving there, a gentleman from the side road tries to jump in by pulling out."
87,3,But their car goes ahead filling the gap.
87,4,Meaning the other guy's car is blocking opposing traffic on the 29th street.
87,5,This guy then proceeds to follow their car very closely.
87,6,And is bumper to bumper with them.
87,7,They notice he is also swerving between lanes.
87,8,They consider the idea he is possibly drunk.
87,9,The driver thinks of the amount of teenagers that die due to drink driving.
87,10,And also considers the driver may be having a medical issue.
87,11,They decide at the next stop sign they will stop and see what the guy's issue is.
87,12,As he would feel bad if tomorrow he found out the guy passed due a medical issue.
87,13,And they could have checked and helped.
87,14,They find a sheriff's car parked opposite the road when they stop.
87,15,And so they approach the sheriff.
87,16,And inform them of the driver's driving.
87,17,And that they believe he may be having a medical issue or may be drunk.
87,18,The second driver (the one who may be drunk) hasn't reached the same point as their car.
87,19,But sees them talking to the police.
87,20,And starts to reverse back down the road.
87,21,The police car follows down.
87,22,And follows the car which has now slowed down.
87,23,And is driving at a suitable speed and in a sensible manner.
88,1,"A man is driving down 24,"
88,2,"headed to a ball game,"
88,3,past an egg place.
88,4,He has a passenger named Lisa with him.
88,5,A driver in another vehicle is blocking traffic.
88,6,The first vehicle passes him.
88,7,"Then, the second driver approaches from behind at a fast pace."
88,8,He is swerving back and forth.
88,9,The first driver decides he is going to stop at a stop sign
88,10,and approach the other driver to find out what his problem is.
88,11,He suspects either drunk driving or a medical problem.
88,12,"Just then, a sheriff stops across the road."
88,13,The driver in the first vehicle approaches the sheriff
88,14,and explains the situation.
88,15,"The sheriff then starts following the vehicle,"
88,16,which initially was going in reverse.
88,17,The vehicle then started going forward
88,18,and the sheriff made a U-turn
88,19,and continued pursuing the vehicle.
88,20,The man lost track of the pursuit after that.
89,1,About a month ago we were going to a church softball game.
89,2,There's a driver blocking the intersection.
89,3,"This whole time I'm thinking,"
89,4,drunk driving is the number one killer of children.
89,5,I saw the sheriff and told a deputy that the guy behind me is either sick or drunk but he has a problem.
89,6,He can't keep his car in the lane.
89,7,The deputy starts driving towards the man
89,8,and the driver starts driving backwards down the hill.
89,9,"When the deputy gets near him, the driver starts going forward slowly."
89,10,"HAHA, it's pretty comical."
89,11,I don't know if they ever stopped him or not.
90,1,We were driving
90,2,to a little league baseball game
90,3,at Homestead High
90,4,on the 24 highway.
90,5,I was expecting
90,6,to turn at Ranch Eggs.
90,7,I pulled to the median
90,8,to wait for my turn
90,9,and just then
90,10,another guy in a car
90,11,wanted to turn as well.
90,12,There was no room for him
90,13,on the median
90,14,so I took my chance
90,15,and made the turn
90,16,ahead of him
90,17,onto Aboite Road.
90,18,"For some reason,"
90,19,he followed me
90,20,"too closely,"
90,21,weaving behind me
90,22,and staying close
90,23,on my tail.
90,24,Even my wife Lisa
90,25,commented on this.
90,26,There was obviously something wrong
90,27,with him.
90,28,"Maybe he was ill,"
90,29,or drunk
90,30,and he could be a danger
90,31,to other people.
90,32,I made up my mind
90,33,to stop at the next Stop intersection
90,34,coming up
90,35,and get out of the car
90,36,to try and discuss this
90,37,with him.
90,38,"When I stopped,"
90,39,I noticed a police car
90,40,"on the other side of the road,"
90,41,and I motioned to them
90,42,and expressed my concern.
90,43,"When the other driver saw the police,"
90,44,he started to back down
90,45,the highway.
90,46,"The police followed him,"
90,47,saw him reverse again
90,48,and progress very slowly ahead again.
90,49,They followed him again
90,50,and they all eventually disappeared.
90,51,I never found out
90,52,whether they caught up with him.
91,1,I was driving down the highway to Homestead.
91,2,"As I was driving down the highway,"
91,3,I was about to turn right onto Twenty Four.
91,4,"When across from me, I saw a car with a man in his middle fifties."
91,5,He was blocking the highway.
91,6,Eventually he moved
91,7,and I was able to turn right onto Twenty Four.
91,8,"Lisa was in the car with me, in the backseat,"
91,9,"and she said ""He's tailing you!"""
91,10,"So I looked back,"
91,11,"and sure enough, the man was behind me, bumper to bumper."
91,12,"I kept driving,"
91,13,while looking back to make sure the man didn't slam into me.
91,14,"The man was weaving left and right,"
91,15,he couldn't stay in one direction.
91,16,"So I thought, ""drunk driving is the number one killer of kids!"""
91,17,I thought that the man might be drunk.
91,18,"I figured that when I reached the next stop sign,"
91,19,I would turn around and go back to see what that man's problem was.
91,20,Because I wasn't sure if he was drunk or just sick.
91,21,Maybe he was having a heart attack or something.
91,22,I would've felt really bad if I saw in the news that a man died of a heart attack while driving
91,23,and I didn't do anything to help even though I was there.
91,24,When I reached the intersection I saw a police car parked at the other side of the street.
91,25,"I waved to the police car,"
91,26,and it drove over to me.
91,27,"I told the deputy, ""There's a man driving behind me, I don't know what his deal is, but I think he might be drunk or sick or something."
91,28,"Because he can't stay in one direction, he keeps driving into the opposite lane."""
91,29,The deputy went down the street to look for the man.
91,30,"When the man reached the intersection and saw me,"
91,31,he stopped his car
91,32,and then started going in reverse.
91,33,"He began to drive forward again,"
91,34,with the police car following behind him.
91,35,The man was driving slowly and carefully now.
91,36,I'm not sure if the police car ever stopped him.
92,1,"Two persons were going to a church softball game,"
92,2,the main character and Lisa.
92,3,On the way there a guy was blocking the freeway with their car.
92,4,"Later another car was acting weird,"
92,5,"not staying in lane,"
92,6,and tailgating.
92,7,The main character was suspecting that they are either drunk or having a heart attack.
92,8,"So he stops to inform a sheriff about it,"
92,9,but the car tailgating tries to avoid the cops.
93,1,I was on my way to a church league baseball game
93,2,that was organized by a high school
93,3,at the diamond
93,4,and had to get on ranch eggs and the twenty four.
93,5,"I noticed a driver in the car behind me,"
93,6,"he was middle-aged around 50,"
93,7,and when I started driving he was behind me.
93,8,I had Lisa in the car with me
93,9,and she said the man was right on my tail.
93,10,He was driving really close behind me
93,11,and I thought that he might be drunk.
93,12,I know drink driving is one of the biggest killers of kids
93,13,and I knew I had to do something.
93,14,But then I started to wonder
93,15,"if maybe he wasn't drunk but sick,"
93,16,that he might have a heart attack or something
93,17,and I'd see in the papers he'd died.
93,18,So I thought I had to do something.
93,19,I saw a patrol car
93,20,and stopped;
93,21,I went over to the police
93,22,and voiced my concerns about the driver.
93,23,By this point the driver had stopped a way away
93,24,and then began reversing slowly.
93,25,The police started following him
93,26,and he began to drive forward again
93,27,in a comical way.
94,1,"About a month ago while going to a church league softball game,"
94,2,it was at Homestead High School up at twenty four.
94,3,"While trying to turn at Ranch Egg,"
94,4,there was a guy sitting there.
94,5,He's about his middle fifties
94,6,and he blocks the lane.
94,7,I thought you jerk
94,8,and he got twenty four blocked.
94,9,"While the traffic cleared about a mile or 2 north of twenty four,"
94,10,this guy is following us
94,11,as we're going up this little hill
94,12,and my friend Lisa said this guy is on your tail
94,13,and I looked in the mirror
94,14,and saw him
94,15,and he's following bumper to bumper
94,16,and I make sure he doesn't hit me.
94,17,He sways from one lane to the other
94,18,and I think of how drunk driving is the number one killer of kids.
94,19,I tried to make up my mind on what to do.
94,20,He appeared drunk.
94,21,"When I get to the stop sign,"
94,22,I'll try to find out.
94,23,He may be drunk
94,24,or having a heart attack.
94,25,I knew I will feel bad
94,26,if I saw the news that a man died in a heart attack
94,27,while I thought he was drunk.
94,28,We saw a deputy
94,29,and I approached him
94,30,and told him that driver is maybe drunk or sick.
94,31,"And when the man saw me walk up to the deputy,"
94,32,he reversed and went backwards
94,33,and the deputy followed.
94,34,Then he turned
94,35,and the deputy did a U-turn.
94,36,Then he started driving slowly.
94,37,I don't know if he was caught
94,38,but it was really comical to watch.
95,1,About a month ago we were going to church game.
95,2,They had the game scheduled for the diamond at Homestead high school.
95,3,We went up twenty four
95,4,"and getting ready to turn at ranch eggs,"
95,5,slowing down for signal
95,6,"and this guy sitting on right coming to twenty four,"
95,7,looking in middle fifties.
95,8,He blocked the lane
95,9,and heading for the spot I'm going.
95,10,You know how you sit waiting for traffic to get by.
95,11,The guy starts pulling out in the lane
95,12,"and I thought ""you jerk"""
95,13,but I hurried and got ahead of him.
95,14,The guy sits in the middle of the highway blocked.
95,15,We went down soon
95,16,the traffic cleared
95,17,heading towards the diamond about two miles north of twenty four
95,18,and the guy is following us up the hill at ranch eggs.
95,19,Lisa said the guy is right on my tail.
95,20,I looked in the side mirror
95,21,and the guy was there bumper to bumper
95,22,and I tried to keep an eye on him making sure he doesn't slam on me.
95,23,He waves back and forth unable to keep in one lane.
95,24,All this time I think how drunk driving is the number one killer of people
95,25,"and how it's everybody's responsibility,"
95,26,trying to make up my mind on what to do.
95,27,I was sure he was drunk on how he appeared
95,28,and figured when we get to stop sigh
95,29,I'm going back and find out his problem because I think he was drunk
95,30,and I had to do something.
95,31,Or maybe he has heart attack you have to do something.
95,32,It'd be bad if I see in the papers of the guy died of heart attack.
95,33,I had made up my mind
95,34,so I pulled at the sign
95,35,I walked and reported him.
95,36,After he saw me going to the police he throws his car
95,37,and runs away.
95,38,The police start chasing him.
96,1,A person is on their way to the church softball game on 24th ave.
96,2,"On the way there,"
96,3,"they notice a car blocking the highway,"
96,4,so they take a detour.
96,5,"Suddenly an erratic driver begins following them,"
96,6,tailgating very closely.
96,7,"This makes the driver nervous,"
96,8,so they pull over.
96,9,Once pulled over the other driver does as well further back.
96,10,"A sheriff car is nearby,"
96,11,so the driver flags them down
96,12,"and tells them about the erratic driver,"
96,13,that they are possibly intoxicated or in need of medical assistance.
96,14,Suddenly the erratic driver shifts it in reverse
96,15,and takes off.
96,16,The sheriff follows suit.
97,1,"I [was] heading to church to [the] softball game,"
97,2,"as they have them all arranged,"
97,3,"and [I] was driving down the twenty-four,"
97,4,"when a male in his mid-50's pulls onto the highway,"
97,5,"[and] we were stuck for a second whilst traffic cleared,"
97,6,"but when it did,"
97,7,"I pulled off into the right lane,"
97,8,"[and] the man followed me,"
97,9,"and he got really close to my bumper,"
97,10,"and Lisa said how close he was to the bumper,"
97,11,"I thought he was drunk because he couldn't keep his car straight,"
97,12,"[and] he was weaving and really close,"
97,13,"then there was a stop sign coming up,"
97,14,"and I thought I will get out at the stop sign,"
97,15,"and go and check on him,"
97,16,"because even though I think he's drunk,"
97,17,"and drink driving is the biggest killer,"
97,18,"I also thought he may be sick,"
97,19,"and I didn't want to read about a man having a heart attack in his car,"
97,20,and not have done anything.
97,21,"When we approached the stop sign,"
97,22,"I saw a police car,"
97,23,"and waved the deputy over,"
97,24,"I got out [of] my car,"
97,25,"and approached the police,"
97,26,"and told them he was weaving around,"
97,27,"and he's probably drunk,"
97,28,"and when they went to approach him,"
97,29,"he started reversing back down the hill,"
97,30,"and the police followed him,"
97,31,"and when they caught up,"
97,32,"he started driving forward real slow,"
97,33,"and sensible,"
97,34,"and they followed,"
97,35,[and] I wonder if they caught up with him.
98,1,"About a month ago, see, we were going to a church league."
98,2,We had scheduled for high school.
98,3,"And I was slowing down to turn, signal."
98,4,There's this guy to the right.
98,5,Looked like he's about middle fifties.
98,6,And head heading for the same spot.
98,7,I'm going right there in the median.
98,8,But I hurried up and got there ahead of him.
98,9,Sitting there right in the middle of the highway.
98,10,"North of twenty-four, about centre at Ranch."
98,11,Eggs were going up this hill.
98,12,And this guy's on my tail.
98,13,I looked in the mirror.
98,14,"And sure enough, he's right up it."
98,15,Make sure he doesn't slam into me or anything.
98,16,I'm thinking how drunk driving is the number one killer of kids.
98,17,So I was trying to make my mind up what to do.
98,18,"So I figured when we get up to this stop sign, I'll ask him what his problem."
98,19,Like maybe he's having a heart attack or something.
98,20,Some guy died with a heart attack.
98,21,And there I was thinking he was drunk.
98,22,But I had made up my mind that I was going to.
98,23,So we pulled up at the stop sign.
98,24,And seen the sheriff.
98,25,So I told him this guy behind me can't keep his car on the road.
98,26,His got a problem.
98,27,"And as soon as he sees me call the sheriff, he drives off."
98,28,When the cops went down there to check him out.
98,29,He starts backing up.
98,30,Going backwards down the road.
98,31,And then starts forward again.
98,32,And just driving real slow.
98,33,I don't know if they ever stopped him or not.
99,1,I was driving towards the church softball tournament with Lisa
99,2,and we were driving along 24
99,3,"when I saw this guy trying to pull out on me,"
99,4,well I wasn’t having that
99,5,so I accelerated
99,6,and managed to get in front of this guy
99,7,who was now partially blocking the street.
99,8,I carried on my way along 24
99,9,when I noticed this guy was now following me
99,10,only he was weaving from lane to lane
99,11,and driving very erratically.
99,12,He got me worried now
99,13,and I commented on this to Lisa
99,14,and figured the guy could be drunk
99,15,and that’s pretty dangerous
99,16,as the main cause of deaths among kids is drunk drivers.
99,17,I saw a stop sign up ahead
99,18,and thought to myself
99,19,I’m going to stop here
99,20,and see what’s going on with this guy.
99,21,My first thought was that he was drunk
99,22,but he could be having a heart attack
99,23,or be really sick
99,24,and I’d feel pretty bad
99,25,if I didn’t check on this guy
99,26,and then read the news
99,27,that a guy had collapsed
99,28,and died
99,29,and I could have done something to help him.
99,30,So I stop at the stop sign
99,31,and get out of my car
99,32,and notice a sheriff’s vehicle on the other side of the intersection.
99,33,I go over to the sheriff
99,34,and explain the situation
99,35,and tell him he needs to go
99,36,and check on the guy behind me
99,37,who is acting strange
99,38,and is either drunk or sick.
99,39,Meanwhile the guy behind saw me going to talk to the cop
99,40,and starts backing down the road
99,41,"away from the cop,"
99,42,the cop keeps heading toward him
99,43,and the guy keeps backing
99,44,has car really slowly
99,45,and carefully away from the cop.
99,46,I never did find out what happened
99,47,and if the cop ever managed to catch up with him.
100,1,People are driving to church softball game at Homestead High School.
100,2,They are driving up twenty four.
100,3,Some vehicle in front of them starts trying to turn to where they are going.
100,4,It is blocking off the entire intersection.
100,5,"Eventually, they go past the vehicle."
100,6,The vehicle then starts erratically following them.
100,7,It is swerving all over the road.
100,8,They decide to pull over.
100,9,They see a sheriff's vehicle.
100,10,They then call over.
100,11,They talk to about the other vehicle.
100,12,It is being driven erratically.
100,13,They mention that the driver might be drunk.
100,14,The cops then chase the vehicle.
100,15,It backs up in reverse.
100,16,It then starts driving forwards.
100,17,It then switches back into reverse.
100,18,The narrator doesn't know if they ever caught the driver.
