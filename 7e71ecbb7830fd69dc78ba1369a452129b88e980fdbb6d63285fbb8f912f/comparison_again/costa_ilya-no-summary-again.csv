5d542c3a5af5900019bc80c4,"Mrs Costa's daughter, Marie, died about 38 years ago. She had had an operation in April for appendicitis and made a good recovery but died 10 days later. It was the day she was being discharged and she had her housecoat on. The Methodist hospital had rung the local shop to let them know Marie was ready to be discharged as the Costa's didn't have a home phone. Mrs Costa had to pay an extra $10 for her board. Mrs Costa told her other daughter to have coffee ready for them when they got back from the hospital. Mrs Costa;s sister had bought Marie an orange for when she got home. 
When Mrs Costa got to the hospital there was a delay and she wondered what was going on. The hospital kept ringing the shop to tell them to tell mrs costa to pick up Marie but the shop lady said she had already left. Eventually a nurse told Mrs Costa that there was a problem. She ran down the corridor and and saw Marie on the bed. She was covered in sweat.

Her daughter had been in hospital for an operation. The family didn't have a phone so they rang the local shop instead, to pass on the message that she was ready to be discharged. Her mother went in to collect her. She was in the waiting room when she saw a commotion and lots of nurses running around. No one was paying her any attention. In the end she ran down the corridor into her daughters room and saw her daughter lying dead on the bed. The doctors told her her daughter had just been walking down the corridor with a friend when she suddenly collapsed. There were no warning signs. 

I think the girl had a blood clot that killed her instantly. She had been in hospital for a couple of weeks

The womans husband died young because of it, I think it was heart related. 

The woman had to get her young son or nephew to tell the other relatives. 

There was something about asking someone else in the house to make a fresh pot of coffee, as her daughter had been looking forward to that. ",36.0,42.0

583c25b675d7c80001b73e9a,"The woman (Mrs Costa) was recounting how her daughter (Marie) died after with a blood clot after an operation for appendicitis 28 years ago. She blamed the hospital and doctors for moving her daughter which lead to the blood clot, something about moving her to a chair to start with and then something later on about Marie walking with someone and saying she couldn't see properly and her leg hurt. 
She got the call at home to come and pick her up so told her daughter Rita that she was going to pick her up. When she got there she was told to sit and wait and overheard something about another woman who had young daughters who was sick and she was praying for her. A nurse got a call and came and asked if her daughter had a history of fainting, they went to the room and her daughter was covered in sweat and she started yelling at the staff, her daughter passed away just before or after a doctor came in which she accused them of killing her daughter.
The mother was overwhelmed and freaked out to the point of banging her head against the wall and they wanted to give her a shot to calm her down and she accused them of wanting to kill her, and mentioned something about having a few operations (3?) that year so the staff knew her.
Rita came and was told and she dropped to the ground, which was explicitly mentioned as marble. Then they made her way home with her husband and mentioned that her husband died of a heart attack and also I think her brother but timeline is unclear on that. Her brother in law was an undertaker and she tried to call but couldn't get a hold of him so she sent her young son, and Mrs Costa's sister and I think sister in law thought the son was coming to say that Marie was home, but then they noticed the son's eyes were red.
Then it became a lot more rambling and I think it was a shopkeeper she had a conversation with about her daughter and that she was quiet and used to sit on the steps or something. That's about all I remember",52,125,"The woman was recounting in a very rambling and unnecessarily detailed way how her daughter had died from a blood clot after an operation for appendicitis and how it was the hospitals fault making her stand up and walk around. She started out being specific with dates, I think 28 years ago when her daughter died. 

She was at home and got a call while she was with her other daughter who was baking something, and was told she could come and pick her daughter up from the hospital. 
She got to the hospital and was told to take a seat, she recounted something about a friend or friends child who was in the hospital, she heard an emergency being called which I think prompted that, then a nurse asked her if her child had previously had any fainting spells or other medical problems. They made it to the woman's daughters room and during that time her daughter passed away. The woman became inconsolable and blaming the hospital for the death of her child to the point where they wanted to sedate her, she mentioned that they were trying to kill her like they did her daughter and other irrational things. The woman mentioned that she'd been in the hospital a number of times herself to the extent where she knew the staff and they her.

She recalled she got home and then launched into a thing saying things about how her husband and brother both died of heart attacks but didn't clarify until later in the rambling that it was much later on when in the initial context sounded like it was around the same time. 
Her young son met her when she got home where she told him the news and to go to her sister, the child's uncle or aunt, who's partner was either an undertaker or mortician, and recounted how the male wasn't there and how the woman and another woman there thought he was coming to tell them his sister was home from the hospital. 

Then she started talking about her daughter and her attributes, and how she went to the shops and spoke to the person behind the counter, and how her daughter who'd passed would sit at the steps.

When I got to visit my daughter, she went into a cold sweat. I was asked by the nurse if my daughter had ever gotten into a fainting spell. My daughter ended up bedridden, beads of sweat pouring from her face. I yelled at the nurses that they only kept killing her. 

They'd call for the doctor, who came in moments later. ""You're killing my daughter!"" I'd say again. ""You're killing her!""

""Please try and talk to her,"" the doctor would say.
