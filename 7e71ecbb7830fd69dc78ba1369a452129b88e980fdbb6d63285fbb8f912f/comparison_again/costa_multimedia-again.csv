The next day, Marie’s older sister, Victoria, went to visit her. At that time, they used a lot of ether during surgery, and Marie was still under its effects. There was a chair in the room because the hospital staff was beginning to get patients out of bed, but Marie was still too sick to be moved. Victoria questioned the nurse about the chair, and the nurse explained that it was the doctor’s orders to get her out of bed. Victoria was worried since Marie was still unconscious, but they insisted.
Later that afternoon, the woman was at home when she got a call from a neighbor at the store. The hospital had called, saying Marie was being discharged and that she needed to go pick her up. She told her daughter Rita to finish cooking and prepare coffee, as Marie always liked to have a cup of coffee first thing in the morning.
She prepared herself, taking her coat and Marie’s dress with her, and went to the hospital. When she arrived, the nurse asked her to sit down for a moment. While waiting, the woman prayed for another patient in the hospital, a mother with ten children who was in very bad shape.
Suddenly, the woman started to feel chills and cold sweats. The nurses noticed and asked if Marie had ever fainted before. Realizing something was seriously wrong, they rushed her into Marie’s room.
Marie was lying there in her slippers and housecoat, sweating heavily. The woman was devastated and accused the staff of killing her daughter. The doctor, a lady named Dr. Montique who assisted Dr. Schwartz during the operation, came in but admitted they didn’t know what had happened.
The woman became hysterical, pulling at her hair and banging her head against the wall. Marie was only eighteen years old, beautiful, and was supposed to be going home that day. But just as the woman turned her back, Marie passed away.
At home, the woman’s husband was waiting anxiously. The hospital kept calling the store asking when Marie’s mother would arrive, not knowing the tragedy that had happened.
The woman was so distraught that a doctor wanted to give her a sedative, but she refused, telling them they had already taken her daughter’s life, and she wasn’t about to let them take hers too.
Her daughter Rita came to the hospital, and when she saw her mother’s state, she collapsed on the floor from shock. Ever since that day, Rita has suffered from terrible pain in her leg like a hard pole running through it that lasts for weeks and makes walking difficult.

The cause of Marie’s death was later determined to be a blood clot. A girl who had been with Marie said that Marie had complained of pain in her leg and blindness before collapsing.

The woman was furious and refused to let anyone touch Marie’s body afterward.

When she finally went home, she was screaming loudly, drawing the attention of neighbors. She told her husband what had happened—they had lost Marie.

The entire family and neighborhood were shocked. Annie, a woman from the local store, still remembers Marie standing quietly on the step, a good and pleasant girl.

The hospital called to ask where the woman was and was she coming to pick up Marie. The son-in-law come to the hospital with the other daughter and found the woman screaming. The daughter fell to the floor with an ailment that can incapacitate her for 6 weeks at a time. It is like having a pole down her leg. The woman knew all the nurses because she'd had three operations there. In the car on the way home the woman screamed and screamed and her hair was standing on end. Everybody came out to look at the car with the screaming woman in. When they got home the woman told her husband that Marie was dead and sent her young son, James, to tell her two sisters. Jamie had red eyes when he got to his Aunties house. Her mother and sisters were shocked and Mrs Costa said she remembered Marie standing on the step.",35,84,"The woman had a daughter who recently died in hospital. Before she died the woman visited the hospital she was in and there was a chair in the room. The nurse was going to transfer the daughter from her bed to the chair. The woman said don't do that but the nurse said it was doctor's orders. While the daughter was being transferred she clapsed and got worse. Back at home the woman was waiting for the call to collect the daughter from the hospital and bring her home. The call never arrived so she went to her neighbour's house to call the hospital to find out what was happening. The hospital said why aren't you on your way. So she left to go to the hospital. Her husband came home and sat on the step waiting. Her two sister's waited. One had a huge orange. In the hospital a nurse was looking in a cupboard for blankets. The woman started to fret and sensed that something was wrong. She asked if the blankets were for her daughter (Rosa, maybe). Her daughter had collapsed and died. Now her other daughter (who likes coffee) and her son-in-law travelled in a car to the hospital. The nurse tried to give the woman a sedative but she refused it. She was distressed but knew the nurses as she'd been in the hospital for treatment three times before. When her other daughter arrived at the hospital, she collapsed in the hospital corridor and it felt like she had a pole running down her leg. They got in the car and travelled home to relay the news that the daughter was dead. The woman was wailing and all the neighbours came out to see what was going on. Realising that everyone was waiting for news she sent her youngest son to tell her sisters what had happened. He arrived at their house red-eyed. The neighbour who she had made the phone call from remembered that she liked the daughter who had died.",52.0,175.0
664cc974cb25cb2deeaa7ce3,"A older woman, Mrs. costa, is recalling how one of her daughters, Marie, passed away. Marie went into the hospital for an operation for appendicitis and afterwards while she was healing they were trying to get her to get out of bed earlier than she should have, and Mrs. Costa kept telling them dont make her but they did and she collapsed. This is what Mrs. Costa believes created the circumstances under which she got a blood clot and died later. So Marie had to stay at the hospital and Mrs. Costa went home and the whole family went about their business checking in on Marie regularly. Marie seemed to be doing better. Then one day Mrs. Costa got the phone call from the hospital to go pick Marie up that she was ready to come home (and maybe pay a $10 bill of some kind?). So Mrs. Costa got ready to go and told her other daughter Rita to make coffee because the dad was in the yard and would he would be home soon as would Maria and they both liked coffee in the morning. So Mrs. Costa went to pick up Maria and when she was there waiting she saw another woman she knew who was there because her own daughter was ill and Mrs. Costa had a lot of empathy for her and prayed for her as a mother. While this was happening there was a lot of commotion at the hospital all of a sudden and Mrs. Costa thought it had to do with someone else until one of the nurses came over and asked her a question about Marie falling down at which point Mrs. Costa started to get upset and ask if it was Marie that was actually crashing and the nurse said yes so she went with her. Marie was laying in the bed dying wearing her slipped and house coat and had huge drops of sweat. Mrs. Costa started freaking out and melting down in hysterics that they had killed her daughter (even though it seemed like she was dying but not actually dead yet?)They told her to talk to Marie but that seemed to trigger her into worse hysterics because what was she supposed to say to her dying daughter. And then her daughter actually died while she was melting down. Which, in turn, made her melt down all the more. The doctors and nurses were trying to calm her down and give her needles or medicines to help, but she refused and was being hostile yelling and screaming at them not to touch her. Meanwhile, the father was at home sitting on the steps waiting for her and Marie to come home. And Rita was still in the kitchen. The admin at the hospital didn't realize what had ahppened and so they were still calling the house asking for Mrs. Costa (her mother) to come and pick up Marie. It was realy confusing to Rita and her husband (I think? Mrs. Costa's son in law) and they thought maybe something had happened to Mrs Costa. So they went to the hospital to check. Rita saw her mom in the hall, who was still in hysterics and told Rita that Marie had died. Rita fell down becasue her leg clutched up because of some medical issue she has that maybe Marie also had? When they returned home Mrs. Costa told her husband who on the steps what happened and he had a heart attack and died. Then she told her son, and her son also had a heart attack and died. Mrs Costa's two sisters were waiting somewhere for Marie to co me home one had a giant orange to give her. Mrs. Costa told her youngest son James to go tell his two aunts what had happened and that Marie died so he ran down a clean street to tell them and they saw he had been crying. And she ended the story saying this is how Marie died. ",79,119,"A mother was recalling how one of her daughters, Maria, died. Maria had gone into hospital for her appendix. While there, the doctors or nurses tried to get her up and out of bed, even though her mother pushed back they made her get up anyways. The mother believes this is what led to a blood clot that would eventually lead to Maria's death. With Maria in the hospital, the mother went home and was going about her days and working in the family shop. Eventually she got a phone call that Maria was ready to go home. So she said to her other daughter Rita in the kitchen to make coffee because Maria loved to have that in the morning and the father would be coming home. So the mother went to the hospital to pick up Maria and pay a $10 bill. When she got there she was in the waiting room an saw another Mother very upset, her daughter was also in the hospital. The mother prayer for the other mother and her daughter because she wouldn't wish that on anyone. While this was going on, a nurse came by and asked a question about Maria to her mother and then all of a sudden there was some kind of hubbub around them with staff running into one of the rooms. The mother started crying and asking if this was about Maria and the nurse said yes and that she should come. So the mother went in and saw Maria lying on the bed with her slippers and housecoat and sweating so badly, huge drops of sweat. The mother was screaming at the doctor and nurses that they killed her daughter. The mother was in complete hysterics, even though her daughter wasn't dead just yet. The doctor told the mother to talk to her daughter but that just set her off worse and into more hysterics because what was she supposed to say to her dying daughter. While this was happening, Maria did die. They believe of a blood clot. 

Meanwhile, at home the father was sitting on the front steps waiting for the mother and maria to come home. And Rita was in the kitchen and the hosptial staff or admin kept calling asking them to come get Maria. Apparently there was a miscommunication and they were't aware of what was happening at the hospital with the mother and Maria. So Rita and her husband decided to go to the hospital to check, thinking something minor might have happened to the mother. When they arrived, Rita saw her mother in the hallway and her mother was crying and told her Maria had died. Rita suffered from some kind of condition and her legs gave out and she fell in the hallway. The doctors kept trying to give the mother pills or a shot to calm her down, but she refused and just kept screaming at them. 

After all of this the mother went home. The father was still sitting on the steps and asked where Maria was. The mother said she had died. The father then had a heart attack and he died. The mother went it the house and saw one of her elder sons and told him, and then he had a heart attack and died too. 

Maria's two aunts had been waiting for her to come home. One of them had a giant orange that she was going to give her. But they had left. So the mother told her young son James to go tell the aunts that Maria had died. So the young boy ran down a street that had been recently clean and when they saw him with red eyes they knew somethiing had happened. He told them and they were really sad. 

And this closed out the story the Mother was telling of how her daugher died, and what happened afterwards. ",56.0,122.0
63fab901a6a29bd9c8b39f89,"Marie Costas got sick and had an operation at a Methodist hospital on the afternoon of April 20, 28 years ago. It was a chilly day. Her mother narrates the story in the first person as she recalls what happened. Her daughter Victoria visited Marie in the hospital and wondered why there was a chair beside the bed. The nurse explained that Marie was expected to try to get out of bed and sit in the chair. Victoria felt it was too soon, but the nurse insisted they were the doctor's orders. Marie tried to get up but fell back on the bed. Marie's mother reflects, in hindsight, that this was evidence of the blood clot that would later take her life. Marie's mother said she was expecting to go and pick Marie up after her surgery, as soon as she was sufficiently recovered to return home. She didn't have a telephone in those days, but the lady at the local store had one, so on April 30, ten days after the operation, the hospital called the lady at the store and asked her to pass on the message to Marie's mother that she was ready to be discharged. Marie's mother told her daughter Rita to make a big pot of coffee in preparation for her sister's return, because Marie always loved coffee. The first cup of coffee every morning was set aside for Marie. Marie's clothes were ready and waiting on the kitchen table, so Marie's mother gathered them up and went to the hospital, with Marie's coat and dress over her arm. Meanwhile, Marie's father Mike went upstairs and shaved, then waited on the front steps for his daughter to come home. When Marie's mother got to the hospital, she was waiting patiently for Marie and praying for another woman she knew of in the same hospital who had surgery on her gallbladder. That woman had ten children, so Marie's mother prayed ""please don't let those children lose their mother."" Then she heard a young nurse's aide telling another nurse that a patient had broken out in a cold sweat. The nurse hung up the phone, and Marie's mother said ""please tell me you're not talking about my daughter."" They all rushed to Marie's room, where they saw her, still dressed in her housecoat. She had big drops of sweat visible on her skin and looked very ill. The male surgeon who had operated on Marie was not present, but a female doctor came to assess the situation. Marie's mother asked her what was wrong with Marie, but the doctor said she didn't know. Just as Marie's mother turned her back on her daughter, Marie died. Marie's mother was utterly distraught and described herself as hysterial. She was screaming and tearing out her hair. She wanted to know what had gone wrong, but nobody could tell her. The doctor and nurses wanted to sedate Marie's mother because she was so distraught and beating her head against the wall in an outburst of grief. Marie's mother adamantly refused to be sedated. Meanwhile, the people in the hospital's office didn't know Marie had died and were repeatedly trying to contact her family to come and collect her. They called the woman at the store, who contacted Marie. Marie's mother had a son-in-law who drove Rita to the hospital, where she found her mother. ""Marie has died,"" she told her daughter, and Rita immediately collapsed to the ground. Her leg was rigid like a pole due to the trauma of the fall, and Marie's mother explains that to this day she has a phlebitis-like pain in that leg for 8 or 9 weeks at a time. The doctor implied that she wanted to examine Marie's body, or possibly do an autopsy, to find out what killed her. Marie's mother refused, saying they must find out what killed her, but they were not to touch her daughter's remains. Marie's mother returned home with Rita, where Marie's father Mike was waiting. He asked what happened, and Marie's mother explained that Rita died. Mike was so distraught that he had a heart attack, then and there, in the kitchen. Then their son Michael came home and they broke the news to him. He too had a heart attack. Marie's mother had two sisters who had wanted her to let them know as soon as Marie came home. One of them had an orange for Marie, and it was an extraordinarily large orange. Marie's mother told her son Jamie, who was then a little boy, to run to the home of of his aunts and break the news. His aunts had been cleaning the pavement, and it was clean and shiny as Jamie came running towards them. ""Marie has died,"" he said. The lady who owned the store and has passed on phone message from the hospital would later tell Marie's mother that Marie was always a gentle and quiet presence in her store.",134,191,"A woman's daughter, Maria, was in hospital recovering after surgery. Another daughter went to visit her after the operation and noticed a chair beside the hospital bed. She asked a nurse why the chair was there and the nurse explained that the doctor wanted the patient to get out of bed and sit in the chair. The visiting daughter felt it was too soon for this, but the nurse insisted it was doctor's orders. Maria tried to get out of bed and fell backwards. The mother believed this was the first sign of the blood clot that would later kill her daughter. The mother had no phone, so when it was time for her daughter to be discharged, the hospital phoned a local shopkeeper who then let Maria's mother know. Maria had her daughter's clothes laid out on the table ready to go. She carried Maria's dress and coat over her arm and took them to the hospital. When she got there, she prayed as she waited for a woman with 10 children who was having gallbladder surgery. 'Please don't take this mother away from her children,' she prayed. A nurse's aide was on the phone nearby, and she stopped and spoke to a nurse in alarm. She said the patient had broken out in a cold sweat. 'Please don't tell me this commotion is about my daughter,' said Maria's mother. They rushed into her room and found Maria dripping with sweat and looking very ill. Maria's mother noticed large beads of sweat on her daughter's face. The moment she turned her back on her daughter, Maria died. Maria's mother was utterly hysterical and would not be comforted. She insisted on speaking to the doctor. The doctor who operated on her daughter was male, but the doctor who spoke to her was female. She said she couldn't explain why her daughter had died but they would try to find out. Meanwhile, the hospital's office didn't know Maria had died, and they kept phoning the shopkeeper to tell someone in Maria's family to come and collect her. One of Maria's sisters was driven to the hospital by a son-in-law of Maria's mother. When she got there, her mother broke the news that Maria was dead. Maria's sister fell to the ground and her leg was like a rigid pole. To this day she has pain in that leg like phlebitis. The doctor and nurses wanted to sedate Maria's mother because she was inconsolable. She was tearing out her hair and beating her head against the wall. She angrily refused to be sedated. The doctor said they would have to perform an autopsy on Maria, but her mother said 'no, you must find out what's wrong with her, but you will not touch my daughter's body.' Meanwhile, Maria's father Michael was at home waiting for her to return. He had gone upstairs to shave and was seated on the front step. When he heard the news that his daughter had died, he had a heart attack. Soon after that his son Mike came home and heard the news, and he too had a heart attack. The youngest son of the family, a little boy, was sent out to take the news to Maria's two aunts, who had asked to be informed as soon as she came home. One of the aunts had a special gift for her niece, an exceptionally large orange. The little boy ran down the cobbled street until he arrived at the aunts' home. They had been cleaning the driveway and it was shining and bright. 'Maria is dead,' the boy told his aunts. The shopkeeper later reflected that Maria was always a gentle and quiet presence in her store.",58.0,88.0

After 10 days Mrs Costa was told that she could pick up Marie as she was well enough to go home.
