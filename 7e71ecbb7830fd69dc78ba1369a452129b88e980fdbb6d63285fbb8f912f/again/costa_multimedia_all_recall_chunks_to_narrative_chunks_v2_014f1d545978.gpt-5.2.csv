Dropped to the floor, and that’s a marble floor. She went down like lightning. And the back of her leg, it felt just like a pole. Hard like a pole, the back of her leg."
68bee2290db3ddc555097eb6,She eventually developed a chronic leg condition that would last for months at a time.,"And that girl is suffering. Thirty – no, twenty-eight years since her sister died? When she gets that pain, it’s like she has phlebitis from it. She suffers – seven, eight, nine weeks at a time. She can’t walk, she goes through such pain since then."
68bee2290db3ddc555097eb6,The symptoms were eerily similar to the symptoms experienced by Mary before Mary died suddenly.,
68bee2290db3ddc555097eb6,"Meanwhile, hospital staff were trying to contain Marie but she was putting up a fight.",
68bee2290db3ddc555097eb6,"Finally, Marie went home and broke the news to her husband.","So when I got home – they took me home. I was screaming in the car. I couldn’t get out, you know, I couldn’t – I was screaming! Everybody came out, coming out of their doors because they could hear the screams. My husband was sitting on the step. He asked, “What’s the matter? What happened to you?” Well, my hair was all pulled, and my face – I was a mess. I didn’t know what I had done to myself. I said, “Mike, we lost Marie. Marie died.”"
68bee2290db3ddc555097eb6,He proceeded to have a heart attack.,"I said, “Mike, we lost Marie. Marie died.” It was just a shock. My husband had a heart attack. Yes, he had a heart attack."
68bee2290db3ddc555097eb6,"Later that night, Marie's son also had a heart attack.","Then my son, Michael, yeah. That night. Right there, my Michael came, and my Michael collapsed. He had a heart attack too, no kidding."
68bee2290db3ddc555097eb6,Family and friends slowly became aware of Marie's death.,"So, I got home and called everybody, told them what happened. I called my brother-in-law. He was an undertaker.

So they were waiting for my call, you know, but instead, I sent my son James, he was little then. I said, “Go tell Aunt Millie and Aunt Jenny.” They had cleaned the pavement, and done the cement work, and they were cleaning the pavement. They said, “Here comes little Jamie,” and now they said, “Maybe he’s come to tell us Marie’s home.” But when he got there, the poor kid’s eyes were all red. They said, “James, what’s the matter, honey? Why are you crying?” “Aunt Jenny, Aunt Millie, Marie died,” he said. Well, my sisters and my mother, you know, they were all alive. It was a shock to everybody."
664cc974cb25cb2deeaa7ce3,"A older woman, Mrs. costa, is recalling how one of her daughters, Marie, passed away.","My daughter died. It’ll be twenty-eight years this month. The thirtieth of this month, yeah."
664cc974cb25cb2deeaa7ce3,"Marie went into the hospital for an operation for appendicitis and afterwards while she was healing they were trying to get her to get out of bed earlier than she should have, and Mrs. Costa kept telling them dont make her but they did and she collapsed.","She died at Methodist Hospital. She had an operation for appendicitis. It was late Saturday afternoon when they operated, very late. Sunday morning, my oldest daughter, Victoria, went to the hospital to see how she was. She was still under ether. Back then, they used a lot of ether. There was a chair there. They were just starting to get people out of bed, you know. So, Victoria saw the chair, and she said to the nurse, “What’s this chair doing here?” The nurse said, “Well, we’ve got to get her out of bed.” She said, “What are you talking about? She’s still under ether.” “She’s too sick.” But the nurse said, “Well, that’s the doctor’s orders.” So, they went to get her out of bed, and she passed out, and they had to put her back in bed."
664cc974cb25cb2deeaa7ce3,This is what Mrs. Costa believes created the circumstances under which she got a blood clot and died later.,"See, here, she never – I don’t know if they knew or what, but I blame them for the blood clot she got, taking her out of bed."
664cc974cb25cb2deeaa7ce3,So Marie had to stay at the hospital and Mrs. Costa went home and the whole family went about their business checking in on Marie regularly.,
664cc974cb25cb2deeaa7ce3,Marie seemed to be doing better.,"So, when she was walking around to come home after ten days, I was waiting for the call from the hospital."
664cc974cb25cb2deeaa7ce3,Then one day Mrs. Costa got the phone call from the hospital to go pick Marie up that she was ready to come home (and maybe pay a $10 bill of some kind?).,"The lady from the store who had a phone called me, “Mrs. Costa,” at aquarter to five at night. “Mrs. Costa, they just called you from the hospital. Go Pick Marie up. She’s discharged.” ... They told me on the phone, it would be ten dollars more for her board."
664cc974cb25cb2deeaa7ce3,So Mrs. Costa got ready to go and told her other daughter Rita to make coffee because the dad was in the yard and would he would be home soon as would Maria and they both liked coffee in the morning.,"I had all the clothes laid out on the table. And Rita was – I was cooking, I said, “Rita, finish the cooking.” Daddy will be home soon.” He was working down in the yard. I said, “And put a big pot of coffee on,” because she had been wishing for coffee. And you know, every morning, that first cup of coffee, I offered it to her. When I get up in the morning, the first cup is hers. Since she’s gone, I never forget that."
664cc974cb25cb2deeaa7ce3,So Mrs. Costa went to pick up Maria and when she was there waiting she saw another woman she knew who was there because her own daughter was ill and Mrs. Costa had a lot of empathy for her and prayed for her as a mother.,"But when I got there, the nurse said to me, “Sit down, Mrs. Costa, sit here for a while.” So I sat down, and I was praying for another lady in the hospital that had an operation for her gall bladder. She lived near my sister, and she had ten children. They had said she was in very bad shape. I prayed, “Oh dear God, don’t take that mother away from her children.” I was praying for her, you know."
664cc974cb25cb2deeaa7ce3,While this was happening there was a lot of commotion at the hospital all of a sudden and Mrs. Costa thought it had to do with someone else until one of the nurses came over and asked her a question about Marie falling down at which point Mrs. Costa started to get upset and ask if it was Marie that was actually crashing and the nurse said yes so she went with her.,"Then a little nurse’s aide went to the closet and got some blankets. I started getting the chills, and I was thinking about it, when the aide said to the nurse, “Oh, she’s going into a cold sweat now.” The nurse hung up the phone and came to me. She said, “Mrs. Costa, has your daughter ever had a fainting spell?” “Oh my God!” I said, “Don’t tell me you’re running for my daughter!” “Yes,” she said, “come on in.” So, I went into the room."
664cc974cb25cb2deeaa7ce3,Marie was laying in the bed dying wearing her slipped and house coat and had huge drops of sweat.,"And my daughter was on the bed with her bedroom slippers and her housecoat on. And the beads of sweat – honest to God, not to exaggerate, they were that big. It came – just poured from her –"
664cc974cb25cb2deeaa7ce3,Mrs. Costa started freaking out and melting down in hysterics that they had killed her daughter (even though it seemed like she was dying but not actually dead yet?).,"I said, “What did you do, kill my daughter? You killed her! You killed her!” That’s what I kept yelling. ... And I was screaming. My hair was all pulled out. I went hysterical, you know what I mean?"
664cc974cb25cb2deeaa7ce3,They told her to talk to Marie but that seemed to trigger her into worse hysterics because what was she supposed to say to her dying daughter.,"The nurse said to me, “Talk to her.” I said, “Talk to her? My daughter’s dying, what am I supposed to tell her?” And I was screaming."
664cc974cb25cb2deeaa7ce3,And then her daughter actually died while she was melting down.,"And just as I turned my back, my daughter passed away. She was getting ready to go home."
664cc974cb25cb2deeaa7ce3,"Which, in turn, made her melt down all the more.","And I was screaming. My hair was all pulled out. I went hysterical, you know what I mean?"
664cc974cb25cb2deeaa7ce3,"The doctors and nurses were trying to calm her down and give her needles or medicines to help, but she refused and was being hostile yelling and screaming at them not to touch her.","And I was in the main hallway, at the office. I was all pulled apart. One doctor wanted to give me a shot. I said, “Get out of here, I’ll kick you,” I said. “You killed my daughter, now you want to kill me?” Another nurse came over. See, they all knew me. I had three operations in no time, not even a year. And I knew all the nurses. “Mrs. Costa, please, take –” “Get out!” I said, “Don’t you dare come near me.” I was so hysterical. I was banging my head against the wall and everything. They had to grab me."
664cc974cb25cb2deeaa7ce3,"Meanwhile, the father was at home sitting on the steps waiting for her and Marie to come home.","My husband was waiting for her. He came home, went upstairs to shave and wash, then sat on the step, waiting. “When is the mother coming?”"
664cc974cb25cb2deeaa7ce3,And Rita was still in the kitchen.,"And Rita was – I was cooking, I said, “Rita, finish the cooking.”"
664cc974cb25cb2deeaa7ce3,The admin at the hospital didn't realize what had happened and so they were still calling the house asking for Mrs. Costa (her mother) to come and pick up Marie.,"The hospital kept calling. The people in the office didn’t know what had happened yet. They kept calling the store, trying to reach us. They asked, “When is the mother coming to pick up Marie? She’s discharged.”"
664cc974cb25cb2deeaa7ce3,It was realy confusing to Rita and her husband (I think? Mrs. Costa's son in law) and they thought maybe something had happened to Mrs Costa.,"And Rita said “That’s strange, the mother went to the hospital. She should be there.” So they came back to the hospital to look for us. Rita said, “Gee, that’s strange,” she said, “Mother must’ve gotten really worked up about Marie.” You know, I’ve always had a bad heart. “Mother must’ve gotten so upset about Marie, she probably made herself sick,” Rita thought."
664cc974cb25cb2deeaa7ce3,So they went to the hospital to check.,"So she came over with my son-in-law, in the car."
664cc974cb25cb2deeaa7ce3,"Rita saw her mom in the hall, who was still in hysterics and told Rita that Marie had died.","And I was in the main hallway, at the office. I was all pulled apart. ... Then they brought me to the office, see. When Rita came in and saw me like that, she asked, “Mother, what happened?” I said, “We lost Marie. Marie died.”"
664cc974cb25cb2deeaa7ce3,Rita fell down becasue her leg clutched up because of some medical issue she has that maybe Marie also had?,"Well, that’s this one. This is a picture of Rita. She went down like lightning. Dropped to the floor, and that’s a marble floor. She went down like lightning. And the back of her leg, it felt just like a pole. Hard like a pole, the back of her leg. And that girl is suffering. Thirty – no, twenty-eight years since her sister died? When she gets that pain, it’s like she has phlebitis from it. She suffers – seven, eight, nine weeks at a time. She can’t walk, she goes through such pain since then."
664cc974cb25cb2deeaa7ce3,When they returned home Mrs. Costa told her husband who on the steps what happened and he had a heart attack and died.,"My husband was sitting on the step. He asked, “What’s the matter? What happened to you?” ... I said, “Mike, we lost Marie. Marie died.” It was just a shock. My husband had a heart attack. Yes, he had a heart attack."
664cc974cb25cb2deeaa7ce3,"Then she told her son, and her son also had a heart attack and died.","Then my son, Michael, yeah. That night. Right there, my Michael came, and my Michael collapsed. He had a heart attack too, no kidding."
664cc974cb25cb2deeaa7ce3,Mrs Costa's two sisters were waiting somewhere for Marie to co me home one had a giant orange to give her.,"My two sisters were here, waiting until about half-past four. They waited because they knew she was coming home that day, waiting for the call. My younger sister had brought an orange for Marie, and I had never seen an orange like it. It was a big orange, like that."
664cc974cb25cb2deeaa7ce3,Mrs. Costa told her youngest son James to go tell his two aunts what had happened and that Marie died so he ran down a clean street to tell them and they saw he had been crying.,"I sent my son James, he was little then. I said, “Go tell Aunt Millie and Aunt Jenny.” They had cleaned the pavement, and done the cement work, and they were cleaning the pavement. They said, “Here comes little Jamie,” and now they said, “Maybe he’s come to tell us Marie’s home.” But when he got there, the poor kid’s eyes were all red. They said, “James, what’s the matter, honey? Why are you crying?” “Aunt Jenny, Aunt Millie, Marie died,” he said."
664cc974cb25cb2deeaa7ce3,And she ended the story saying this is how Marie died.,"And how did they figure how Marie died? ... Later, they said it was a blood clot. ... That’s all. So that’s what happened."
611f672bc947518ca8b25524,The story tellers daughter was in hospital for some time and was visited by her mum.,"She died at Methodist Hospital. She had an operation for appendicitis. It was late Saturday afternoon when they operated, very late. Sunday morning, my oldest daughter, Victoria, went to the hospital to see how she was. She was still under ether."
611f672bc947518ca8b25524,During this time actions possibly led to a blood clot which maybe could have been avoided.,"So, Victoria saw the chair, and she said to the nurse, “What’s this chair doing here?” The nurse said, “Well, we’ve got to get her out of bed.” She said, “What are you talking about? She’s still under ether.” “She’s too sick.” But the nurse said, “Well, that’s the doctor’s orders.” So, they went to get her out of bed, and she passed out, and they had to put her back in bed. See, here, she never – I don’t know if they knew or what, but I blame them for the blood clot she got, taking her out of bed."
611f672bc947518ca8b25524,The storyteller appears confused like dementia or something.,
611f672bc947518ca8b25524,She goes to pick her daughter up on the day she is being discharged and on that day her daughter dies.,"So, when she was walking around to come home after ten days, I was waiting for the call from the hospital. I didn’t have a phone then. The lady from the store who had a phone called me, “Mrs. Costa,” at aquarter to five at night. “Mrs. Costa, they just called you from the hospital. Go Pick Marie up. She’s discharged.” ... So I said, “Put a pot of coffee on, and send for some cake from the bakery.” I’m going to get Marie; they called me.” ... So I sat down... The nurse hung up the phone and came to me. She said, “Mrs. Costa, has your daughter ever had a fainting spell?” “Oh my God!” I said, “Don’t tell me you’re running for my daughter!” “Yes,” she said, “come on in.” So, I went into the room. And my daughter was on the bed with her bedroom slippers and her housecoat on. And the beads of sweat – honest to God, not to exaggerate, they were that big. It came – just poured from her – I said, “What did you do, kill my daughter? You killed her! You killed her!” ... And just as I turned my back, my daughter passed away. She was getting ready to go home. I had the clothes and everything ready."
611f672bc947518ca8b25524,She has a panic attack at the hospital and does not trust the hospital staff.,"And I was screaming. My hair was all pulled out. I went hysterical, you know what I mean? ... And I was in the main hallway, at the office. I was all pulled apart. One doctor wanted to give me a shot. I said, “Get out of here, I’ll kick you,” I said. “You killed my daughter, now you want to kill me?” Another nurse came over. See, they all knew me.

611f672bc947518ca8b25524,When she gets home her husband who was waiting on the steps has a heart attack.,"My husband was waiting for her. He came home, went upstairs to shave and wash, then sat on the step, waiting. “When is the mother coming?” ... So when I got home – they took me home. I was screaming in the car.

611f672bc947518ca8b25524,I then found the story pretty confusing and hard to understand,
611f672bc947518ca8b25524,but there was a son who went to his aunts and told them Marie had died and an undertaker involved.,"I called my brother-in-law. He was an undertaker. My sister’s husband – he’s passed away now too. God rest his soul. Maybe you know him... So they were waiting for my call, you know, but instead, I sent my son James, he was little then. I said, “Go tell Aunt Millie and Aunt Jenny.” ... But when he got there, the poor kid’s eyes were all red. They said, “James, what’s the matter, honey? Why are you crying?” “Aunt Jenny, Aunt Millie, Marie died,” he said."

5e3d57c40d3a26000edff2e1,"However, she was dying when she got there.","But when I got there, the nurse said to me, “Sit down, Mrs. Costa, sit here for a while.” So I sat down, and I was praying for another lady in the hospital that had an operation for her gall bladder. ...

The lady from the store who had a phone called me, “Mrs. Costa,” at aquarter to five at night. “Mrs. Costa, they just called you from the hospital. Go Pick Marie up. She’s discharged.” I had all the clothes laid out on the table. And Rita was – I was cooking, I said, “Rita, finish the cooking.” Daddy will be home soon.” He was working down in the yard. I said, “And put a big pot of coffee on,” because she had been wishing for coffee.

And I went myself. You know, I had the coat on my arm. She was operated on in March – No, April! So that was the thirtieth. She was operated – ten days before, so that would be the twentieth. The twentieth of April, right? It was kind of chilly. Oh, and I had everything in a bag, and I had the coat on my arm and her dress hanging on my arm. She saw me from the windows, from Wolf Street. She said, “My mother’s just coming.” She was with the girls, saying goodbye to everyone – you know how it is.

But when I got there, the nurse said to me, “Sit down, Mrs. Costa, sit here for a while.” So I sat down... Then a little nurse’s aide went to the closet and got some blankets. I started getting the chills, and I was thinking about it, when the aide said to the nurse, “Oh, she’s going into a cold sweat now.” The nurse hung up the phone and came to me. She said, “Mrs. Costa, has your daughter ever had a fainting spell?” “Oh my God!” I said, “Don’t tell me you’re running for my daughter!” “Yes,” she said, “come on in.” So, I went into the room... And just as I turned my back, my daughter passed away. She was getting ready to go home. I had the clothes and everything ready."

And how did they figure how Marie died? The girl who was walking with Marie, told the doctor that Marie was saying goodbye to Arlene. And all Marie said to that girl was, “Oh, I’ve got a pain in my leg and I can’t see.” And then Marie collapsed. Later, they said it was a blood clot."
6091ab55ea2e97910519f8e7,She threatened to burn down the hospital.,"Later, they said it was a blood clot. I said, “Don’t you dare touch my daughter. I’ll burn this hospital down!

I said, “Talk to her? My daughter’s dying, what am I supposed to tell her?” And I was screaming. My hair was all pulled out. I went hysterical, you know what I mean?

And I was in the main hallway, at the office. I was all pulled apart. One doctor wanted to give me a shot. I said, “Get out of here, I’ll kick you,” I said. “You killed my daughter, now you want to kill me?” Another nurse came over. See, they all knew me... “Mrs. Costa, please, take –” “Get out!” I said, “Don’t you dare come near me.” I was so hysterical. I was banging my head against the wall and everything.

60b7e1bcfe148de04d17624b,and got ready and made sure to take my coat and dress in my arms as I went to the hospital.,"I had all the clothes laid out on the table. And Rita was – I was cooking, I said, “Rita, finish the cooking.” Daddy will be home soon.” He was working down in the yard. I said, “And put a big pot of coffee on,” because she had been wishing for coffee.

So I said, “Put a pot of coffee on, and send for some cake from the bakery.” I’m going to get Marie; they called me.” “All right, mother, go ahead,” she said, “I’ll finish up.” And I went myself. You know, I had the coat on my arm.

Oh, and I had everything in a bag, and I had the coat on my arm and her dress hanging on my arm."
60b7e1bcfe148de04d17624b,"Marie could see me from the windows, and she was saying goodbye to a lady who was next to her.","She saw me from the windows, from Wolf Street. She said, “My mother’s just coming.” She was with the girls, saying goodbye to everyone – you know how it is.

And how did they figure how Marie died? The girl who was walking with Marie, told the doctor that Marie was saying goodbye to Arlene."
60b7e1bcfe148de04d17624b,"Meanwhile, her father worked in the yard, and when he heard that I was going to the hospital, he shaved and got ready as he sat on the stairs.","Daddy will be home soon.” He was working down in the yard.

My husband was waiting for her. He came home, went upstairs to shave and wash, then sat on the step, waiting. “When is the mother coming?”"
60b7e1bcfe148de04d17624b,"I heard the nurses rushing and calling the doctors, and when I asked, ""What is going on?"" the nurse said it was my daughter.","Then a little nurse’s aide went to the closet and got some blankets. I started getting the chills, and I was thinking about it, when the aide said to the nurse, “Oh, she’s going into a cold sweat now.” The nurse hung up the phone and came to me. She said, “Mrs. Costa, has your daughter ever had a fainting spell?” “Oh my God!” I said, “Don’t tell me you’re running for my daughter!” “Yes,” she said, “come on in.”"
60b7e1bcfe148de04d17624b,"and so i yelled ""what did you do to my daughter?""","I said, “What did you do, kill my daughter? You killed her! You killed her!” That’s what I kept yelling."
60b7e1bcfe148de04d17624b,and Marie collasped on the floor and passed away,"And just as I turned my back, my daughter passed away.

And how did they figure how Marie died? The girl who was walking with Marie, told the doctor that Marie was saying goodbye to Arlene. And all Marie said to that girl was, “Oh, I’ve got a pain in my leg and I can’t see.” And then Marie collapsed."
60b7e1bcfe148de04d17624b,and i was screaming and yelling at the nurses,"And I was screaming. My hair was all pulled out. I went hysterical, you know what I mean?

And I was in the main hallway, at the office. I was all pulled apart."
60b7e1bcfe148de04d17624b,"and so the nurses wanted to give me the shot and i refused and told them, ""You want to kill me?""","One doctor wanted to give me a shot. I said, “Get out of here, I’ll kick you,” I said. “You killed my daughter, now you want to kill me?”"
60b7e1bcfe148de04d17624b,and i knew the all nurses because I had three operations at in less than a year.,"Another nurse came over. See, they all knew me. I had three operations in no time, not even a year. And I knew all the nurses."
60b7e1bcfe148de04d17624b,"I screamed as the doctors and nurses were taking my daughter, ""I'll burn this hospital to the ground if you touch my daughter. I don't care who dies in it,""","I said, “Don’t you dare touch my daughter. I’ll burn this hospital down! I don’t care who’s in it.” I said, “Don’t you dare touch my daughter. You want to find out what she died from.” But if you touch my daughter, I’ll kill you.”"
60b7e1bcfe148de04d17624b,"and at home, my other daughter, Victoria, was getting worried seeing that I was not home yet, because they were all excited to have Marie back home.","Sunday morning, my oldest daughter, Victoria, went to the hospital to see how she was.

The hospital kept calling. The people in the office didn’t know what had happened yet. They kept calling the store, trying to reach us. They asked, “When is the mother coming to pick up Marie? She’s discharged.” And Rita said “That’s strange, the mother went to the hospital. She should be there.”"
60b7e1bcfe148de04d17624b,"And so they came to the hospital looking for us, and when they saw me, I was in a mess and my hair was all pulled up,","So they came back to the hospital to look for us.

And I was in the main hallway, at the office. I was all pulled apart.

They told me on the phone, it would be ten dollars more for her board.

Then they brought me to the office, see.

When Rita came in and saw me like that, she asked, “Mother, what happened?”"
60b7e1bcfe148de04d17624b,"and and sent my son and who was little then, to go tell the two aunties that Marie passed away because they were also waiting for me and Marie to get home.","My two sisters were here, waiting until about half-past four. They waited because they knew she was coming home that day, waiting for the call.

So, I got home and called everybody, told them what happened.

So they were waiting for my call, you know, but instead, I sent my son James, he was little then. I said, “Go tell Aunt Millie and Aunt Jenny.”"
60b7e1bcfe148de04d17624b,"When my sisters saw my son crying, and when they asked him, he told them that Marie had passed away.","They said, “Here comes little Jamie,” and now they said, “Maybe he’s come to tell us Marie’s home.” But when he got there, the poor kid’s eyes were all red. They said, “James, what’s the matter, honey? Why are you crying?” “Aunt Jenny, Aunt Millie, Marie died,” he said."
60b7e1bcfe148de04d17624b,"And when my husband heard the news, he collapsed and had a heart attack, and my son Michael had a heart attack.","I said, “Mike, we lost Marie. Marie died.” It was just a shock. My husband had a heart attack. Yes, he had a heart attack.

Then my son, Michael, yeah. That night. Right there, my Michael came, and my Michael collapsed. He had a heart attack too, no kidding."
60b7e1bcfe148de04d17624b,I am not exaggerating.,"And the beads of sweat – honest to God, not to exaggerate, they were that big."
60b7e1bcfe148de04d17624b,So that is what happened.,That’s all. So that’s what happened.
58462977d2be990001174ae3,Marie went to the hospital for appendicitis.,She died at Methodist Hospital. She had an operation for appendicitis.
58462977d2be990001174ae3,"While recovering she was forced out of bed, and she died a few days later when her mother came to pick her up.","Sunday morning, my oldest daughter, Victoria, went to the hospital to see how she was. She was still under ether. Back then, they used a lot of ether. There was a chair there. They were just starting to get people out of bed, you know. So, Victoria saw the chair, and she said to the nurse, “What’s this chair doing here?” The nurse said, “Well, we’ve got to get her out of bed.” She said, “What are you talking about? She’s still under ether.” “She’s too sick.” But the nurse said, “Well, that’s the doctor’s orders.” So, they went to get her out of bed, and she passed out, and they had to put her back in bed. See, here, she never – I don’t know if they knew or what, but I blame them for the blood clot she got, taking her out of bed.

So, when she was walking around to come home after ten days, I was waiting for the call from the hospital. I didn’t have a phone then. The lady from the store who had a phone called me, “Mrs. Costa,” at aquarter to five at night. “Mrs. Costa, they just called you from the hospital. Go Pick Marie up. She’s discharged.” ... And I went myself. ... But when I got there, the nurse said to me, “Sit down, Mrs. Costa, sit here for a while.” ... She said, “Mrs. Costa, has your daughter ever had a fainting spell?” “Oh my God!” I said, “Don’t tell me you’re running for my daughter!” “Yes,” she said, “come on in.” So, I went into the room. And my daughter was on the bed with her bedroom slippers and her housecoat on. And the beads of sweat – honest to God, not to exaggerate, they were that big. It came – just poured from her – I said, “What did you do, kill my daughter? You killed her! You killed her!” ... And just as I turned my back, my daughter passed away. She was getting ready to go home. I had the clothes and everything ready."
58462977d2be990001174ae3,"Her mother told the story of preparing to go to the hospital, and the people who were in the family who expected Marie to be released.","So, when she was walking around to come home after ten days, I was waiting for the call from the hospital. I didn’t have a phone then. The lady from the store who had a phone called me, “Mrs. Costa,” at aquarter to five at night. “Mrs. Costa, they just called you from the hospital. Go Pick Marie up. She’s discharged.” I had all the clothes laid out on the table. And Rita was – I was cooking, I said, “Rita, finish the cooking.” Daddy will be home soon.” He was working down in the yard. I said, “And put a big pot of coffee on,” because she had been wishing for coffee. And you know, every morning, that first cup of coffee, I offered it to her. When I get up in the morning, the first cup is hers. Since she’s gone, I never forget that. So I said, “Put a pot of coffee on, and send for some cake from the bakery.” I’m going to get Marie; they called me.” “All right, mother, go ahead,” she said, “I’ll finish up.” And I went myself. You know, I had the coat on my arm. She was operated on in March – No, April! So that was the thirtieth. She was operated – ten days before, so that would be the twentieth. The twentieth of April, right? It was kind of chilly. Oh, and I had everything in a bag, and I had the coat on my arm and her dress hanging on my arm. She saw me from the windows, from Wolf Street. She said, “My mother’s just coming.” She was with the girls, saying goodbye to everyone – you know how it is.

And just as I turned my back, my daughter passed away. She was getting ready to go home. I had the clothes and everything ready. My husband was waiting for her.

She should be there.” ... So she came over with my son-in-law, in the car."
58462977d2be990001174ae3,"The mother went into a fit of rage after her daughter's death and threatened the staff, who she knew.","It came – just poured from her – I said, “What did you do, kill my daughter? You killed her! You killed her!” That’s what I kept yelling. And the doctor rushed in, see, they were trying to get the doctor, you know. She was a lady doctor. Dr. Schwartz actually did the operation, but she was his assistant, Dr. Montique. She was a lady doctor. So, she came in and she said – I said, “You killed my daughter – what did you do to her?” She said, “We don’t know what happened, Mrs. Costa.” She took me away from the bed. The nurse said to me, “Talk to her.” I said, “Talk to her? My daughter’s dying, what am I supposed to tell her?” And I was screaming. My hair was all pulled out. I went hysterical, you know what I mean?

... And I was in the main hallway, at the office. I was all pulled apart. One doctor wanted to give me a shot. I said, “Get out of here, I’ll kick you,” I said. “You killed my daughter, now you want to kill me?” Another nurse came over. See, they all knew me. I had three operations in no time, not even a year. And I knew all the nurses. “Mrs. Costa, please, take –” “Get out!” I said, “Don’t you dare come near me.” I was so hysterical. I was banging my head against the wall and everything.

... Later, they said it was a blood clot. I said, “Don’t you dare touch my daughter. I’ll burn this hospital down! I don’t care who’s in it.” I said, “Don’t you dare touch my daughter. You want to find out what she died from.” But if you touch my daughter, I’ll kill you.” I wouldn’t let them touch her."
58462977d2be990001174ae3,"The end of the story tells of her sending her young son to tell his aunts the news, and the mother calling family members to tell them of Marie's passing.","So when I got home – they took me home. ... So, I got home and called everybody, told them what happened. I called my brother-in-law. He was an undertaker. My sister’s husband – he’s passed away now too. God rest his soul. Maybe you know him... So they were waiting for my call, you know, but instead, I sent my son James, he was little then. I said, “Go tell Aunt Millie and Aunt Jenny.” They had cleaned the pavement, and done the cement work, and they were cleaning the pavement. They said, “Here comes little Jamie,” and now they said, “Maybe he’s come to tell us Marie’s home.” But when he got there, the poor kid’s eyes were all red. They said, “James, what’s the matter, honey? Why are you crying?” “Aunt Jenny, Aunt Millie, Marie died,” he said. Well, my sisters and my mother, you know, they were all alive. It was a shock to everybody."
