She lived near my sister, and she had ten children. They had said she was in very bad shape. I prayed, “Oh dear God, don’t take that mother away from her children.” I was praying for her, you know. Then a little nurse’s aide went to the closet and got some blankets. I started getting the chills, and I was thinking about it, when the aide said to the nurse, “Oh, she’s going into a cold sweat now.” The nurse hung up the phone and came to me. She said, “Mrs. Costa, has your daughter ever had a fainting spell?” “Oh my God!” I said, “Don’t tell me you’re running for my daughter!” “Yes,” she said, “come on in.” So, I went into the room. And my daughter was on the bed with her bedroom slippers and her housecoat on. And the beads of sweat – honest to God, not to exaggerate, they were that big. It came – just poured from her – I said, “What did you do, kill my daughter? You killed her! You killed her!” That’s what I kept yelling.

      <td>The narrator's daughter died in hospital, she's in hospital and was expected to come home but died in the hospital.</td>
      <td>My daughter died. It’ll be twenty-eight years this month. The thirtieth of this month, yeah. She died at Methodist Hospital. She had an operation for appendicitis. It was late Saturday afternoon when they operated, very late. Sunday morning, my oldest daughter, Victoria, went to the hospital to see how she was. She was still under ether. Back then, they used a lot of ether. There was a chair there. They were just starting to get people out of bed, you know. So, Victoria saw the chair, and she said to the nurse, “What’s this chair doing here?” The nurse said, “Well, we’ve got to get her out of bed.” She said, “What are you talking about? She’s still under ether.” “She’s too sick.” But the nurse said, “Well, that’s the doctor’s orders.” So, they went to get her out of bed, and she passed out, and they had to put her back in bed. See, here, she never – I don’t know if they knew or what, but I blame them for the blood clot she got, taking her out of bed. So, when she was walking around to come home after ten days, I was waiting for the call from the hospital. I didn’t have a phone then. The lady from the store who had a phone called me, “Mrs. Costa,” at aquarter to five at night. “Mrs. Costa, they just called you from the hospital. Go Pick Marie up. She’s discharged.” I had all the clothes laid out on the table. And Rita was – I was cooking, I said, “Rita, finish the cooking.” Daddy will be home soon.” He was working down in the yard. I said, “And put a big pot of coffee on,” because she had been wishing for coffee. And you know, every morning, that first cup of coffee, I offered it to her. When I get up in the morning, the first cup is hers. Since she’s gone, I never forget that. So I said, “Put a pot of coffee on, and send for some cake from the bakery.” I’m going to get Marie; they called me.” “All right, mother, go ahead,” she said, “I’ll finish up.” And I went myself. You know, I had the coat on my arm. She was operated on in March – No, April! So that was the thirtieth. She was operated – ten days before, so that would be the twentieth. The twentieth of April, right? It was kind of chilly. Oh, and I had everything in a bag, and I had the coat on my arm and her dress hanging on my arm. She saw me from the windows, from Wolf Street. She said, “My mother’s just coming.” She was with the girls, saying goodbye to everyone – you know how it is. They told me on the phone, it would be ten dollars more for her board. And to make sure I brought her girdle to put on. I said, “All right, I’ll be right over.” And I went. But when I got there, the nurse said to me, “Sit down, Mrs. Costa, sit here for a while.” So I sat down, and I was praying for another lady in the hospital that had an operation for her gall bladder. She lived near my sister, and she had ten children. They had said she was in very bad shape. I prayed, “Oh dear God, don’t take that mother away from her children.” I was praying for her, you know. Then a little nurse’s aide went to the closet and got some blankets. I started getting the chills, and I was thinking about it, when the aide said to the nurse, “Oh, she’s going into a cold sweat now.” The nurse hung up the phone and came to me. She said, “Mrs. Costa, has your daughter ever had a fainting spell?” “Oh my God!” I said, “Don’t tell me you’re running for my daughter!” “Yes,” she said, “come on in.” So, I went into the room. And my daughter was on the bed with her bedroom slippers and her housecoat on. And the beads of sweat – honest to God, not to exaggerate, they were that big. It came – just poured from her – I said, “What did you do, kill my daughter? You killed her! You killed her!” That’s what I kept yelling. And the doctor rushed in, see, they were trying to get the doctor, you know. She was a lady doctor. Dr. Schwartz actually did the operation, but she was his assistant, Dr. Montique. She was a lady doctor. So, she came in and she said – I said, “You killed my daughter – what did you do to her?” She said, “We don’t know what happened, Mrs. Costa.” She took me away from the bed. The nurse said to me, “Talk to her.” I said, “Talk to her? My daughter’s dying, what am I supposed to tell her?” And I was screaming. My hair was all pulled out. I went hysterical, you know what I mean? She was only eighteen years old. Beautiful girl, you can see from her picture. And just as I turned my back, my daughter passed away. She was getting ready to go home. I had the clothes and everything ready.</td>

      <td>And I went. But when I got there, the nurse said to me, “Sit down, Mrs. Costa, sit here for a while.” So I sat down, and I was praying for another lady in the hospital that had an operation for her gall bladder. She lived near my sister, and she had ten children. They had said she was in very bad shape. I prayed, “Oh dear God, don’t take that mother away from her children.” I was praying for her, you know. Then a little nurse’s aide went to the closet and got some blankets. I started getting the chills, and I was thinking about it, when the aide said to the nurse, “Oh, she’s going into a cold sweat now.” The nurse hung up the phone and came to me. She said, “Mrs. Costa, has your daughter ever had a fainting spell?” “Oh my God!” I said, “Don’t tell me you’re running for my daughter!” “Yes,” she said, “come on in.” So, I went into the room. And my daughter was on the bed with her bedroom slippers and her housecoat on. And the beads of sweat – honest to God, not to exaggerate, they were that big. It came – just poured from her – I said, “What did you do, kill my daughter? You killed her! You killed her!” That’s what I kept yelling. And the doctor rushed in, see, they were trying to get the doctor, you know. She was a lady doctor. Dr. Schwartz actually did the operation, but she was his assistant, Dr. Montique. She was a lady doctor. So, she came in and she said – I said, “You killed my daughter – what did you do to her?” She said, “We don’t know what happened, Mrs. Costa.” She took me away from the bed. The nurse said to me, “Talk to her.” I said, “Talk to her? My daughter’s dying, what am I supposed to tell her?” And I was screaming. My hair was all pulled out. I went hysterical, you know what I mean? She was only eighteen years old. Beautiful girl, you can see from her picture. And just as I turned my back, my daughter passed away. She was getting ready to go home. I had the clothes and everything ready.</td>

      <td>Sunday morning, my oldest daughter, Victoria, went to the hospital to see how she was. She was still under ether. Back then, they used a lot of ether... So, Victoria saw the chair, and she said to the nurse, “What’s this chair doing here?” The nurse said, “Well, we’ve got to get her out of bed.” She said, “What are you talking about? She’s still under ether.” “She’s too sick.” But the nurse said, “Well, that’s the doctor’s orders.” So, they went to get her out of bed, and she passed out, and they had to put her back in bed.</td>

      <td>She said the hospital had called them, telling them Marie was ready to come home, and everyone was expecting her with joy.</td>
      <td>So, when she was walking around to come home after ten days, I was waiting for the call from the hospital. I didn’t have a phone then. The lady from the store who had a phone called me, “Mrs. Costa,” at aquarter to five at night. “Mrs. Costa, they just called you from the hospital. Go Pick Marie up. She’s discharged.” I had all the clothes laid out on the table. And Rita was – I was cooking, I said, “Rita, finish the cooking.” Daddy will be home soon.” He was working down in the yard. I said, “And put a big pot of coffee on,” because she had been wishing for coffee. And you know, every morning, that first cup of coffee, I offered it to her. When I get up in the morning, the first cup is hers. Since she’s gone, I never forget that. So I said, “Put a pot of coffee on, and send for some cake from the bakery.” I’m going to get Marie; they called me.” “All right, mother, go ahead,” she said, “I’ll finish up.”\n\nHe came home, went upstairs to shave and wash, then sat on the step, waiting. “When is the mother coming?” The hospital kept calling. The people in the office didn’t know what had happened yet. They kept calling the store, trying to reach us. They asked, “When is the mother coming to pick up Marie? She’s discharged.”</td>

      <td>But when she got there, she found out Marie had collapsed, and later the doctors said it was a blood clot.</td>
      <td>And I went. But when I got there, the nurse said to me, “Sit down, Mrs. Costa, sit here for a while.” So I sat down, and I was praying for another lady in the hospital that had an operation for her gall bladder. She lived near my sister, and she had ten children. They had said she was in very bad shape. I prayed, “Oh dear God, don’t take that mother away from her children.” I was praying for her, you know. Then a little nurse’s aide went to the closet and got some blankets. I started getting the chills, and I was thinking about it, when the aide said to the nurse, “Oh, she’s going into a cold sweat now.” The nurse hung up the phone and came to me. She said, “Mrs. Costa, has your daughter ever had a fainting spell?” “Oh my God!” I said, “Don’t tell me you’re running for my daughter!” “Yes,” she said, “come on in.” So, I went into the room. And my daughter was on the bed with her bedroom slippers and her housecoat on. And the beads of sweat – honest to God, not to exaggerate, they were that big. It came – just poured from her – I said, “What did you do, kill my daughter? You killed her! You killed her!” That’s what I kept yelling. And the doctor rushed in, see, they were trying to get the doctor, you know. She was a lady doctor. Dr. Schwartz actually did the operation, but she was his assistant, Dr. Montique. She was a lady doctor. So, she came in and she said – I said, “You killed my daughter – what did you do to her?” She said, “We don’t know what happened, Mrs. Costa.” She took me away from the bed. The nurse said to me, “Talk to her.” I said, “Talk to her? My daughter’s dying, what am I supposed to tell her?” And I was screaming. My hair was all pulled out. I went hysterical, you know what I mean? She was only eighteen years old. Beautiful girl, you can see from her picture. And just as I turned my back, my daughter passed away.\n\nAnd how did they figure how Marie died? The girl who was walking with Marie, told the doctor that Marie was saying goodbye to Arlene. And all Marie said to that girl was, “Oh, I’ve got a pain in my leg and I can’t see.” And then Marie collapsed. Later, they said it was a blood clot.</td>

And I was in the main hallway, at the office. I was all pulled apart. One doctor wanted to give me a shot. I said, “Get out of here, I’ll kick you,” I said. “You killed my daughter, now you want to kill me?” Another nurse came over. See, they all knew me. I had three operations in no time, not even a year. And I knew all the nurses. “Mrs. Costa, please, take –” “Get out!” I said, “Don’t you dare come near me.” I was so hysterical. I was banging my head against the wall and everything. They had to grab me.\n\nLater, they said it was a blood clot. I said, “Don’t you dare touch my daughter. I’ll burn this hospital down! I don’t care who’s in it.” I said, “Don’t you dare touch my daughter. You want to find out what she died from.” But if you touch my daughter, I’ll kill you.” I wouldn’t let them touch her.</td>
