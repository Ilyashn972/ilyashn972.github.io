Thirty – no, twenty-eight years since her sister died? When she gets that pain, it’s like she has phlebitis from it. She suffers – seven, eight, nine weeks at a time. She can’t walk, she goes through such pain since then."
664cc974cb25cb2deeaa7ce3,"The doctors kept trying to give the mother pills or a shot to calm her down, but she refused and just kept screaming at them.","One doctor wanted to give me a shot. I said, “Get out of here, I’ll kick you,” I said. “You killed my daughter, now you want to kill me?” Another nurse came over. See, they all knew me. I had three operations in no time, not even a year. And I knew all the nurses. “Mrs. Costa, please, take –” “Get out!” I said, “Don’t you dare come near me.” I was so hysterical."
664cc974cb25cb2deeaa7ce3,After all of this the mother went home.,So when I got home – they took me home.
664cc974cb25cb2deeaa7ce3,The father was still sitting on the steps and asked where Maria was.,"My husband was sitting on the step. He asked, “What’s the matter? What happened to you?”"
664cc974cb25cb2deeaa7ce3,The mother said she had died.,"I said, “Mike, we lost Marie. Marie died.”"
664cc974cb25cb2deeaa7ce3,The father then had a heart attack and he died.,"My husband had a heart attack. Yes, he had a heart attack."
664cc974cb25cb2deeaa7ce3,"The mother went it the house and saw one of her elder sons and told him, and then he had a heart attack and died too.","Then my son, Michael, yeah. That night. Right there, my Michael came, and my Michael collapsed. He had a heart attack too, no kidding."
664cc974cb25cb2deeaa7ce3,Maria's two aunts had been waiting for her to come home.,"My two sisters were here, waiting until about half-past four. They waited because they knew she was coming home that day, waiting for the call."
664cc974cb25cb2deeaa7ce3,One of them had a giant orange that she was going to give her.,"My younger sister had brought an orange for Marie, and I had never seen an orange like it. It was a big orange, like that."
664cc974cb25cb2deeaa7ce3,But they had left.,
664cc974cb25cb2deeaa7ce3,So the mother told her young son James to go tell the aunts that Maria had died.,"I called my brother-in-law. He was an undertaker. My sister’s husband – he’s passed away now too. God rest his soul. Maybe you know him... So they were waiting for my call, you know, but instead, I sent my son James, he was little then. I said, “Go tell Aunt Millie and Aunt Jenny.”"
664cc974cb25cb2deeaa7ce3,So the young boy ran down a street that had been recently clean and when they saw him with red eyes they knew somethiing had happened.,"They had cleaned the pavement, and done the cement work, and they were cleaning the pavement. They said, “Here comes little Jamie,” and now they said, “Maybe he’s come to tell us Marie’s home.” But when he got there, the poor kid’s eyes were all red. They said, “James, what’s the matter, honey? Why are you crying?”"
664cc974cb25cb2deeaa7ce3,He told them and they were really sad.,"“Aunt Jenny, Aunt Millie, Marie died,” he said. Well, my sisters and my mother, you know, they were all alive. It was a shock to everybody."
664cc974cb25cb2deeaa7ce3,"And this closed out the story the Mother was telling of how her daugher died, and what happened afterwards.",That’s all. So that’s what happened.
56d56e550b5634000bdc5703,"There was a lady in the hospital, she was ill and the mother kept going to see her, they didnt want to believe that she was really ill.","So, I sat down, and I was praying for another lady in the hospital that had an operation for her gall bladder. She lived near my sister, and she had ten children. They had said she was in very bad shape. I prayed, “Oh dear God, don’t take that mother away from her children.” I was praying for her, you know."
56d56e550b5634000bdc5703,"The mother blamed herself, and was angry with medical staff.","See, here, she never – I don’t know if they knew or what, but I blame them for the blood clot she got, taking her out of bed.

I said, “What did you do, kill my daughter? You killed her! You killed her!” That’s what I kept yelling.

So, she came in and she said – I said, “You killed my daughter – what did you do to her?” She said, “We don’t know what happened, Mrs. Costa.”

And I was screaming. My hair was all pulled out. I went hysterical, you know what I mean?

And I was in the main hallway, at the office. I was all pulled apart. One doctor wanted to give me a shot. I said, “Get out of here, I’ll kick you,” I said. “You killed my daughter, now you want to kill me?” Another nurse came over. See, they all knew me. I had three operations in no time, not even a year. And I knew all the nurses. “Mrs. Costa, please, take –” “Get out!” I said, “Don’t you dare come near me.” I was so hysterical. I was banging my head against the wall and everything.

Later, they said it was a blood clot. I said, “Don’t you dare touch my daughter. I’ll burn this hospital down! I don’t care who’s in it.” I said, “Don’t you dare touch my daughter. You want to find out what she died from.” But if you touch my daughter, I’ll kill you.” I wouldn’t let them touch her."
56d56e550b5634000bdc5703,"Later they found out her daughter in the hospital had died, the mother blamed the hospital and would not believe the news.","So, I went into the room. And my daughter was on the bed with her bedroom slippers and her housecoat on. And the beads of sweat – honest to God, not to exaggerate, they were that big. It came – just poured from her – I said, “What did you do, kill my daughter? You killed her! You killed her!” That’s what I kept yelling.

She was only eighteen years old.

And just as I turned my back, my daughter passed away.

And how did they figure how Marie died? The girl who was walking with Marie, told the doctor that Marie was saying goodbye to Arlene. And all Marie said to that girl was, “Oh, I’ve got a pain in my leg and I can’t see.” And then Marie collapsed. Later, they said it was a blood clot.

I said, “Don’t you dare touch my daughter. I’ll burn this hospital down! I don’t care who’s in it.” I said, “Don’t you dare touch my daughter. You want to find out what she died from.” But if you touch my daughter, I’ll kill you.” I wouldn’t let them touch her."

It’ll be twenty-eight years this month. The thirtieth of this month, yeah. She died at Methodist Hospital. She had an operation for appendicitis. It was late Saturday afternoon when they operated, very late. Sunday morning, my oldest daughter, Victoria, went to the hospital to see how she was. She was still under ether. Back then, they used a lot of ether. There was a chair there. They were just starting to get people out of bed, you know. So, Victoria saw the chair, and she said to the nurse, “What’s this chair doing here?” The nurse said, “Well, we’ve got to get her out of bed.” She said, “What are you talking about? She’s still under ether.” “She’s too sick.” But the nurse said, “Well, that’s the doctor’s orders.” So, they went to get her out of bed, and she passed out, and they had to put her back in bed. See, here, she never – I don’t know if they knew or what, but I blame them for the blood clot she got, taking her out of bed. So, when she was walking around to come home after ten days, I was waiting for the call from the hospital. I didn’t have a phone then. The lady from the store who had a phone called me, “Mrs. Costa,” at aquarter to five at night. “Mrs. Costa, they just called you from the hospital. Go Pick Marie up. She’s discharged.” ... And just as I turned my back, my daughter passed away. She was getting ready to go home. ... And how did they figure how Marie died? The girl who was walking with Marie, told the doctor that Marie was saying goodbye to Arlene. And all Marie said to that girl was, “Oh, I’ve got a pain in my leg and I can’t see.” And then Marie collapsed. Later, they said it was a blood clot."
6091ab55ea2e97910519f8e7,Her husband and son-in law had heart attacks,"I said, “Mike, we lost Marie. Marie died.” It was just a shock. My husband had a heart attack. Yes, he had a heart attack.

You killed her! You killed her!” That’s what I kept yelling. ... And I was screaming. My hair was all pulled out. I went hysterical, you know what I mean? ... And I was in the main hallway, at the office. I was all pulled apart. One doctor wanted to give me a shot. I said, “Get out of here, I’ll kick you,” I said. “You killed my daughter, now you want to kill me?” Another nurse came over. See, they all knew me. ... “Get out!” I said, “Don’t you dare come near me.” I was so hysterical. I was banging my head against the wall and everything. They had to grab me. ... Later, they said it was a blood clot. I said, “Don’t you dare touch my daughter. I’ll burn this hospital down! I don’t care who’s in it.” I said, “Don’t you dare touch my daughter.

68bee2290db3ddc555097eb6,It all began when Maria was ill in the hospital with appendicitis; her name was Maria.,She died at Methodist Hospital. She had an operation for appendicitis.
68bee2290db3ddc555097eb6,"Maria collapsed when her sister Rita was visiting her, so there was uncertainty around her condition.","Then a little nurse’s aide went to the closet and got some blankets. I started getting the chills, and I was thinking about it, when the aide said to the nurse, “Oh, she’s going into a cold sweat now.” The nurse hung up the phone and came to me. She said, “Mrs. Costa, has your daughter ever had a fainting spell?” “Oh my God!” I said, “Don’t tell me you’re running for my daughter!” “Yes,” she said, “come on in.” So, I went into the room. And my daughter was on the bed with her bedroom slippers and her housecoat on.

...The nurse said to me, “Talk to her.” I said, “Talk to her? My daughter’s dying, what am I supposed to tell her?” And I was screaming.

...And just as I turned my back, my daughter passed away.

...When Rita came in and saw me like that, she asked, “Mother, what happened?” I said, “We lost Marie. Marie died.”"
68bee2290db3ddc555097eb6,"However, a week later, Mary was called to pick Maria up from the hospital.","So, when she was walking around to come home after ten days, I was waiting for the call from the hospital.

I said, “And put a big pot of coffee on,” because she had been wishing for coffee. And you know, every morning, that first cup of coffee, I offered it to her. When I get up in the morning, the first cup is hers. Since she’s gone, I never forget that. So I said, “Put a pot of coffee on, and send for some cake from the bakery.” I’m going to get Marie; they called me.”

...Oh, and I had everything in a bag, and I had the coat on my arm and her dress hanging on my arm.

...They told me on the phone, it would be ten dollars more for her board. And to make sure I brought her girdle to put on. I said, “All right, I’ll be right over.”"
68bee2290db3ddc555097eb6,"When she arrived at the hospital, Maria was saying goodbye to her hospital friends.","She saw me from the windows, from Wolf Street. She said, “My mother’s just coming.” She was with the girls, saying goodbye to everyone – you know how it is."
68bee2290db3ddc555097eb6,"Suddenly, Maria collapsed.","And how did they figure how Marie died? The girl who was walking with Marie, told the doctor that Marie was saying goodbye to Arlene.

68bee2290db3ddc555097eb6,It became clear that the situation was dire.,"So, I went into the room. And my daughter was on the bed with her bedroom slippers and her housecoat on. And the beads of sweat – honest to God, not to exaggerate, they were that big. It came – just poured from her"
68bee2290db3ddc555097eb6,"When Mary realized that Maria was not going to make it, she grew hysterical and blamed the hospital staff for murdering her daughter.","I said, “What did you do, kill my daughter? You killed her! You killed her!” That’s what I kept yelling.

...The nurse said to me, “Talk to her.” I said, “Talk to her? My daughter’s dying, what am I supposed to tell her?” And I was screaming. My hair was all pulled out. I went hysterical, you know what I mean?

68bee2290db3ddc555097eb6,"Meanwhile, back home, Rita and Mary's husband were wondering why Mary had not returned yet.","My husband was waiting for her. He came home, went upstairs to shave and wash, then sat on the step, waiting. “When is the mother coming?”

The hospital kept calling. The people in the office didn’t know what had happened yet. They kept calling the store, trying to reach us. They asked, “When is the mother coming to pick up Marie? She’s discharged.” And Rita said “That’s strange, the mother went to the hospital. She should be there.”"
68bee2290db3ddc555097eb6,Rita and her husband decided to drive to the hospital to see what was going on.,"So they came back to the hospital to look for us.

...“Aunt Jenny, Aunt Millie, Marie died,” he said. Well, my sisters and my mother, you know, they were all alive. It was a shock to everybody.

The neighborhood – Annie at the store always says, “Mrs. Costa,” every time I go in there, she reminds me, “I just picture Marie standing at that step, looking over here.”"
