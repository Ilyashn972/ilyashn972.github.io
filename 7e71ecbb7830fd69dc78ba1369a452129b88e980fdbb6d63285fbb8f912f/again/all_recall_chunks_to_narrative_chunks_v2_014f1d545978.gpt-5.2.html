      <td>So, I went into the room. And my daughter was on the bed with her bedroom slippers and her housecoat on. And the beads of sweat – honest to God, not to exaggerate, they were that big. It came – just poured from her – I said, “What did you do, kill my daughter? You killed her! You killed her!” That’s what I kept yelling. And the doctor rushed in, see, they were trying to get the doctor, you know. She was a lady doctor. Dr. Schwartz actually did the operation, but she was his assistant, Dr. Montique. She was a lady doctor. So, she came in and she said – I said, “You killed my daughter – what did you do to her?” She said, “We don’t know what happened, Mrs. Costa.” She took me away from the bed. The nurse said to me, “Talk to her.” I said, “Talk to her? My daughter’s dying, what am I supposed to tell her?” And I was screaming. My hair was all pulled out. I went hysterical, you know what I mean? She was only eighteen years old. Beautiful girl, you can see from her picture. And just as I turned my back, my daughter passed away.</td>
