5c6cc9e2ffe5270001d3e90c,Her sister was in the hospital with her and asked the nurses why the chair was placed there.,"Sunday morning, my oldest daughter, Victoria, went to the hospital to see how she was. She was still under ether. Back then, they used a lot of ether. There was a chair there. They were just starting to get people out of bed, you know. So, Victoria saw the chair, and she said to the nurse, “What’s this chair doing here?”"

And I was in the main hallway, at the office. I was all pulled apart. One doctor wanted to give me a shot.

I had three operations in no time, not even a year. And I knew all the nurses. “Mrs. Costa, please, take –” “Get out!” I said, “Don’t you dare come near me.” I was so hysterical. I was banging my head against the wall and everything. They had to grab me."
5c6cc9e2ffe5270001d3e90c,My other daughter came running in and collapsed on the floor.,"Then they brought me to the office, see. When Rita came in and saw me like that, she asked, “Mother, what happened?” I said, “We lost Marie. Marie died.” Well, that’s this one. This is a picture of Rita. She went down like lightning.

5c5cad3e4ee81200018eafe2,She went to see her the day after the operation but her daughter was still dozy from the anaesthetic and wanted to stay in bed.,"Sunday morning, my oldest daughter, Victoria, went to the hospital to see how she was. She was still under ether. Back then, they used a lot of ether."
5c5cad3e4ee81200018eafe2,But the doctor said she needed to get up and walk about.,"There was a chair there. They were just starting to get people out of bed, you know. So, Victoria saw the chair, and she said to the nurse, “What’s this chair doing here?” The nurse said, “Well, we’ve got to get her out of bed.” She said, “What are you talking about?

5c5cad3e4ee81200018eafe2,They tried to get her to get up so they could discharge her.,"So, they went to get her out of bed, and she passed out, and they had to put her back in bed.

So, when she was walking around to come home after ten days, I was waiting for the call from the hospital."
5c5cad3e4ee81200018eafe2,Mrs Costa went home to get her some clothes to wear for when they did discharge her but when she went back her daughter had died.,"The lady from the store who had a phone called me, “Mrs. Costa,” at aquarter to five at night. “Mrs. Costa, they just called you from the hospital. Go Pick Marie up. She’s discharged.” I had all the clothes laid out on the table. And Rita was – I was cooking, I said, “Rita, finish the cooking.” Daddy will be home soon.” He was working down in the yard. I said, “And put a big pot of coffee on,” because she had been wishing for coffee. And you know, every morning, that first cup of coffee, I offered it to her. When I get up in the morning, the first cup is hers. Since she’s gone, I never forget that. So I said, “Put a pot of coffee on, and send for some cake from the bakery.” I’m going to get Marie; they called me.” “All right, mother, go ahead,” she said, “I’ll finish up.” And I went myself. You know, I had the coat on my arm.

Oh, and I had everything in a bag, and I had the coat on my arm and her dress hanging on my arm.

But when I got there, the nurse said to me, “Sit down, Mrs. Costa, sit here for a while.”

She said, “Mrs. Costa, has your daughter ever had a fainting spell?” “Oh my God!” I said, “Don’t tell me you’re running for my daughter!” “Yes,” she said, “come on in.” So, I went into the room. And my daughter was on the bed with her bedroom slippers and her housecoat on. And the beads of sweat – honest to God, not to exaggerate, they were that big. It came – just poured from her – I said, “What did you do, kill my daughter? You killed her! You killed her!” That’s what I kept yelling.

She was only eighteen years old.

And just as I turned my back, my daughter passed away. She was getting ready to go home. I had the clothes and everything ready."
5c5cad3e4ee81200018eafe2,I think it was because she got a blood clot through not getting up and walking about so that wouldn't happen.,"See, here, she never – I don’t know if they knew or what, but I blame them for the blood clot she got, taking her out of bed.

And how did they figure how Marie died? The girl who was walking with Marie, told the doctor that Marie was saying goodbye to Arlene. And all Marie said to that girl was, “Oh, I’ve got a pain in my leg and I can’t see.” And then Marie collapsed. Later, they said it was a blood clot."
5c5cad3e4ee81200018eafe2,Mrs Costa was very angry and shouting and accused the hospital of killing her daughter.,"I said, “What did you do, kill my daughter? You killed her! You killed her!” That’s what I kept yelling.

I couldn’t get out, you know, I couldn’t – I was screaming! Everybody came out, coming out of their doors because they could hear the screams. My husband was sitting on the step. He asked, “What’s the matter? What happened to you?” Well, my hair was all pulled, and my face – I was a mess. I didn’t know what I had done to myself. I said, “Mike, we lost Marie. Marie died.”"
5c5cad3e4ee81200018eafe2,but so was so upset that she couldn't go and tell them so she got her son to do it instead.,"So, I got home and called everybody, told them what happened. I called my brother-in-law.

So they were waiting for my call, you know, but instead, I sent my son James, he was little then. I said, “Go tell Aunt Millie and Aunt Jenny.”"

Oh, and I had everything in a bag, and I had the coat on my arm and her dress hanging on my arm. She saw me from the windows, from Wolf Street. She said, “My mother’s just coming.” She was with the girls, saying goodbye to everyone – you know how it is. They told me on the phone, it would be ten dollars more for her board. And to make sure I brought her girdle to put on. I said, “All right, I’ll be right over.” And I went. But when I got there, the nurse said to me, “Sit down, Mrs. Costa, sit here for a while.” So I sat down...

So, I went into the room. And my daughter was on the bed with her bedroom slippers and her housecoat on."
675ab3f6c12c9e3fd27046b3,she became unwell.,"Then a little nurse’s aide went to the closet and got some blankets.

She said, “Mrs. Costa, has your daughter ever had a fainting spell?” “Oh my God!” I said, “Don’t tell me you’re running for my daughter!” “Yes,” she said, “come on in.” So, I went into the room.

And I was in the main hallway, at the office. I was all pulled apart. One doctor wanted to give me a shot. I said, “Get out of here, I’ll kick you,” I said. “You killed my daughter, now you want to kill me?” Another nurse came over. See, they all knew me. I had three operations in no time, not even a year. And I knew all the nurses. “Mrs. Costa, please, take –” “Get out!” I said, “Don’t you dare come near me.” I was so hysterical.

64772fe9752146745277bc45,sorry,
673feeafa80a279f5cc63e33,A young girl [Emily?] was in the hospital and it was time to come home.,"So, when she was walking around to come home after ten days, I was waiting for the call from the hospital. I didn’t have a phone then. The lady from the store who had a phone called me, “Mrs. Costa,” at aquarter to five at night. “Mrs. Costa, they just called you from the hospital. Go Pick Marie up. She’s discharged.”"
673feeafa80a279f5cc63e33,Her Mom [Linda?] went to pick up her up.,And I went myself.
673feeafa80a279f5cc63e33,When she got there she was told her daughter died she was very distraught and couldn't believe this happened and wanted answers she didn't want any nurses or doctors touching her daughter or herself at this point she was very confused of what went on at this hospital for her daughter to have died.,"But when I got there, the nurse said to me, “Sit down, Mrs. Costa, sit here for a while.” So I sat down, and I was praying for another lady in the hospital that had an operation for her gall bladder. She lived near my sister, and she had ten children. They had said she was in very bad shape. I prayed, “Oh dear God, don’t take that mother away from her children.” I was praying for her, you know. Then a little nurse’s aide went to the closet and got some blankets. I started getting the chills, and I was thinking about it, when the aide said to the nurse, “Oh, she’s going into a cold sweat now.” The nurse hung up the phone and came to me. She said, “Mrs. Costa, has your daughter ever had a fainting spell?” “Oh my God!” I said, “Don’t tell me you’re running for my daughter!” “Yes,” she said, “come on in.” So, I went into the room. And my daughter was on the bed with her bedroom slippers and her housecoat on. And the beads of sweat – honest to God, not to exaggerate, they were that big. It came – just poured from her – I said, “What did you do, kill my daughter? You killed her! You killed her!” That’s what I kept yelling. And the doctor rushed in, see, they were trying to get the doctor, you know. She was a lady doctor. Dr. Schwartz actually did the operation, but she was his assistant, Dr. Montique. She was a lady doctor. So, she came in and she said – I said, “You killed my daughter – what did you do to her?” She said, “We don’t know what happened, Mrs. Costa.” She took me away from the bed. The nurse said to me, “Talk to her.” I said, “Talk to her? My daughter’s dying, what am I supposed to tell her?” And I was screaming. My hair was all pulled out. I went hysterical, you know what I mean? She was only eighteen years old. Beautiful girl, you can see from her picture. And just as I turned my back, my daughter passed away.

...I was all pulled apart. One doctor wanted to give me a shot. I said, “Get out of here, I’ll kick you,” I said. “You killed my daughter, now you want to kill me?” Another nurse came over. See, they all knew me. I had three operations in no time, not even a year. And I knew all the nurses. “Mrs. Costa, please, take –” “Get out!” I said, “Don’t you dare come near me.” I was so hysterical. I was banging my head against the wall and everything. They had to grab me.

...Later, they said it was a blood clot. I said, “Don’t you dare touch my daughter. I’ll burn this hospital down! I don’t care who’s in it.” I said, “Don’t you dare touch my daughter. You want to find out what she died from.” But if you touch my daughter, I’ll kill you.” I wouldn’t let them touch her."
673feeafa80a279f5cc63e33,Her sister made coffee for when she arrived home.,"And Rita was – I was cooking, I said, “Rita, finish the cooking.” Daddy will be home soon.” He was working down in the yard. I said, “And put a big pot of coffee on,” because she had been wishing for coffee."

What happened to you?” Well, my hair was all pulled, and my face – I was a mess. I didn’t know what I had done to myself. I said, “Mike, we lost Marie. Marie died.”"
673feeafa80a279f5cc63e33,Linda's sister was supposed to come over after she brought Emily home had wondered why she hadn't heard from her.,"My two sisters were here, waiting until about half-past four. They waited because they knew she was coming home that day, waiting for the call. My younger sister had brought an orange for Marie, and I had never seen an orange like it. It was a big orange, like that. She said, “Mary, look, when they call you, when you pick Marie up, let us know, and we’ll come over.” I said, “All right.”"
673feeafa80a279f5cc63e33,When she told her husband he had a heart attack,"I said, “Mike, we lost Marie. Marie died.” It was just a shock. My husband had a heart attack. Yes, he had a heart attack."

When Rita came in and saw me like that, she asked, “Mother, what happened?” I said, “We lost Marie. Marie died.”"
67727a80c7d8eee59166d596,Her other daughter then fainted.,"Well, that’s this one. This is a picture of Rita. She went down like lightning. Dropped to the floor, and that’s a marble floor."
67727a80c7d8eee59166d596,The hospital wanted to help but the mum said you are not touching her as I don't want you to kill my other daughter as well.,"One doctor wanted to give me a shot.

607b0ffd5eba9d3a9d3f588d,"Later, hospital calls for the mother through store that has a cellphone that was closer to Soffy's home.","So, when she was walking around to come home after ten days, I was waiting for the call from the hospital. I didn’t have a phone then. The lady from the store who had a phone called me, “Mrs. Costa,” at aquarter to five at night. “Mrs. Costa, they just called you from the hospital. Go Pick Marie up.

5a6c8047e70ca900017acdae,I do not remember this at all.,
5a6c8047e70ca900017acdae,I think it’s like noise was a story that went off on many tangents so it was hard to follow,
583c25b675d7c80001b73e9a,The woman was recounting in a very rambling and unnecessarily detailed way how her daughter had died from a blood clot after an operation for appendicitis and how it was the hospitals fault making her stand up and walk around.,"My daughter died. It’ll be twenty-eight years this month. The thirtieth of this month, yeah. She died at Methodist Hospital. She had an operation for appendicitis. It was late Saturday afternoon when they operated, very late. Sunday morning, my oldest daughter, Victoria, went to the hospital to see how she was. She was still under ether. Back then, they used a lot of ether. There was a chair there. They were just starting to get people out of bed, you know. So, Victoria saw the chair, and she said to the nurse, “What’s this chair doing here?” The nurse said, “Well, we’ve got to get her out of bed.” She said, “What are you talking about? She’s still under ether.” “She’s too sick.” But the nurse said, “Well, that’s the doctor’s orders.” So, they went to get her out of bed, and she passed out, and they had to put her back in bed. See, here, she never – I don’t know if they knew or what, but I blame them for the blood clot she got, taking her out of bed.

And how did they figure how Marie died? The girl who was walking with Marie, told the doctor that Marie was saying goodbye to Arlene. And all Marie said to that girl was, “Oh, I’ve got a pain in my leg and I can’t see.” And then Marie collapsed. Later, they said it was a blood clot."
583c25b675d7c80001b73e9a,"She started out being specific with dates, I think 28 years ago when her daughter died.","My daughter died. It’ll be twenty-eight years this month. The thirtieth of this month, yeah."
583c25b675d7c80001b73e9a,"She was at home and got a call while she was with her other daughter who was baking something, and was told she could come and pick her daughter up from the hospital.","So, when she was walking around to come home after ten days, I was waiting for the call from the hospital. I didn’t have a phone then. The lady from the store who had a phone called me, “Mrs. Costa,” at aquarter to five at night. “Mrs. Costa, they just called you from the hospital. Go Pick Marie up. She’s discharged.” I had all the clothes laid out on the table. And Rita was – I was cooking, I said, “Rita, finish the cooking.” Daddy will be home soon.” He was working down in the yard. I said, “And put a big pot of coffee on,” because she had been wishing for coffee.

So I said, “Put a pot of coffee on, and send for some cake from the bakery.” I’m going to get Marie; they called me.” “All right, mother, go ahead,” she said, “I’ll finish up.” And I went myself."
583c25b675d7c80001b73e9a,"She got to the hospital and was told to take a seat, she recounted something about a friend or friends child who was in the hospital.","But when I got there, the nurse said to me, “Sit down, Mrs. Costa, sit here for a while.” So I sat down, and I was praying for another lady in the hospital that had an operation for her gall bladder. She lived near my sister, and she had ten children. They had said she was in very bad shape. I prayed, “Oh dear God, don’t take that mother away from her children.” I was praying for her, you know."
583c25b675d7c80001b73e9a,She heard an emergency being called which I think prompted that.,
583c25b675d7c80001b73e9a,Then a nurse asked her if her child had previously had any fainting spells or other medical problems.,"Then a little nurse’s aide went to the closet and got some blankets. I started getting the chills, and I was thinking about it, when the aide said to the nurse, “Oh, she’s going into a cold sweat now.” The nurse hung up the phone and came to me. She said, “Mrs. Costa, has your daughter ever had a fainting spell?”"
583c25b675d7c80001b73e9a,They made it to the woman's daughters room and during that time her daughter passed away.,"“Oh my God!” I said, “Don’t tell me you’re running for my daughter!” “Yes,” she said, “come on in.” So, I went into the room. And my daughter was on the bed with her bedroom slippers and her housecoat on. And the beads of sweat – honest to God, not to exaggerate, they were that big. It came – just poured from her – I said, “What did you do, kill my daughter? You killed her! You killed her!” That’s what I kept yelling.

...And just as I turned my back, my daughter passed away."
583c25b675d7c80001b73e9a,"The woman became inconsolable and blaming the hospital for the death of her child to the point where they wanted to sedate her, she mentioned that they were trying to kill her like they did her daughter and other irrational things.","I said, “What did you do, kill my daughter? You killed her! You killed her!” That’s what I kept yelling.

...And I was screaming. My hair was all pulled out. I went hysterical, you know what I mean?

...And I was in the main hallway, at the office. I was all pulled apart. One doctor wanted to give me a shot. I said, “Get out of here, I’ll kick you,” I said. “You killed my daughter, now you want to kill me?” Another nurse came over. See, they all knew me."
583c25b675d7c80001b73e9a,The woman mentioned that she'd been in the hospital a number of times herself to the extent where she knew the staff and they her.,"Another nurse came over. See, they all knew me. I had three operations in no time, not even a year. And I knew all the nurses."
583c25b675d7c80001b73e9a,She recalled she got home and then launched into a thing saying things about how her husband and brother both died of heart attacks but didn't clarify until later in the rambling that it was much later on when in the initial context sounded like it was around the same time.,"So when I got home – they took me home. I was screaming in the car. I couldn’t get out, you know, I couldn’t – I was screaming! Everybody came out, coming out of their doors because they could hear the screams. My husband was sitting on the step. He asked, “What’s the matter? What happened to you?” Well, my hair was all pulled, and my face – I was a mess. I didn’t know what I had done to myself. I said, “Mike, we lost Marie. Marie died.” It was just a shock. My husband had a heart attack. Yes, he had a heart attack. Then my son, Michael, yeah. That night. Right there, my Michael came, and my Michael collapsed. He had a heart attack too, no kidding."
583c25b675d7c80001b73e9a,"Her young son met her when she got home where she told him the news and to go to her sister, the child's uncle or aunt, who's partner was either an undertaker or mortician, and recounted how the male wasn't there and how the woman and another woman there thought he was coming to tell them his sister was home from the hospital.","So, I got home and called everybody, told them what happened. I called my brother-in-law. He was an undertaker. My sister’s husband – he’s passed away now too. God rest his soul.

So they were waiting for my call, you know, but instead, I sent my son James, he was little then. I said, “Go tell Aunt Millie and Aunt Jenny.” They had cleaned the pavement, and done the cement work, and they were cleaning the pavement. They said, “Here comes little Jamie,” and now they said, “Maybe he’s come to tell us Marie’s home.” But when he got there, the poor kid’s eyes were all red. They said, “James, what’s the matter, honey? Why are you crying?” “Aunt Jenny, Aunt Millie, Marie died,” he said."
583c25b675d7c80001b73e9a,"Then she started talking about her daughter and her attributes, and how she went to the shops and spoke to the person behind the counter, and how her daughter who'd passed would sit at the steps.","The neighborhood – Annie at the store always says, “Mrs. Costa,” every time I go in there, she reminds me, “I just picture Marie standing at that step, looking over here.” She used to stand at that step.
