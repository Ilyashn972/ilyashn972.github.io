            <h2>Experiment 1: Text-Based Story Recall</h2>
            <p><strong>Methodology:</strong> Subjects read a text-only story and wrote their recall immediately after reading. After one month, they wrote their recall again from memory.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Question:</strong> How does recall change over a long delay (1 month) when subjects only have textual input?</p>
        </div>
        <div class="experiment-description">
            <h2>Experiment 2: Multimedia Story Recall</h2>
            <p><strong>Methodology:</strong> Subjects listened to an illustrated story (audio + visual) and wrote their recall immediately after listening. After one week, they wrote their recall again from memory.</p>
            <p><strong>Key Question:</strong> How does recall change over a shorter delay (1 week) when subjects have both auditory and visual input?</p>

        <h2>1. Recall Length Analysis (Character Count)</h2>

            <h3>Experiment Comparison Summary</h3>
            <p><strong>Delay Period Effects:</strong> Experiment 1 (1-month delay) vs. Experiment 2 (1-week delay) allows us to examine how memory decay patterns differ across different time scales.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Input Modality Effects:</strong> Comparing text-only (Experiment 1) vs. multimedia input (Experiment 2) reveals how different sensory channels affect memory encoding and retrieval patterns.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Expected Patterns:</strong> 
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Recall Length (Characters):</strong> Longer delays typically show more points below the diagonal, indicating memory decay at the character level</li>
                <li><strong>Recall Length (Clauses):</strong> Longer delays typically show more points below the diagonal, indicating memory decay</li>
                <li><strong>Segment Coverage (N):</strong> Multimedia input may help maintain segment coverage over time</li>
                <li><strong>Abstractiveness (Fan-out):</strong> Delayed recalls often become more abstractive as details are lost but gist is preserved</li>
                <li><strong>Memory Profiles (Flow-in):</strong> Different input modalities may create different memory landscapes, with multimedia potentially enhancing memory for visual/action-oriented segments</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            
            <p><strong>Research Questions Addressed:</strong> These experiments together help answer fundamental questions about how memory encoding modality and delay period interact to shape recall patterns, abstractiveness, and the specific content that is most memorable over time.</p>
