4. they were trying to get her to get out of bed earlier than she should have,
5. and Mrs. Costa kept telling them don't make her
6. but they did
7. and she collapsed.
8. This is what Mrs. Costa believes created the circumstances under which she got a blood clot
9. and died later.
10. So Marie had to stay at the hospital
11. and Mrs. Costa went home
12. and the whole family went about their business checking in on Marie regularly.
13. Marie seemed to be doing better.
14. Then one day Mrs. Costa got the phone call from the hospital to go pick Marie up
15. that she was ready to come home
16. (and maybe pay a $10 bill of some kind?).
17. So Mrs. Costa got ready to go
18. and told her other daughter Rita to make coffee
19. because the dad was in the yard
20. and would he would be home soon
21. as would Maria
22. and they both liked coffee in the morning.
23. So Mrs. Costa went to pick up Maria
24. and when she was there waiting
25. she saw another woman she knew who was there because her own daughter was ill
26. and Mrs. Costa had a lot of empathy for her
27. and prayed for her as a mother.
28. While this was happening
29. there was a lot of commotion at the hospital all of a sudden
30. and Mrs. Costa thought it had to do with someone else
31. until one of the nurses came over
32. and asked her a question about Marie falling down
33. at which point Mrs. Costa started to get upset
34. and ask if it was Marie that was actually crashing
35. and the nurse said yes
36. so she went with her.

41. and melting down in hysterics
42. that they had killed her daughter
43. (even though it seemed like she was dying but not actually dead yet?)
44. They told her to talk to Marie
45. but that seemed to trigger her into worse hysterics
46. because what was she supposed to say to her dying daughter.
47. And then her daughter actually died
48. while she was melting down.
49. Which, in turn, made her melt down all the more.
50. The doctors and nurses were trying to calm her down
51. and give her needles or medicines to help,
52. but she refused
53. and was being hostile yelling and screaming at them not to touch her.
54. Meanwhile, the father was at home sitting on the steps waiting for her and Marie to come home.
55. And Rita was still in the kitchen.
56. The admin at the hospital didn't realize what had happened
57. and so they were still calling the house asking for Mrs. Costa to come and pick up Marie.
58. It was really confusing to Rita and her husband
59. (I think? Mrs. Costa's son in law)
60. and they thought maybe something had happened to Mrs Costa.
61. So they went to the hospital to check.
62. Rita saw her mom in the hall,
63. who was still in hysterics
64. and told Rita that Marie had died.
65. Rita fell down because her leg clutched up
66. because of some medical issue she has
67. that maybe Marie also had?
68. When they returned home
69. Mrs. Costa told her husband who on the steps what happened

30. Rita was in the kitchen.
31. The hospital staff or admin kept calling asking them to come get Maria.
32. Apparently, there was a miscommunication and they weren't aware of what was happening at the hospital with the mother and Maria.
