    "narrative": "We moved down to Third and uh Wharton. We had gotten moved but it was like \u2013 you remember I told you my father drank but it was still day and after he had gotten in and put the furniture where it was supposed to go my mother left to go to market to get some food to bring into the house. And my father went to take the horses \u2013 take the team of horses back. But he didn't come home. He \u2013 uh \u2013 I stopped somewhere on \u2013 I dunno but he \u2013 that's where \u2013 how he \u2013 why he wasn't in the house. And of course I was left there with the kids. Well no sooner did my mother get out of the house \u2013 my father went first \u2013 then \u2013 oh it was such an awful crash came through the window. And I \u2013 and I looked and it was a big stone. And then of course they \u2013 they \u2013 well they stoned the house. And I had sense enough to get the kids into the stairway so that they wouldn't get hurt by flyin' gla- glass. And I said to them \u201cNow you stay there. Don't move 'cause nothing will reach you here. And I'm gonna go and see if I can find mom\u201d \u2013 (We call our mother mom.) And they were crying and carryin' on. I was scared to death I really was frightened out of my wits. And I didn't know what to do but I remember saying a prayer as I went out the front door because I didn't know what was gonna hit me when I went out that door. And I ran \u2013 I was ten years old at the time this happened \u2013 I ran to Fourth street because I knew my mother wa- They had push carts in those days on Fourth street. And it was a Jewish neighborhood and they \u2013 they stayed open until \u2013 until all hours. Because they would you know however much money they could get they wanted. So uh that's where she was going to do her shopping. And I finally found my mother. I did find her. And while I was trying to tell her what had happened a policeman went by. And my voice was such that you could hardly make out what I was saying. I was so nervous and \u2013 and \u2013 my voice was shaking so and he wanted to find out what ha- what was wrong with me. And then when he understood what the situation was he turned to my mother and says \u201cThis is a bad neighborhood. It's Irish.\u201d And he said \u201cTh- they're known to do things like that Better move out of there.\u201d My mother said \u201cI just moved in how am I gonna move out?\u201d He says \u201cI dunno.\u201d He says \u201cBut they don't want any black people in there.\u201d An' he didn't say black 'cause they didn't use black then. But \u201cthey don't want anybody in there.\u201d So uh she said \u201cWell you're the law. You're supposed to protect us.\u201d He says \u201cI can't do anything with it.\u201d He was Irish himself. \u201cI can't do anything about it.\u201d So my mother said um \u201cWhere is the uh precinct you work from?\u201d And he told her. I forgot now. I was right there with her but I've forgotten where he told her. So uh she said \u201cWell if you can't do anything to help me I'll go see who \u2013 if I can't find someone else to help me.\u201d Well in those days black people were so cowed by circumstances an' uniforms an' \u2013 an' \u2013 an' white people you know they uh many times didn't assert themselves. But thankfully my mother was not one of those kind. And uh she \u2013 well I always thought of her as an educated person which she was because she was the only one I knew who had completed high school. She went to Lackawanna uh high school. And uh this was \u2013 let me see what year was this happening \u2013 well it must have been nineteen twenty-five so you can see what \u2013 what the times were. And we went \u2013 she took me and we went to the police station. And they also had police wagons with horses attached to them. Believe it or not in those days. [break in the recording] So my mother said to the captain \u201cWhat are you going to do about it?\u201d And he says \u201cWell lady there's nothing we can do about it.\u201d And she says \u201cYou mean to tell me that I have to live under those circumstances and there's nothing that you can do about it?\u201d She says \u2013 he says \u201cWell uh uh the only thing I can tell you to do is to move.\u201d He says \u201cBecause\u201d \u2013 uh he said to me \u201cDid you see anyone?\u201d And I said \u201cNo.\u201d He says \u201cWell how can \u2013 how can you\u201d \u2013 to my mother \u2013 \u201chow can you do anything if you don't know who \u2013 who to put the blame on?\u201d An' he says \u201cI'm sure there was more than uh than one person.\u201d So my mother said \u201cWell I don't know what I'm going to do.\u201d She says \u201cBut one thing I know I'm not going to do is move. Because I have no money to move with.\u201d They took all we had to to pay the rent. In that house you had to pay uh in advance. And she said \u201cIf they didn't want me there they should not have rented the house to me. Now the real estate agent should be accountable.\u201d So anyhow she said to him \u201cWell I know one thing you can do.\u201d And he says \u201cWhat's that?\u201d She says \u201cYou can take me home.\u201d He said \u201cTake you home?\u201d She said \u201cYes in the police patrol.\u201d So \u2013 I-I guess they figured \u201cLet's get this lady out of here because she's talking loud and long.\u201d And they had never come up with anybody like that. So they put us in the police patrol and they took us home. We weren't far from from \u2013 from where it was \u2013 maybe Fifth street \u2013 from where we had moved. And uh \u2013 course with the horses and the police patrol and the clang \u2013 they had a bell that clanged. Clang clang clang \u2013 you know they told you about the trolley that went \u201cClang.\u201d Well this police patrol that bell they had it went \u201cClang clang clang.\u201d And um all the neighbors came running out to see what was happening. And of course they saw the man came around the back \u2013 I can r- see it right now \u2013 from where he was sitting up front there where the horses came around and opened the door in the back. And they had a long door in the back where you had to come down steps to get out the back of the \u2013 of this police patrol. Well we got out of that police patrol \u2013 Before the patrol ever left my mother turned and faced all those people that were standing around and she says \u201cWhy you're doing this to me I don't know.\u201d She says \u201cI know that I am different from you color wise but in every other respect I'm just the same as you are and all I'm trying to do is provide a home for my family.\u201d She told them that they had rented the house she told them how much money she had paid she had told them that was all the money she had. And they had paid that rent for a month. She knew she was going to be there for the month. She did not know beyond the month. Whether they'd have enough mother \u2013 money to pay it for the next month. But she knew they were going to be there for for the month. She said \u201cIt is winter time and it is cold. And I cannot afford to be buying windows.\u201d \u201cNow\u201d she said \u201cWhoever threw the stones I don't know. But you can all see what has happened. And now I'm telling you that we're going to be here for a month. So you might just as well make up your mind to that. If you don't want me here then you people get together and give me enough money to move somewhere else. because I do not have it.\u201d Well of course you know they didn't do that. They probably didn't have any money either. So in the meantime \u2013 not in the meantime but during during the period of time that we were there my father became sick. And the neighbors were as nice as anybody could ever have been. When there was trouble they responded just like anyone else. But that was our welcoming to the neighborhood. And it was terrible and it certainly was frightening for me.",

        "22": "The mother called out all the neighbors while being dropped back off at their home by the police officer. Telling them if they want her and her family to go away they should pay them because they have no money left after the brutal robbery/stoning their window after their arrival. After a short while the father became ill and the neighbors actually helped out despite the awful racist welcoming they had from all the others because of their skin colour.  ",
        "23": "The mother spoke to the neighbors and said that they will stay there for a month as they had already paid in advance and cannot afford to move until then. She said if anyone is unhappy with that then they should get together and get the money to pay for them to move, but they obviously didn't do that as everyone was struggling with money. Sometime after it the father got sick and the neighbors were as nice as anyone could of been.",

        "26": "The police patrol had a bell that clanged, and all of the neighbours came out to see what was going on. They came through the back of the police patrol. The mother stood in front of the neighbours and told them that they were going to be there for a month, that they had paid the rent upfront for a month and she couldn't afford to move. If they wanted her to move then they would have to all gather up their money and pay for them to move somewhere else. They didn't have any money though. She said they would have to accept that they would be there for a month. And that she couldn't afford new windows. That they were different, but ultimately the same. Her husband got sick and the neighbours responded as though it was anyone else",
        "27": "When the police returned the mother and the boy home, she informed them of how much money she spent renting the house and that she doesn't have any money to fix broken windows nor rent another house. So she said, if they do not want me in that house, they should have at least said it. She then asked them to give her some of the money she used in paying for the rent so that she can find somewhere else to rent, but they also did not have any money to give to her. From there, the boy and his mother were taken to his father who was also sick.",
        "28": "The mother confronted the neighbours and said that although she was not the same skin colour as them, she was similar to them and was just trying to feed her family just like them. It seemed to work with the neighbours.",

Once they got home the mother spoke out to all the neighbors that they are paid up for the month. She told them how much it was and how much they had. They can't afford for move so they are stuck with them for the month. They also can't be affording any more broken windows. Now they don't know if they will still be there for the next month but if they don't want them there then the neighbors should get a collection going to help pay them to move out. Of course they didn't. She told them that she may look different from them (skin color) but she is the same as them. They did end up staying and the neighbors did become more neighborly. Eventually the father did get sick and the neighbors did help out. And this was their welcome into their new neighborhood.",

If they wanted us out then they could pay for us to move, but they were probably just as poor as us. It was a frightening time but it became clear that the neighbours were just like us and were very helpful when dad became ill. ",
        "32": "Basically, the police , when they arrived, they made a noise because it was 1925 and it was a horse-drawn wagon with bells on, which caused a commotion, and brought out all the neighbours to their doors. The mother was a proud and dignified woman and told those in the neighborhood (who were mostly Jewish, even though the officer said they were Irish), that she would not move as she only had a month's rent, which she had paid and could not afford to move. It appears that she didn't have the money to pay after that either. She told her neighbours, who were being racist by throwing stones at her window, that if they wanted her to move they would have to pay for it themselves, which they didn't do. They were poor themselves, perhaps they were a bit ashamed, but in case, for the remainder of the time they lived there they were good neighbours and even checked in when the father fell ill. The narrator, who was a boy at the time, finishes by saying that this was their introduction to the neighbourhood, which wasn't the best.",
        "33": "The police said if we wanted anything to change, we would need to move. My mother explained that we would need to stay, as we had no money after the move, given it had just happened. We explained to the neighbours that if they wanted us to not live in their neighbourhood, they would have to pay, however they didn't do so - likely, they had no money of their own. During the time we lived there, my father became sick, and when this happened our neighbours were very kind and supportive. It was a scary welcoming to the neighbourhood. ",

The boy's mother then told them about what had happened when she left her children to go to the grocery store. The windows were allegedly broken by neighbors who didn't want this family moving into their neighborhood because they were black. The mother then pleaded with them to accept her family, her family was poor and had used all the money they had to pay for the month's rent. They did not have money for repairing the broken windows and it was winter. The neighbors finally showed their support and acceptance of the family when the boy's father became ill.",
        "35": "The Police took the mother and boy home in the Police Patrol horse and cart. The bell of the cart clanged loudly and the people all came out of their houses to see what was occuring. The mother and boy came down the steps of the cart and the mother spoke loudly to the people that had gathered. She said she had no money to move. She said they would have to put up with her family for at least a month as that was when her rent was paid up to. She said that if they wanted her gone they could pay for her to move but she knew they wouldn't do that as they didn't have any money either. She said she just wanted to live quietly and look after her family. The people then treated her kindly and helped when her husband became sick. They rallied around. The boy ends by saying their move to this place had started by being terrifying and sickening.",

They then went to the house and the lady said to everyone i know you dont want me here but i have paid a months rent and im not sure i will have the money next month but for this month we will be here and i dont have any money to buy new windows. If you dont want us here you can all put together the money for us to rent somewhere else instead. The dad was poorly though and they actually treated him nicely. ",

She said she had paid rent for a month and was just trying to provide for her family. She didnt know why this was happening. If they didnt want someone like her to live in the house, they shouldnt have rented it to her however she wasnt going to move as she didnt have money. She didnt know what she was going to do beyond the month however for this month, she wasnt going to move as she didnt have money to. She said if the neighbours wanted her out, they should collectively give her money to move but they didnt.\n\nThe father became sick during this period, and the neighbour were as nice as could be but this was their terrifying welcome to Third and Wharton.

She told them that, apart from their skin colour, her family was the same as theirs and explained that, even if they have a problem with her being there, she paid all her money in rent that month so will be staying for at least a month unless they want to raise the money to fund her move.

Unless you all want to give me money to move, I will be staying for the month.\"\n\nOf course no one wanted to give money, they probably couldn't afford it themselves.

She said that would have to accept her as the family was going to be there for a month.  She didnt know what would be happening after that month.  She asked them to put forward some money, but of course, they didn't.  When the father came back he wasvery sick and then the people were as nice as they could be.",

She rented the house, and paid upfront for 1 month. She was unsure if she could afford the rented house for another month. It was winter time and it was cold, cannot afford to buy new windows. Mom doesnt know who through the stones but she know for sure that they will live there for atleast 1 month. The mother told the people if they dont want her here then they must give her enough money to pay for another house to rent. The mothers dad became sick.

And they had a long door in the back where you had to come down steps to get out the back of the - of this police patrol. \nwell we got out of that police patrol- Before the patrol ever left my mother turned and faced all those people that were standing around, and she says, \"why you're doing this to me i don't know.\" Sge says , \"I know  that i am different from you , colour wise, but in every other respect ,I'm just the same as you are, and all i'm trieng to do is provide a home for my family\"",

She made it clear they would at least be there for the month as they paid the rent upfront, and didn't have extra cash to move somewhere else. She suggested that if they wanted her gone, they should save up the money for her to move elsewhere with her family. \n\nAs time went on and the father fell sick, they found that the neighbours were very kind and generous.

The only difference between me and you all is the color of my skin.  I just moved in, it cost all my money to pay this month's rent, so for this month we'll be here unless you get us the money to move somewhere else!

Given she had no money to be fixing the broken window so the neighbours were free to pay for that so that she had money to move elsewhere when the month was up. This didn't happen but the neighbours were far more helpful when the father was then sick.",

On the way home, there were noises of bells from the patrol car which made everybody look outside their homes. Somebody opened the door for the mother and the boy, and there were long steps they had to walk out of. Lots of people were staring at the mother and the boy, and the mother asked \"why are you all doing this to us? I know we are different colors, but I already rented this house. I paid all the money I had for the whole month, so I'm unable to move elsewhere. If you want me to leave, then you can all group together and come up with money so I can move somewhere else\" The neighbours didn't do that, they probably didn't have any money either.

So then asked the people to gather some money and give to her, so that she can go rent another house somewhere else because it was winter, and she couldn't afford to fix windows and rent another place. This is because she had used all the money she had to rent the house. The people in the neighborhood clearly did not have any money to give to her. During that time, the boy's dad was sick. They couldn't go back to the place, and that was how they were welcomed into the new neighborhood on Fifth Street. It was a very frightening experience for the boy.",
        "79": "The police took the mom and boy home in the the police patrol, which made a clang, clang, clang sound, similar to the clang of a trolley. The patrol was long, with a door at the back. When they reached home, a crowd was gathered. The man, the police officer, climbed off his horse, went to the back of the patrol, and opened the door for us. My mother addressed the crowd, saying she didn't know why they'd stoned the house and broken the window. She said they'd used all the money they had to pay for one month's rent, and unless the people gathered wanted to pay for the family to move, they would be staying for the month. After that, she didn't know what would happen. She said they were no different than anyone else here.\nDuring the following month, the boy's father was ill, and the neighbours treated the family with kindness, helping them with food, etc.\nThat was the family's experience during the month of living in this place, a Black family in an Irish neighbourhood, dealing with Irish police.",
        "80": "And they came down from the long door at the back of the police patrol down the steps. And the mother said \"I may be different from you people colour wise, but I am the same in every other aspect\". She claimed what she had paid for the rent and that they would be there for at least the next month and that it being winter time she didn't have the money to keep buying windows. If they wanted her and her family to move they could all come up with the money for her to do so as she did not have it. They didn't do that, they likely didn't have nay money either. In that next month the father became sick. The neighbours were as nice as anybody. That was their welcome to the neighbourhood and it was terrible.",
        "81": "The mother insisted that the police escort her and her son back home on Third and Wharton via the police cart and horse. The police cart had a bell which was rung, making a loud clanging noise that attracted the neighbourhood, who all came out to see what was going on. As the mother got out of the vehicle, she defiantly addressed the crowd. She stated that although the colour of her skin was different, she was just the same as the people living in the neighbourhood. She simply wanted to provide a home for her family, and that she had given all of her money to pay for the rent for one month. This meant that she would not be going anywhere for the next month, and she was working hard to earn more money as she was unsure if she would have enough to continue paying the rent. She then referred to the accident when there was a group of people who were throwing stones through the window, which scared the boy and the siblings. \n\nAfter the incident, the boy's father got sick and the neighbourhood rallied around the family, offering to provide help where they could, and to stop any troublemakers causing harm to the family. The boy refers to the first time that they moved to the area as a terrifying and frightening time.",
        "82": "In this episode, a family is taken home by a police patrol after a troubling incident. The narrator vividly describes the sound of the patrol\u2019s bell\u2014\u201cclang clang clang\u201d\u2014as it approaches. Neighbors gather, curious about the commotion. The mother bravely confronts the crowd, expressing her frustration and asserting her humanity despite their racial differences. She explains that she\u2019s rented the house for a month, emphasizing her struggle to provide for her family during the cold winter, and challenges the neighbors to help if they don\u2019t want her there. Her determination shines through, highlighting both vulnerability and resilience in the face of prejudice.",
        "83": "The mother told the people that they had no money so they could not leave as they had paid a month and if they wanted them to leave they would need give them money which they did not have then the father became sick and the community rallied around and helped",
        "84": "do not remember",
        "85": "They climbed out of the police patrol and the mother turned to those standing there and said she didn't know why they were doing what they did. She said she knew she was different in color but said besides that, they were actually the same. She said the house they lived in was rented out and told them the price for & that was all she had so the family would stay there. She told them if they did not like it, they could come together and give her the money for her to move as she did not have any. The community did not give her any money and they stayed. The dad got sick and the community members were now nice & friendly to them and eventually were treated as part of the Irish community.",
        "86": "The mother got out of the police vehicle and loudly stated to the neighbourhood that they were staying put in the house for (at least) the next month, being that was the period of time that the rent (paid in advance) would cover. The mother then said that she did not have the money for window replacements that were damaged by the stones. The mother challenged the neighbours that if they wanted the family out of the house, they would need to pay them to leave as they had no money. It turned out that the neighbours probably also did not have money. Eventually the family settled nicely in the house, and the neighbours were the \"nicest neighbours ever\".",
        "87": "The mother said to the police that they don't know why they're doing this to her, all because she's different to them colour-wise, that she just wanted to be able to provide for her family. The boy then mentioned that they stayed there for the meantime, and while they were staying there his father got sick, and it was a very sad time for him.",
        "88": "They went in a horse drawn carriage, which had a bell, which went clang, clang, clang. All the neighbours noticed, and came out. This was a black family in a neighbourhood that didn't seem to want to accept them. The mother of the house then addressed the neighbours when they got back, and told them that they were staying for at least a month, and if they didn't like that, then they could pay up to allow them to move elsewhere, but no one did that, as they didn't have the money. Something changed, and the neighbours then started to accept them, when the father became ill.",
        "89": "The woman asked the police to take her home via a ppolice patrol van because she was talking loud. The police patrol had  a bell that clanged n people  came looking. the got out and looked at the people and they were looking at her because of her colour. She didnt have any money to pay rent for after a month or for fizing the house. she asked for enough money to leave her house so people can help her. ",
        "90": "The police patrol rolled up to the house and all the neighbours had come running due to the Clang,Clang,Clang of the bellon the police patrol. The boy and his mother stepped down from the back of the patrol when it stopped and the mother addressed the crowd of people assembled. She said that she was different colour wise but in all other respects was the same. She said that she did not know whom had thrown the stones. Ehe exxplained that she had rented the property for a month and that the rent had consumed all the money that she had and therefore she could not afford to leave and so was going to be there for a month unless the people would give her money to allow her to move. Of course this did not happen. When the father returned home he became sick and the neighbours were as nice as pie to them but what had happened as their first introduction to the neighbourhood had frightened and traumatised the boy so that he wouldalways remember it as an awful and scary time.",
        "91": "The mother wondered why she was allowed to rent in the first place if they didn't want her there. She told them the windows would need to be replaced since it's cold. She told them they would have to come up with the money together if they wanted her to move since she had none. They also had none so they let her live in peace.",
        "92": "They stopped and it was a long door they opened and the mum told them she was o oh different in colour but the same otherwise and that she only had the money she had paid for the month and if people wanted her to move they had to give her the money so she could get somewhere else. The persons dad became sick in that time, neighbours were very nice. But the welcoming had been awful and very frightening \nOk I\u2019m in max",
        "93": "After the mother and the boy were returned home, the mother saw all the neighbors standing there watching her. She told them all how much she had paid in rent for the month and told them that they were at least staying there a month.  She said she didn\u2019t know if they would have enough money to live there next month.  If the neighbors didn\u2019t want her living there, then they could give her enough money to move again, but none of them gave her any money. It was during this time that the father got sick however, the neighbors where is nice has anyone else would be",
        "94": "When police returned the mother and boy home home in convoy. They talked with the neighbors and told them that they do not have enough money to move out and how much money spent renting this house. If neighbors want them to move then gather some money and give it to mother and boy so that they can move out. Eventually everything settled up. Boy's father became ill, and neighbors were supporting.",
        "95": "when they returned home the people got out their houses to see what was going on and when the mother got off the carriage she said out loud so they can all hear \" why you're going this to me I don't know and I don't have money to move out because I just moved here, so if you don't want me here you can all put money together to help  me move to another place, and I don't have the money to buy new windows that you just broke\" they didn't give here the money because they also did not have the money. they stayed there for a while and the father fell ill and the neighbors were nice.",
        "96": "The mother berated them saying she was the same for them trying to provide for her family and couldn't afford to move. If they wanted her to move they would have to give her money becuase she could afford it.  The neighbours were nice when the father became ill",
        "97": "After the police returned the mother and the boy home, as the mother got out the police patrol and everyone came out to see what was happening due to the clang of the bell, she explained that she had paid rent for a month. therefore, she was going to stay there for that month and did not know if she would have enough money to stay longer. She mentioned it was winter and could no afford to fix the window and would have to cold enter her house. She asked for whoever broke it to fix it but no one did. She also explained that besides her color, she was no different from the people who lived there. she also said if they did not want her there, they should come together and pitch in with money so that she could afford to rent another house in a different place but that also did not happen. the little boy said that whole situation sacred him.",
        "98": "The neighbours heard the bell and horses of the police as they approached the mother\u2019s house.  The mother addressed the neighbours by saying why have they done this to her,  because apart from her colour they were the same, just trying to provide a home for her family.  She explained that they paid a months rent for this house and if they wanted her to move they would have to pay her some money,  so she could do that. She said that she didn't have any money to move, so they would have to stay there. Her husband who was a drinker became sick and the neighbours were nice and helped them.  Too be honest rather confused with the timeline as to when that happened! ",
        "99": "The police took them home and the mother confronted the neighbours. She told them that they could either raaise enough money for them to move or leave them alone. By standing up to them she gained their respect and they became supportive of the family."

The mother confronted the neighbours\n8. and said that they could not afford new windows.\n9. Look at what they had done\n10. and they had paid rent for a month\n11. and would be staying here for at least a month.\n12.

Mum and son went down steps\n5. out of the tall door\n6. at the back of the waggon\n7. and mum addressed the onlookers\n8. and said\n9. that like it or not\n10. she and her family are staying here for another month\n11. so if the neighbours don't like it\n12. they can all pay toward finding the family somewhere else to live,\n13. but no-one responded\n14. and no one wanted to pay for the windows.\n15. It seems like the family stayed\n16. because some time later the dad of the family got ill\n17. and the neighbours were nice about it.",
        "78": "1. When the police returned the mother and the boy home,\n2. somewhere on Fifth Street,\n3. the clang clang clang sound from the Police patrol alarmed everybody in the neighborhood,\n4. which made them come around.\n5. The man in the police patrol came out\n6. and also opened the door for the boy and his mother\n7. to make their way out of the Police Patrol.\n8. The mother then questioned the neighbors\n9. why they behaved in that manner towards her,\n10. asking them if they behaved liked that because she was black.\n11. She said if they did not want her in the neighborhood,\n12. then the house shouldn't have been rented to her in the first place\n13. and that it was the fault of the Real Estate Agency.\n14. So then she asked the people to gather some money\n15. and give to her,\n16. so that she can go rent another house somewhere else\n17. because it was winter,\n18. and she couldn't afford to fix windows and rent another place.\n19. This is because she had used all the money she had to rent the house.\n20. The people in the neighborhood clearly did not have any money to give to her.\n21. During that time, the boy's dad was sick.\n22. They couldn't go back to the place,\n23. and that was how they were welcomed into the new neighborhood on Fifth Street.\n24. It was a very frightening experience for the boy.",
        "79": "1. The police took the mom and boy home\n2. in the police patrol,\n3. which made a clang, clang, clang sound,\n4. similar to the clang of a trolley.\n5. The patrol was long,\n6. with a door at the back.\n7. When they reached home,\n8. a crowd was gathered.\n9. The man, the police officer, climbed off his horse,\n10. went to the back of the patrol,\n11. and opened the door for us.\n12. My mother addressed the crowd,\n13. saying she didn't know why they'd stoned the house\n14. and broken the window.\n15. She said they'd used all the money they had\n16. to pay for one month's rent,\n17. and unless the people gathered wanted to pay for the family to move,\n18. they would be staying for the month.\n19. After that, she didn't know what would happen.\n20. She said they were no different than anyone else here.\n21. During the following month, the boy's father was ill,\n22. and the neighbours treated the family with kindness,\n23. helping them with food, etc.\n24. That was the family's experience\n25. during the month of living in this place,\n26. a Black family in an Irish neighbourhood,\n27. dealing with Irish police.",

And the mother said \"I may be different from you people colour wise, but I am the same in every other aspect\".\n3. She claimed what she had paid for the rent\n4. and that they would be there for at least the next month\n5. and that it being winter time she didn't have the money to keep buying windows.\n6. If they wanted her and her family to move they could all come up with the money for her to do so as she did not have it.\n7. They didn't do that,\n8. they likely didn't have nay money either.\n9. In that next month the father became sick.\n10. The neighbours were as nice as anybody.\n11. That was their welcome to the neighbourhood\n12. and it was terrible.",

The police cart had a bell\n4. which was rung,\n5. making a loud clanging noise\n6. that attracted the neighbourhood,\n7. who all came out to see what was going on.\n8. As the mother got out of the vehicle,\n9. she defiantly addressed the crowd.\n10. She stated that although the colour of her skin was different,\n11. she was just the same as the people living in the neighbourhood.\n12. She simply wanted to provide a home for her family,\n13. and that she had given all of her money to pay for the rent for one month.\n14. This meant that she would not be going anywhere for the next month,\n15. and she was working hard to earn more money\n16. as she was unsure if she would have enough to continue paying the rent.\n17. She then referred to the accident\n18. when there was a group of people\n19. who were throwing stones through the window,\n20. which scared the boy and the siblings.\n\n21. After the incident,\n22. the boy's father got sick\n23. and the neighbourhood rallied around the family,\n24. offering to provide help where they could,\n25. and to stop any troublemakers causing harm to the family.\n26.
