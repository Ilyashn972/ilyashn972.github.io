0,1,The police returned the mother and boy home
0,2,in the police cart
0,3,with horses and a bell
0,4,"that went clang, clang, clang."
0,5,All the neighbours came out
0,6,to watch them coming home.
0,7,The mum spoke to them
0,8,and told them she had no money to move anywhere
0,9,so they would be there for the month
0,10,and maybe longer.
0,11,And that she couldn't afford to keep replacing windows
0,12,so they should stop breaking them
0,13,and accept they were there.
0,14,The neighbours were very nice to them
0,15,and when their dad got sick
0,16,were helpful.
1,1,They dropped them off in a police patrol
1,2,which was a horse and cart
1,3,and had steps.
1,4,The mother came down
1,5,and told the people
1,6,"why were they doing this to them,"
1,7,they were different colorwise
1,8,but same otherwise.
1,9,She was just providing for her family
1,10,and she was going to be here for a month.
1,11,The money had been spent on the rent
1,12,which was due in advance.
1,13,They were dropped off at fourth street.
1,14,The dad had been ill.
2,1,The police wagon was driven by horses
2,2,and made a loud clanging sound.
2,3,On arriving home
2,4,the neighbours heard all the clanging
2,5,and came outside to see what was happening.
2,6,The mother and the boy descended the steps at the back of the police wagon.
2,7,The mother confronted the neighbours
2,8,and said that they could not afford new windows.
2,9,Look at what they had done
2,10,and they had paid rent for a month
2,11,and would be staying here for at least a month.
2,12,The mother told the neighbours
2,13,that if they were not welcome here
2,14,and wanted them to move
2,15,then they should collect the money between them
2,16,to raise the rent
2,17,for them to move to a new house.
2,18,The mother and boy entered the house.
2,19,In the near future the father fell ill
2,20,and neighbours were very supportive
2,21,and kind to the family.
3,1,The police returned the mother and the boy home
3,2,in their police patrol car.
3,3,When they arrived
3,4,there were horses and wagons and people still there.
3,5,The mother stated that she wanted to find out who threw the stone through the window
3,6,as it was winter and cold
3,7,"and she could not afford a window,"
3,8,nor her rent.
3,9,She said the person who threw the stone should own up
3,10,or pay for her and her family to move out
3,11,so that they were not there anymore.
3,12,There was a discussion with the policeman regarding colour of skin and race.
3,13,The father came back
3,14,and he was sick.
4,1,A crowd was gathered
4,2,and the mother explained
4,3,that she had paid a month's rent
4,4,and only that.
4,5,She said it was cold
4,6,and she didn't have enough money to pay for the windows
4,7,and indeed may not have enough money for the next month's rent.
4,8,She said if the crowd wanted to pay the rent
4,9,she would move out
4,10,but nobody offered.
4,11,During the month
4,12,the father got sick
4,13,but the neighbours treated him well.
5,1,The mother and boy got out of the police cart.
5,2,the neighbours were all out
5,3,watching.
5,4,Mother said
5,5,"look what your all doing,"
5,6,I won't be leaving
5,7,in the next month
5,8,as can't afford it
5,9,if you want me gone
5,10,you give me the money.
5,11,I'm different in colour
5,12,but nothing else.
5,13,They stayed the month.
5,14,The father got ill
5,15,and the neighbours were helpful.
6,1,The mother described
6,2,"how much she paid in rent for the month,"
6,3,"her desire to simply provide a home for her family,"
6,4,and her lack of certainty
6,5,as to whether she would have the money
6,6,to pay for rent beyond the first month.
6,7,She also described
6,8,that their home lacked a window.
7,1,They returned the mother and boy home.
7,2,"The mother then went on a speech,"
7,3,telling the local crowd that had formed
7,4,all about the reality of their situation.
7,5,"They had no money to move,"
7,6,didn't understand why the locals were treating them so badly
7,7,and if they really wanted them gone
7,8,then they would have to find the money for her to rent elsewhere.
7,9,"Then a little time passes,"
7,10,the father becomes ill
7,11,"but the community is actually supportive,"
7,12,surprisingly after how they were treated.
7,13,"Seems to show that once you aren't treated as an outsider,"
7,14,"you become an insider,"
7,15,regardless of colour/race etc.
8,1,Now the real estate agent should be accountable.
8,2,"""So anyhow, she said to him, well I know one thing you can do."""
8,3,So they put us in the police patrol
8,4,and they took us home.
8,5,We were not far from
8,6,from where it was
8,7,maybe Fifth street.
8,8,"""Clang."""
8,9,"Well, this police patrol that bell they had, it went ""Clang clang clang."""
8,10,And um all the neighbors came running out to see what was happening.
8,11,I can see it right now
8,12,from where he was sitting
8,13,"up in front there where the horses came around,"
8,14,and open the door in the back.
8,15,And they had a long door in the back
8,16,where you had to come down steps to get out the back
8,17,of this police patrol.
8,18,We we got out of that police.
8,19,Before the patrol ever left
8,20,"my mother turned and faced all those people that were standing around,"
8,21,"and she says, ""Why you're doing this to me."""
8,22,"She says, ""I know that I am different from you, color wise,"
8,23,"in every other respect I am just the same as you are,"
8,24,"and all I'm trying to do is provide a home."""
8,25,"She told them that they had rented the house,"
8,26,"she told them how much money she had paid,"
8,27,she had told them that was all the money she had.
8,28,Whether they had have enough money to pay for it next month.
8,29,but she knew they were going to be there for a month.
8,30,"She said, it is winter time."
9,1,The mother said
9,2,"she doesn't have enough money to move,"
9,3,or pay for new windows
9,4,because it is winter.
9,5,And if the locals want her to move so badly
9,6,they should group together
9,7,and provide her with enough money to move somewhere else.
9,8,She told them
9,9,that even though her skin may be a different colour
9,10,she is just trying to provide for her family
9,11,like them.
9,12,The son then finishes
9,13,with that was what happened
9,14,when they moved in
9,15,"and it was ""terrible""."
10,1,"The mother confronted the neighbours,"
10,2,telling them
10,3,that she paid rent for the month.
10,4,That was all she had.
10,5,She was not moving.
10,6,"If they want her to move,"
10,7,then they have to pay her to move.
10,8,That didn't happen.
10,9,The husband was sick.
10,10,The neighbours were nice to them
10,11,after awhile.
11,1,the mother faced the crowd of Irish neighbours
11,2,that had come to see what the noise was about
11,3,"and she addressed them,"
11,4,explaining that she had moved there
11,5,and had given all her money to pay for the first month
11,6,and that if they did not like it
11,7,they could band together
11,8,"and give her enough money to move away,"
11,9,otherwise they would just have to deal with it.
11,10,she also explained
11,11,that the only real difference between them is their skin colour.
11,12,the boy then explains
11,13,that during the time that they lived there
11,14,the father became ill
11,15,and the neighbours were as nice as anyone could be.
12,1,The mother was explaining
12,2,"that although she has different skin colour,"
12,3,"everything else was the same,"
12,4,they were both people.
12,5,Skin colour doesn't define
12,6,or make people different.
13,1,The couple got out of the police car
13,2,and the mother faced the waiting crowd of neighbours.
13,3,She announced that she and her family were going to stay where they were for at least a month
13,4,as they had paid the rent
13,5,and didn't have the money to move again.
13,6,She told them that they were all the same
13,7,except for the colour of their skin.
13,8,She said the only way they would be able to get her family out
13,9,was to raise the cash needed to move.
13,10,In the meantime her husband was taken ill.
14,1,The police took the mother and boy home
14,2,in the police wagon
14,3,as it was easier
14,4,than listening to the mother.
14,5,"When they got back,"
14,6,the mother came out of the wagon
14,7,and saw the neighbors all looking out.
14,8,She told them
14,9,that they would be there for the whole month
14,10,as they had already paid a month's rent
14,11,and that they may as well get used to it
14,12,unless they wanted to give her money to move out.
14,13,The neighbors turned out to be nice people
14,14,and supported the family
14,15,when the father became sick.
15,1,The neighbours came out of the house
15,2,because the bell on the patrol was clanging.
15,3,They got out of the patrol
15,4,and went down some steps.
15,5,The mother confronted all of the neighbours
15,6,and said she was just the same as them in all respects
15,7,except her colour.
15,8,"[She said] that she was just trying to provide for her family,"
15,9,and that she couldn't afford to move
15,10,"so if they wanted her to go,"
15,11,that they would have to give her the money.
15,12,She told them how much she paid
15,13,and that she didn't know who had broken the window
15,14,but that winter was coming
15,15,and she was afraid of the cold.
15,16,The narrator reminds us that the experience was frightening.
16,1,THE WOMAN COMPLAINED
16,2,THAT THE STONES HAD HIT HER HOUSE
16,3,"AND THEY ALL HID IN THE STAIRCASE,"
16,4,"THE WOMAN ASKED THE POLICEMAN,"
16,5,WHO WAS BEING PULLED BY A HORSE
16,6,WHAT SHE SHOULD DO
16,7,AND HE TOLD HER
16,8,HE DIDN'T KNOW.
16,9,SHE QUESTIONED WHY HE COULDN'T HELP
16,10,AND HE SUGGESTED
16,11,"SHE MOVE HOUSE,"
16,12,SHE SAID
16,13,SHE COULDN'T AFFORD IT
16,14,BECAUSE SHE HAD PUT ALL HER MONEY INTO THE HOUSE
16,15,THEY ARE IN NOW.
17,1,The police dropped the mother and son at their home
17,2,in their horse drawn carriage.
17,3,The carriage had a bell
17,4,that went 'clang clang clang'.
17,5,Everyone in the neighbourhood could hear it
17,6,and came out to see what was happening.
17,7,The police opened the back door of the carriage
17,8,to let them out.
17,9,The mother looked around at the people staring
17,10,and told them that she had paid to live there a month
17,11,but was not sure if they would be there longer
17,12,as she did not have enough money for it.
17,13,She told them they would have to give them the money
17,14,if they wanted them to move elsewhere.
17,15,No one replied.
17,16,During that time the father got sick.
17,17,"The neighbours were all nicer after that,"
17,18,as much as they could be
17,19,and that was the introduction to the neighbourhood.
18,1,The neighbours responded in a nice way
18,2,and welcomed them
18,3,even when there was trouble
19,1,The mother and boy got out of the back of the police patrol
19,2,and the mother spoke to the neighbours
19,3,telling them they would be there for the month
19,4,as they could not afford to move.
19,5,She suggested if they wanted them out of the house
19,6,"they should raise the money between them for a move,"
19,7,they did not do this.
19,8,The father then became ill
19,9,and the neighbours were very helpful
19,10,and did whatever they could.
20,1,The mother stood out the front
20,2,after exiting the wagon
20,3,"and said loudly,"
20,4,"'we are here,"
20,5,the house was rented to us
20,6,"and we have paid for the month,"
20,7,so we will be here for the month.
20,8,I don't know if we can afford to pay for another month
20,9,but we will see.
20,10,It's winter
20,11,and it's cold
20,12,and a stone has been put through the window.
20,13,If you did this
20,14,you can make it right
20,15,by fixing it.'
20,16,but no one ever did.
20,17,The father got sick that month
20,18,and the neighbours were as nice as anything
20,19,also seeing off any trouble.
20,20,But to the boy
20,21,it still felt terrible
20,22,from his very first moment in that home.
21,1,The mother was clanging
21,2,"before the boy was returned home,"
21,3,that is all
21,4,I can recall.
22,1,The mother called out all the neighbors
22,2,while being dropped back off at their home
22,3,by the police officer.
22,4,Telling them
22,5,if they want her and her family to go away
22,6,they should pay them
22,7,because they have no money left
22,8,after the brutal robbery
22,9,stoning their window
22,10,after their arrival.
22,11,After a short while
22,12,the father became ill
22,13,and the neighbors actually helped out
22,14,despite the awful racist welcoming
22,15,they had
22,16,from all the others
22,17,because of their skin colour.
23,1,The mother spoke to the neighbors
23,2,and said
23,3,that they will stay there for a month
23,4,as they had already paid in advance
23,5,and cannot afford to move until then.
23,6,She said
23,7,if anyone is unhappy with that
23,8,then they should get together
23,9,and get the money
23,10,"to pay for them to move,"
23,11,but they obviously didn't do that
23,12,as everyone was struggling with money.
23,13,Sometime after it
23,14,the father got sick
23,15,and the neighbors were as nice as anyone could have been.
24,1,This was our welcoming to the neighbourhood.
25,1,The wagon had a bell on it
25,2,"and that clang clanged,"
25,3,so the neighbours came out of their houses
25,4,"to see what was going on,"
25,5,"when they got out of the back of the horse and wagon,"
25,6,the mother told all the people
25,7,how much she had paid to be there
25,8,and that they were paid up for the month
25,9,but she did not know about the month after that.
25,10,She had no more money
25,11,and was not going to move
25,12,"and she did not have new window money,"
25,13,she was there for the month whether they liked it or not.
25,14,If they objected to them being there
25,15,"then they could give her money to move on,"
25,16,but without it she was staying.
25,17,No one gave her any money
25,18,"but did leave them alone,"
25,19,when his father got sick
25,20,they did help out
25,21,just as any other neighbours would.
26,1,"The police patrol had a bell that clanged,"
26,2,and all of the neighbours came out
26,3,to see what was going on.
26,4,They came through the back of the police patrol.
26,5,The mother stood in front of the neighbours
26,6,"and told them that they were going to be there for a month,"
26,7,that they had paid the rent upfront for a month
26,8,and she couldn't afford to move.
26,9,If they wanted her to move
26,10,then they would have to all gather up their money
26,11,and pay for them to move somewhere else.
26,12,They didn't have any money though.
26,13,She said they would have to accept that they would be there for a month.
26,14,And that she couldn't afford new windows.
26,15,"That they were different,"
26,16,but ultimately the same.
26,17,Her husband got sick
26,18,and the neighbours responded as though it was anyone else.
27,1,"When the police returned the mother and the boy home,"
27,2,she informed them of how much money she spent renting the house
27,3,and that she doesn't have any money to fix broken windows
27,4,nor rent another house.
27,5,"So she said,"
27,6,"if they do not want me in that house,"
27,7,they should have at least said it.
27,8,She then asked them
27,9,to give her some of the money she used in paying for the rent
27,10,"so that she can find somewhere else to rent,"
27,11,but they also did not have any money to give to her.
27,12,"From there,"
27,13,the boy and his mother were taken to his father
27,14,who was also sick.
28,1,The mother confronted the neighbours
28,2,and said
28,3,"that although she was not the same skin colour as them,"
28,4,she was similar to them
28,5,and was just trying to feed her family
28,6,just like them.
28,7,It seemed to work
28,8,with the neighbours.
29,1,The police brought the mother and her son home.
29,2,The drawn horse police carriage had a bell that clanged.
29,3,That caused all the neighbors to come out to see what was happening.
29,4,"Once they got home, the mother spoke out to all the neighbors."
29,5,She told them that they are paid up for the month.
29,6,She told them how much it was.
29,7,She told them how much they had.
29,8,They can't afford to move.
29,9,So they are stuck with them for the month.
29,10,They also can't be affording any more broken windows.
29,11,Now they don't know if they will still be there for the next month.
29,12,But if they don't want them there then the neighbors should get a collection going.
29,13,The collection would help pay them to move out.
29,14,"Of course, they didn't."
29,15,She told them that she may look different from them (skin color).
29,16,But she is the same as them.
29,17,They did end up staying.
29,18,The neighbors did become more neighborly.
29,19,"Eventually, the father did get sick."
29,20,The neighbors did help out.
29,21,And this was their welcome into their new neighborhood.
30,1,"They told that they were staying for a month,"
30,2,"they didn't know if they were going to stay more than a month,"
30,3,"but at least a month they were staying,"
30,4,"and she told them if they want them out,"
30,5,"they needed to give them money to move out,"
30,6,and they didn’t do that.
30,7,"In the meantime, the father got sick,"
30,8,"and everyone was nice to them,"
30,9,but the welcoming was terrifying.
31,1,"On arriving back at the house,"
31,2,the mother explained to the mob of people outside
31,3,that she was aware
31,4,that they didn’t want us to be in that house because of our colour
31,5,but that she couldn’t afford to move anywhere else.
31,6,If they wanted us out
31,7,"then they could pay for us to move,"
31,8,but they were probably just as poor as us.
31,9,It was a frightening time
31,10,but it became clear
31,11,that the neighbours were just like us
31,12,and were very helpful when dad became ill.
32,1,"Basically, the police,"
32,2,"when they arrived,"
32,3,they made a noise
32,4,because it was 1925
32,5,and it was a horse-drawn wagon
32,6,"with bells on,"
32,7,"which caused a commotion,"
32,8,and brought out all the neighbours to their doors.
32,9,The mother was a proud and dignified woman
32,10,and told those in the neighborhood
32,11,"(who were mostly Jewish,"
32,12,"even though the officer said they were Irish),"
32,13,that she would not move
32,14,"as she only had a month's rent,"
32,15,which she had paid
32,16,and could not afford to move.
32,17,It appears that she didn't have the money to pay after that either.
32,18,"She told her neighbours,"
32,19,who were being racist
32,20,"by throwing stones at her window,"
32,21,that if they wanted her to move
32,22,"they would have to pay for it themselves,"
32,23,which they didn’t do.
32,24,"They were poor themselves,"
32,25,"perhaps they were a bit ashamed,"
32,26,"but in any case,"
32,27,for the remainder of the time they lived there
32,28,they were good neighbours
32,29,and even checked in when the father fell ill.
32,30,"The narrator,"
32,31,"who was a boy at the time,"
32,32,finishes by saying
32,33,"that this was their introduction to the neighbourhood,"
32,34,which wasn't the best.
33,1,The police said
33,2,"if we wanted anything to change,"
33,3,we would need to move.
33,4,My mother explained
33,5,"that we would need to stay,"
33,6,"as we had no money after the move,"
33,7,given it had just happened.
33,8,We explained to the neighbours
33,9,"that if they wanted us to not live in their neighbourhood,"
33,10,"they would have to pay,"
33,11,however they didn't do so
33,12,"- likely, they had no money of their own."
33,13,"During the time we lived there,"
33,14,"my father became sick,"
33,15,and when this happened
33,16,our neighbours were very kind and supportive.
33,17,It was a scary welcoming to the neighbourhood.
34,1,"When the Police Patrol arrived in the neighborhood,"
34,2,the neighbors came out of the house.
34,3,The boy's mother then told them about what had happened
34,4,when she left her children to go to the grocery store.
34,5,The windows were allegedly broken by neighbors
34,6,who didn't want this family moving into their neighborhood
34,7,because they were black.
34,8,"The mother then pleaded with them to accept her family,"
34,9,her family was poor
34,10,and had used all the money they had to pay for the month's rent.
34,11,They did not have money for repairing the broken windows
34,12,and it was winter.
34,13,The neighbors finally showed their support and acceptance of the family
34,14,when the boy's father became ill.
35,1,The Police took the mother and boy home
35,2,in the Police Patrol horse and cart.
35,3,The bell of the cart clanged loudly
35,4,and the people all came out of their houses
35,5,to see what was occurring.
35,6,The mother and boy came down the steps of the cart
35,7,and the mother spoke loudly to the people that had gathered.
35,8,She said she had no money to move.
35,9,She said they would have to put up with her family
35,10,for at least a month
35,11,as that was when her rent was paid up to.
35,12,She said that if they wanted her gone
35,13,they could pay for her to move
35,14,but she knew they wouldn't do that
35,15,as they didn't have any money either.
35,16,She said she just wanted to live quietly
35,17,and look after her family.
35,18,The people then treated her kindly
35,19,and helped when her husband became sick.
35,20,They rallied around.
35,21,The boy ends by saying their move to this place
35,22,had started by being terrifying and sickening.
36,1,The police returned them home
36,2,and the bells were loud
36,3,and went clang clang clang.
36,4,They then went to the house
36,5,and the lady said to everyone
36,6,I know you don’t want me here
36,7,but I have paid a month’s rent
36,8,and I’m not sure I will have the money next month
36,9,but for this month we will be here
36,10,and I don’t have any money to buy new windows.
36,11,If you don’t want us here
36,12,you can all put together the money for us to rent somewhere else instead.
36,13,The dad was poorly though
36,14,and they actually treated him nicely.
37,1,The police returned them home
37,2,and the mother was saying
37,3,they shouldn't have rented the house to them
37,4,if they didn't want them there.
37,5,And they were worried
37,6,about how cold it was
37,7,with the broken window.
38,1,"When they came home,"
38,2,everybody was out
38,3,and had surrounded the police car
38,4,and the mother asked
38,5,why somebody had done this to her house.
38,6,She said
38,7,she had paid rent for a month
38,8,and was just trying to provide for her family.
38,9,She didn't know
38,10,why this was happening.
38,11,"If they didn't want someone like her to live in the house,"
38,12,they shouldn't have rented it to her
38,13,however she wasn't going to move
38,14,as she didn't have money.
38,15,She didn’t know
38,16,what she was going to do beyond the month
38,17,"however for this month,"
38,18,she wasn't going to move
38,19,as she didn’t have money to.
38,20,She said
38,21,"if the neighbours wanted her out,"
38,22,they should collectively give her money
38,23,to move
38,24,but they didn’t.
38,25,The father became sick
38,26,"during this period,"
38,27,and the neighbour were as nice as could be
38,28,but this was their terrifying welcome
38,29,to Third and Wharton.

40,1,Why would you do this to me.
40,2,We may be a different colour
40,3,but other than that we are the same.
40,4,I am just trying to provide a home for my family.
40,5,I have paid all my money for a month's rent
40,6,so you may as well get that in head.
40,7,It is winter
40,8,and cold
40,9,and I cannot afford to buy new windows.
40,10,"Unless you all want to give me money to move,"
40,11,I will be staying for the month.
40,12,"Of course no one wanted to give money,"
40,13,they probably couldn't afford it themselves.
40,14,During our time in that house
40,15,my father became ill.
40,16,And the neighbours supported us
40,17,like they would anyone else.
41,1,"The mother stood up to the crowd,"
41,2,"telling them she was the same as them,"
41,3,just a different colour.
41,4,She said that she had paid the rent for a month
41,5,"and that she didn't have anymore money,"
41,6,certainly not to replace broken windows.
41,7,She said that would have to accept her
41,8,as the family was going to be there for a month.
41,9,She didn't know what would be happening after that month.
41,10,"She asked them to put forward some money,"
41,11,"but of course, they didn't."
41,12,When the father came back he was very sick
41,13,and then the people were as nice as they could be.
42,1,she told them
42,2,"they had rented the house,"
42,3,she told them
42,4,"how much money she had paid,"
42,5,she knew
42,6,"she was going to be there for the month,"
42,7,she didn’t know
42,8,"beyond if they could pay thereafter,"
42,9,it was winter
42,10,and cold
42,11,"could not afford buying of windows,"
42,12,she asked them
42,13,to give her enough money
42,14,to move elsewhere
42,15,"if they want her to leave,"
42,16,"because she did not have,"
42,17,her father was sick
42,18,and the neighbours were kind.
43,1,The mother turned to the group of people
43,2,and told them
43,3,"that she has paid all her money for the month to stay,"
43,4,does not know if can afford to stay longer
43,5,but will be there for that month.
43,6,Told them
43,7,she does not know who threw the stones
43,8,but she can't afford to pay for broken windows.
43,9,If they want to give her money to move somewhere else
43,10,they can.
43,11,She told them she is a different colour to them
43,12,but she is no different to them.
43,13,During the time living there after this
43,14,the child's father became sick.
43,15,The neighbours were kind to them.
44,1,The police returned the mother and boy
44,2,in the police patrol
44,3,because the lady was talking loud.
44,4,"They are in fifth street,"
44,5,all the neighbours ran out
44,6,to see what's happening
44,7,when the police clang went off.
44,8,All the people was looking at the mom
44,9,"and the mom asked them why they are looking at her,"
44,10,she knows she looks different color-wise
44,11,but all she wants to do is provide for her family.
44,12,"She rented the house,"
44,13,and paid upfront for 1 month.
44,14,She was unsure if she could afford the rented house for another month.
44,15,It was winter time
44,16,"and it was cold,"
44,17,cannot afford to buy new windows.
44,18,Mom doesn't know who threw the stones
44,19,but she knows for sure that they will live there for at least 1 month.
44,20,The mother told the people if they don't want her here
44,21,then they must give her enough money to pay for another house to rent.
44,22,The mother's dad became sick.
44,23,It was scary for them to live in that neighborhood.
45,1,"When police returned the mother and the boy home,"
45,2,the neighbors came running to see what was happening.
45,3,"And of course, they saw the man came around"
45,4,and back - I can see it right now -
45,5,from where he was sitting up front there
45,6,"where the horses came around,"
45,7,and opened the door in the back.
45,8,And they had a long door in the back
45,9,where you had to come down steps to get out the back of the -
45,10,of this police patrol.
45,11,"Well, we got out of that police patrol."
45,12,"Before the patrol ever left,"
45,13,"my mother turned and faced all those people that were standing around,"
45,14,"and she says, ""why you're doing this to me I don't know."""
45,15,"She says, ""I know that I am different from you, colour wise,"
45,16,"but in every other respect, I'm just the same as you are,"
45,17,"and all I'm trying to do is provide a home for my family."""
46,1,Once the police returned the mother and boy home
46,2,"in the police patrol,"
46,3,the whole neighborhood came out
46,4,to see the loud horses arriving.
46,5,The mother then made a speech
46,6,to all the neighbours
46,7,"about not being sure why they were doing this,"
46,8,and that despite being of a different colour
46,9,"she was the same as everybody else,"
46,10,trying to provide a home for her family.
46,11,She made it clear
46,12,they would at least be there for the month
46,13,"as they paid the rent upfront,"
46,14,and didn't have extra cash to move somewhere else.
46,15,She suggested
46,16,"that if they wanted her gone,"
46,17,they should save up the money
46,18,for her to move elsewhere with her family.
46,19,As time went on
46,20,"and the father fell sick,"
46,21,they found that the neighbours were very kind and generous.
46,22,The problems seemed to subside
46,23,but the entrance into the neighbourhood was traumatising for the boy.
47,1,The police wagon had a bell
47,2,"that made a loud clanging sound,"
47,3,so the neighbors all came out
47,4,to see what was happening
47,5,as they arrived back.
47,6,The mother jumped off the back of the police wagon
47,7,before it had even stopped
47,8,"and said to everyone in the neighborhood who had gathered around,"
47,9,"""Look,"
47,10,we live here now
47,11,so get used to it.
47,12,The only difference between me and you all is the color of my skin.
47,13,"I just moved in,"
47,14,"it cost all my money to pay this month's rent,"
47,15,so for this month we'll be here
47,16,unless you get us the money to move somewhere else!
47,17,"And we can't afford to be replacing windows,"
47,18,"we spent all our money on the rent for this house!"""
47,19,Of course no one gave them money to move somewhere else.
47,20,"But when father got sick that month,"
47,21,the neighbors were very kind and supportive.
48,1,when returning home
48,2,the father was sick
48,3,and the boy was frightened
48,4,to live there
49,1,The mother asked all the neighbors
49,2,why they were doing this to her.
49,3,She told them
49,4,her skin color may be different
49,5,but she's the same as them inside.
49,6,She told them
49,7,she was just trying to provide a home for her family
49,8,and if they wanted her to move out so bad
49,9,they needed to pay for her to move
49,10,as she has not enough money.
49,11,During the ending
49,12,the father had become sick
49,13,and the neighbors were apparently welcoming after that point.
50,1,When the police returned the mother and the boy home
50,2,they were understandably frightened
50,3,and worried about their safety.
50,4,"However, the mother made it clear"
50,5,that she had no money to move anywhere else
50,6,"and if it was such a huge problem for her neighbours,"
50,7,"them being there,"
50,8,then it's probably best
50,9,that they get together
50,10,and try to raise some money
50,11,to help get them out of the area.
50,12,She made it clear
50,13,she would be staying for a month.
51,1,once they returned home
51,2,the mother started talking to the policeman
51,3,about how she wasn't going to move anywhere
51,4,unless the community could give them enough money
51,5,to move
52,1,"They were brought home in the police car,"
52,2,"she spoke up to the neighbors,"
52,3,"explaining her situation of having paid up until the end of the month,"
52,4,and her struggles.
52,5,Her father had gotten sick.
52,6,The neighbors were nice
52,7,and defended her during that period.
53,1,The police returned the lady and the son home
53,2,in the cart
53,3,with a horse.
53,4,The cart made a distinct noise
53,5,"which the neighbourhood recognised,"
53,6,and it also had a bell.
53,7,That led to the neighbours all coming out
53,8,as they heard the cart approach.
53,9,The mother got out
53,10,"and spilled her heart,"
53,11,saying her family had spent all they had on the first month of rent
53,12,"so they would be staying for at least that long,"
53,13,and how they were only different in colour
53,14,but the same in every other respect.
53,15,Given she had no money to be fixing the broken window
53,16,so the neighbours were free to pay for that
53,17,so that she had money to move elsewhere when the month was up.
53,18,This didn't happen
53,19,but the neighbours were far more helpful
53,20,when the father was then sick.
54,1,It was a bad neighbourhood
54,2,don’t like blacks or Jews
54,3,The police couldn’t do anything
54,4,"but said they should move,"
54,5,but they couldn’t
54,6,and they couldn’t afford windows.
55,1,The police patrol arrived at their home
55,2,and all the neighbours were stood around watching.
55,3,The mother told them
55,4,"that she knew they didn't want them there,"
55,5,but that they were going to be there for at least a month
55,6,as they had paid the rent in advance.
55,7,She told them
55,8,"that she didn't have any money to move,"
55,9,so if they wanted them out
55,10,they would have to give the family the money to do so.
55,11,The mother said
55,12,"that she may be a different colour to them,"
55,13,"but that in all other respects she was just the same,"
55,14,and simply trying to provide a home for her family.
55,15,She said
55,16,"she didn't know who had broken the windows,"
55,17,but that she didn't have the money to replace them
55,18,and it was cold.
55,19,The boy recalled
55,20,"that his father became sick while they were living there,"
55,21,"and that the neighbours then could not have been more helpful,"
55,22,but that the family would always remember
55,23,that hostile welcome that was initially given to them.
56,1,"The mother said ""There's one thing that you can do""."
56,2,"The police officer asked ""what's that?"""
56,3,"The mother said ""Take us home""."
56,4,The police officer was confused
56,5,"The mother further explained ""Yes, take us home in your patrol car""."
56,6,The police officer hadn't seen a lady talk loud like that before
56,7,"So to avoid the situation,"
56,8,They put the mother and the boy in the patrol car
56,9,And took them home.
56,10,"On the way home,"
56,11,There were noises of bells from the patrol car
56,12,Which made everybody look outside their homes.
56,13,"Somebody opened the door for the mother and the boy,"
56,14,And there were long steps they had to walk out of.
56,15,"Lots of people were staring at the mother and the boy,"
56,16,"And the mother asked ""why are you all doing this to us?"""
56,17,"I know we are different colors,"
56,18,But I already rented this house.
56,19,"I paid all the money I had for the whole month,"
56,20,So I'm unable to move elsewhere.
56,21,"If you want me to leave,"
56,22,"Then you can all group together and come up with money so I can move somewhere else"""
56,23,"The neighbours didn't do that,"
56,24,They probably didn't have any money either.
56,25,"After this, the father also became sick,"
56,26,However the neighbours were really nice and helped with any problems.
56,27,That was our welcoming
56,28,And it was scary.
57,1,The mother asked the police for money
57,2,to move
57,3,"as she had spent all of it on rent,"
57,4,but the police had no money
57,5,to help.
57,6,The father had fallen ill
57,7,"and the neighbours were very helpful,"
57,8,"as neighbours should be,"
57,9,however this did not stop further aggression
57,10,from the Irish neighbourhood.
58,1,The neighbors came out to see
58,2,and the mother told them
58,3,they were here to stay for a month
58,4,because that was all they could afford.
58,5,After they helped them
58,6,and the father became sick.
59,1,They opened the patrol door
59,2,and it was a long way down
59,3,some steps on a ramp
59,4,and when we got out
59,5,we could see that everyone was gathered round.
59,6,And my mother said to everyone
59,7,that someone there must have thrown the stones at the windows.
59,8,She said that we are different from everyone
59,9,- in colour -
59,10,but that is the only difference
59,11,and we are the same as them in every other way.
59,12,She said that we are there for a month
59,13,and had already paid for the month
59,14,(and she didn't know about being there longer)
59,15,and she told them how much we had paid for the month
59,16,and she said that we aren't able to move
59,17,because we didn't have the money.
59,18,She said that she was just trying to provide for her family
59,19,and that it was going to be winter soon
59,20,and cold
59,21,and didn't have money to be fixing windows.
59,22,She said if they were not happy that we were there
59,23,then someone could give us the money to move
59,24,because we didn't have the money.
59,25,Nobody gave us the money
59,26,because I suppose they didn't have it either.
59,27,Sometime later my father returned
59,28,and he was really sick
59,29,and everyone in the neighbourhood was really nice to us
59,30,just like they'd be to anyone else
59,31,and that was my introduction to the neighbourhood
59,32,which was very frightening.
60,1,"When we arrived back to um fifth street,"
60,2,many people were there
60,3,because of the clanging of the police patrol.
60,4,My mother graduated from high school
60,5,and was well educated.
60,6,"My mother said ""Why are you doing this to us?"""
60,7,And my mother told them
60,8,that she already paid the rent of the house in advance
60,9,and that it was all she had.
60,10,"My mother said that if they want her to leave,"
60,11,then they should give her the money
60,12,that would be able to move us away.
60,13,"They obviously didn't do that,"
60,14,they also probably didn't have the money for that either.
60,15,"After a while,"
60,16,dad got sick to do work
60,17,and the neighbours helped us out.
60,18,This was a terrible welcome to the neighbourhood.
61,1,She went to Fifth Street
61,2,where they were grouped together.
61,3,She said
61,4,"they were just like her,"
61,5,and has the same struggles as her.
61,6,They were no different.
61,7,She said
61,8,that she is there
61,9,for at least a month
61,10,because rent took all her money.
61,11,And to the window breaker
61,12,that it is winter
61,13,and she can’t afford new windows
61,14,cause she is broke
61,15,so please don’t break more windows.
61,16,If they really wanted her gone
61,17,than they can pool enough money
61,18,so she can rent a different place.
61,19,They didn’t react
61,20,but left her alone.
61,21,"Overtime her neighbor was kind to them,"
61,22,and even help them
61,23,when her dad got sick.
62,1,"The mother and the boy were in a police patrol,"
62,2,"going back home,"
62,3,the home was fifth street away from the police station.
62,4,"When they arrived,"
62,5,there was a crowd of the neighbourhood
62,6,"and the mother told them that she had nowhere else to go,"
62,7,they had to deal with her staying there with her family
62,8,because she had already paid rent.
62,9,She would move
62,10,"if they would give her back the money,"
62,11,most of the people who lived there were Irish
62,12,and the mother and her family were black.
62,13,"After she told them that they had to accept her and her family,"
62,14,they became welcoming
62,15,and helped them when the father got sick.
63,1,And we got out the police car
63,2,and all the people were standing there
63,3,"and my mother said ""why you are doing this to me I don't know."
63,4,But we live here now
63,5,and have paid rent for the month
63,6,and don't have no more money left to move
63,7,"so if you want us to move you can give us the money"""
63,8,But of course no one did
63,9,and then when my father got sick
63,10,the neighbours were nice
63,11,and treated us the same as anyone else.
64,1,All the neighbors came out onto the street
64,2,"because they heard police sirens,"
64,3,"they saw it was the black family,"
64,4,before the family went inside
64,5,the mother gave a huge speech
64,6,"on how she has no money to move,"
64,7,how she's there for a month
64,8,then doesn't know if she can afford longer
64,9,she said if they want her and her family to leave
64,10,"to pay the money to help her move,"
64,11,she also explained that she is just the same as them.
64,12,Then her husband got sick
64,13,and all the neighbors helped.
65,1,There was a clang clang clang
65,2,with the bell.
65,3,All the neighbours came out
65,4,to see what was going on.
65,5,"There was a long door on the police patrol then,"
65,6,and the policeman had to come
65,7,and let the mother out.
65,8,"The rent had been paid for a month,"
65,9,so they knew
65,10,they would be able to stay for the month.
65,11,"Whether they would be able to pay the rent for another month,"
65,12,"they didn't know,"
65,13,but they knew
65,14,they would be there for the month.
65,15,"Then during this period,"
65,16,the father got sick
65,17,and all the neighbours helped
65,18,and were friendly as anything.
65,19,And that's how
65,20,the first experience of living there went.
66,1,"When the patrol car stopped,"
66,2,the police officer in the front got out
66,3,and came round the vehicle
66,4,to let the son and mother out.
66,5,"There were neighbours standing around watching,"
66,6,so the mother decided to address them all
66,7,by telling them that she knew one of them threw the rock through her window
66,8,and that she and the family cannot afford to move for the month.
66,9,"She said that if they wanted her and her family to leave,"
66,10,they need to get together the money for her to move.
66,11,They didn't.
66,12,"But after the confrontation/explanation,"
66,13,they did seem to treat the family better
66,14,and were nicer to them overall.
66,15,Though the boy did say
66,16,that the first impression/rock incident did really terrify him at the time.
67,1,"When they returned home,"
67,2,she showed them the damage
67,3,but the police did not care
67,4,and the mother was concerned
67,5,as she would not be able to pay for the window
67,6,and it was coming into winter.
67,7,The neighbours took pity on them
67,8,after their father died
67,9,"and became more helpful towards the family,"
67,10,taking pity on them.
67,11,They moved into a communal place with neighbours
67,12,and although they were unfriendly at first
67,13,they took pity
67,14,once the father of the young people died.
68,1,The mother and the boy returned home
68,2,and the mother was talking with the police
68,3,about who the likely troublemakers were.
68,4,The Police said
68,5,they could not help find
68,6,who was victimizing the boy's family.
68,7,They suspected
68,8,it was Irish gangs.
69,1,"After the police returned the mother and the boy home in the police wagon,"
69,2,a crowd of neighbors gathered to watch.
69,3,"The mother confronted them,"
69,4,saying she didn't understand
69,5,why they were hostile.
69,6,She acknowledged their differences in skin color
69,7,but emphasized that she was just trying to provide for her family.
69,8,"She explained that they had rented the house,"
69,9,"paid a month's rent,"
69,10,and had no money to move.
69,11,"She told the crowd that if they wanted her to leave,"
69,12,"they would need to raise the money for her to relocate,"
69,13,as she couldn't afford to replace broken windows or move.
69,14,"The neighbours did not offer any money,"
69,15,and the family stayed.
69,16,"Although their initial reception was hostile and frightening,"
69,17,"with time,"
69,18,"the neighbours became kinder,"
69,19,especially when the father fell ill.
69,20,"Despite this eventual goodwill,"
69,21,the speaker recalls the fear and tension
69,22,of their difficult introduction to the neighbourhood.
70,1,The police took them home
70,2,in the police car.
70,3,The mother got out
70,4,and told the crowd
70,5,who would have included the person who threw the stones
70,6,"that broke the windows,"
70,7,that she couldn't afford to move.
70,8,She told them
70,9,that she would be here for the month
70,10,"and if they wanted her to go,"
70,11,then they would need to give her the money to leave
70,12,as she didn't have any.
70,13,She said she had a family
70,14,"and couldn't afford to keep paying for windows to be fixed,"
70,15,so they needed to stop breaking them.
70,16,It seemed like the people were then ok with the family
70,17,"as when the husband got ill,"
70,18,they were nice to the family.
71,1,The police were returning the mother and the boy back to their home
71,2,in a horse drawn wagon.
71,3,The cart had a large bell on it
71,4,that let off a loud 'clang' sound as they went.
71,5,The noise from the bell caused a lot of people from the neighbourhood to come out
71,6,into the street
71,7,to see what was going on.
71,8,When they got home
71,9,the mother addressed the crowd of neighbours
71,10,before the police wagon had the opportunity to leave.
71,11,She told them
71,12,"that aside from the colour of their skin,"
71,13,her family was just the same as theirs.
71,14,"She said that she had rented the house,"
71,15,"that she had paid for a month up front,"
71,16,and that she had no more money
71,17,to move.
71,18,"She said that even though it was cold,"
71,19,"she had no more money to fix the windows,"
71,20,"and that if they truly didn't want her and her family to live there,"
71,21,they could give her enough money
71,22,"to move somewhere else,"
71,23,because otherwise
71,24,they would be there at least for the month.
71,25,The boy recounted
71,26,"that after that day,"
71,27,"for the duration of their tenancy,"
71,28,"the neighbours were nice to their family,"
71,29,including when his father got sick.
72,1,The mother said
72,2,that her and her family was staying for a month
72,3,and if the people in the neighborhood didn't like her and her family moving to the town
72,4,the people who don’t want them there should give them money to move away
72,5,but that was said with the knowledge
72,6,that the people who threw the rocks in the first place don't have money themselves.
72,7,It is going into winter
72,8,and the family cannot afford new windows
72,9,and it will be cold.
72,10,It was a frightening time for the boy
72,11,to be introduced to the neighborhood.
74,1,The mother was really upset
74,2,and distressed
74,3,as it's winter
74,4,and she can't afford new windows
74,5,"as someone stoned them,"
74,6,police could not do anything
74,7,as the woman didn't know any names
74,8,of the people who stoned their windows.
75,1,i was 10 years old
75,2,and lived on 4th street
75,3,they got out of the police wagons
75,4,& the neighbours all came out to see what was going on
75,5,the clanging bell of the wagon had alerted them
75,6,she asked the neighbours why are you doing this to me
75,7,if you want us to move
75,8,you can give me money
75,9,because i have paid 1 month in advance
75,10,& have no other money
75,11,it was winter
75,12,& we could not afford new windows
75,13,dad got ill
75,14,& the neighbours rallied round
75,15,& helped us out
76,1,They were driven home
76,2,in a patrol cart
76,3,with a door at the back.
76,4,"As they emerged from the cart,"
76,5,"the neighbours were gathering round,"
76,6,having been alerted by the noise.
76,7,The mother took the opportunity
76,8,"to address the gathering,"
76,9,saying that she knew
76,10,that the stoning incident had occurred
76,11,because she and her family were black.
76,12,She said she felt
76,13,that the landlord shouldn't have rented the house to her
76,14,in the first place
76,15,if this was the reaction they were going to get.
76,16,But they were here now
76,17,"for at least the next month,"
76,18,and they couldn't afford to move
76,19,because the move had used up all their savings.
76,20,She suggested
76,21,"that if the neighbours really wanted them out,"
76,22,they should club together
76,23,and pay for a move somewhere else.
76,24,She also said
76,25,that the only difference between them was skin colour
76,26,"- in all other respects,"
76,27,they were basically the same.
76,28,"After this,"
76,29,the neighbours treated them well
76,30,and were very helpful.
77,1,They pulled up outside the house
77,2,and the waggon was clanging
77,3,so the neighbours came out to look.
77,4,Mum and son went down steps
77,5,out of the tall door
77,6,at the back of the waggon
77,7,and mum addressed the onlookers
77,8,and said
77,9,that like it or not
77,10,she and her family are staying here for another month
77,11,so if the neighbours don't like it
77,12,"they can all pay toward finding the family somewhere else to live,"
77,13,but no-one responded
77,14,and no one wanted to pay for the windows.
77,15,It seems like the family stayed
77,16,because some time later the dad of the family got ill
77,17,and the neighbours were nice about it.
78,1,"When the police returned the mother and the boy home,"
78,2,"somewhere on Fifth Street,"
78,3,"the clang clang clang sound from the Police patrol alarmed everybody in the neighborhood,"
78,4,which made them come around.
78,5,The man in the police patrol came out
78,6,and also opened the door for the boy and his mother
78,7,to make their way out of the Police Patrol.
78,8,The mother then questioned the neighbors
78,9,"why they behaved in that manner towards her,"
78,10,asking them if they behaved liked that because she was black.
78,11,"She said if they did not want her in the neighborhood,"
78,12,then the house shouldn't have been rented to her in the first place
78,13,and that it was the fault of the Real Estate Agency.
78,14,So then she asked the people to gather some money
78,15,"and give to her,"
78,16,so that she can go rent another house somewhere else
78,17,"because it was winter,"
78,18,and she couldn't afford to fix windows and rent another place.
78,19,This is because she had used all the money she had to rent the house.
78,20,The people in the neighborhood clearly did not have any money to give to her.
78,21,"During that time, the boy's dad was sick."
78,22,"They couldn't go back to the place,"
78,23,and that was how they were welcomed into the new neighborhood on Fifth Street.
78,24,It was a very frightening experience for the boy.
79,1,The police took the mom and boy home
79,2,"in the police patrol,"
79,3,"which made a clang, clang, clang sound,"
79,4,similar to the clang of a trolley.
79,5,"The patrol was long,"
79,6,with a door at the back.
79,7,"When they reached home,"
79,8,a crowd was gathered.
79,9,"The man, the police officer, climbed off his horse,"
79,10,"went to the back of the patrol,"
79,11,and opened the door for us.
79,12,"My mother addressed the crowd,"
79,13,saying she didn't know why they'd stoned the house
79,14,and broken the window.
79,15,She said they'd used all the money they had
79,16,"to pay for one month's rent,"
79,17,"and unless the people gathered wanted to pay for the family to move,"
79,18,they would be staying for the month.
79,19,"After that, she didn't know what would happen."
79,20,She said they were no different than anyone else here.
79,21,"During the following month, the boy's father was ill,"
79,22,"and the neighbours treated the family with kindness,"
79,23,"helping them with food, etc."
79,24,That was the family's experience
79,25,"during the month of living in this place,"
79,26,"a Black family in an Irish neighbourhood,"
79,27,dealing with Irish police.
80,1,And they came down from the long door at the back of the police patrol down the steps.
80,2,"And the mother said ""I may be different from you people colour wise, but I am the same in every other aspect""."
80,3,She claimed what she had paid for the rent
80,4,and that they would be there for at least the next month
80,5,and that it being winter time she didn't have the money to keep buying windows.
80,6,If they wanted her and her family to move they could all come up with the money for her to do so as she did not have it.
80,7,"They didn't do that,"
80,8,they likely didn't have nay money either.
80,9,In that next month the father became sick.
80,10,The neighbours were as nice as anybody.
80,11,That was their welcome to the neighbourhood
80,12,and it was terrible.
81,1,The mother insisted that the police escort her and her son back home
81,2,on Third and Wharton via the police cart and horse.
81,3,The police cart had a bell
81,4,"which was rung,"
81,5,making a loud clanging noise
81,6,"that attracted the neighbourhood,"
81,7,who all came out to see what was going on.
81,8,"As the mother got out of the vehicle,"
81,9,she defiantly addressed the crowd.
81,10,"She stated that although the colour of her skin was different,"
81,11,she was just the same as the people living in the neighbourhood.
81,12,"She simply wanted to provide a home for her family,"
81,13,and that she had given all of her money to pay for the rent for one month.
81,14,"This meant that she would not be going anywhere for the next month,"
81,15,and she was working hard to earn more money
81,16,as she was unsure if she would have enough to continue paying the rent.
81,17,She then referred to the accident
81,18,when there was a group of people
81,19,"who were throwing stones through the window,"
81,20,which scared the boy and the siblings.
81,21,"After the incident,"
81,22,the boy's father got sick
81,23,"and the neighbourhood rallied around the family,"
81,24,"offering to provide help where they could,"
81,25,and to stop any troublemakers causing harm to the family.
81,26,The boy refers to the first time that they moved to the area
81,27,as a terrifying and frightening time.
82,1,"**In this episode**,"
82,2,**a family is taken home**
82,3,**by a police patrol**
82,4,**after a troubling incident**.
82,5,**The narrator vividly describes**
82,6,**the sound of the patrol’s bell—“clang clang clang”**
82,7,**as it approaches**.
82,8,"**Neighbors gather**,"
82,9,**curious about the commotion**.
82,10,"**The mother bravely confronts the crowd**,"
82,11,**expressing her frustration**
82,12,**and asserting her humanity**
82,13,**despite their racial differences**.
82,14,**She explains that she's rented the house**
82,15,"**for a month**,"
82,16,**emphasizing her struggle**
82,17,**to provide for her family**
82,18,"**during the cold winter**,"
82,19,**and challenges the neighbors to help**
82,20,**if they don't want her there**.
82,21,"**Her determination shines through**,"
82,22,**highlighting both vulnerability**
82,23,**and resilience in the face of prejudice**.
83,1,The mother told the people
83,2,that they had no money
83,3,so they could not leave
83,4,as they had paid a month
83,5,and if they wanted them to leave
83,6,they would need to give them money
83,7,which they did not have
83,8,then the father became sick
83,9,and the community rallied around
83,10,and helped
84,1,(I) do not remember
85,1,They climbed out of the police patrol
85,2,and the mother turned to those standing there
85,3,and said she didn't know
85,4,why they were doing what they did.
85,5,She said she knew she was different in color
85,6,"but said besides that,"
85,7,they were actually the same.
85,8,She said the house they lived in was rented out
85,9,and told them the price for & that was all she had
85,10,so the family would stay there.
85,11,"She told them if they did not like it,"
85,12,they could come together
85,13,and give her the money for her to move
85,14,as she did not have any.
85,15,The community did not give her any money
85,16,and they stayed.
85,17,The dad got sick
85,18,and the community members were now nice & friendly to them
85,19,and eventually were treated as part of the Irish community.
86,1,The mother got out of the police vehicle
86,2,and loudly stated to the neighbourhood
86,3,that they were staying put in the house
86,4,"for (at least) the next month,"
86,5,being that was the period of time
86,6,that the rent (paid in advance) would cover.
86,7,The mother then said
86,8,that she did not have the money
86,9,for window replacements
86,10,that were damaged by the stones.
86,11,The mother challenged the neighbours
86,12,"that if they wanted the family out of the house,"
86,13,they would need to pay them to leave
86,14,as they had no money.
86,15,It turned out
86,16,that the neighbours probably also did not have money.
86,17,"Eventually the family settled nicely in the house,"
86,18,"and the neighbours were the ""nicest neighbours ever""."
87,1,The mother said to the police
87,2,that they don't know why
87,3,"they're doing this to her,"
87,4,"all because she's different to them colour-wise,"
87,5,that she just wanted to be able to provide for her family.
87,6,The boy then mentioned
87,7,"that they stayed there for the meantime,"
87,8,and while they were staying there
87,9,"his father got sick,"
87,10,and it was a very sad time for him.
88,1,"They went in a horse drawn carriage,"
88,2,"which had a bell,"
88,3,"which went clang, clang, clang."
88,4,"All the neighbors noticed,"
88,5,and came out.
88,6,This was a black family
88,7,in a neighborhood that didn't seem to want to accept them.
88,8,The mother of the house then addressed the neighbors
88,9,"when they got back,"
88,10,"and told them that they were staying for at least a month,"
88,11,"and if they didn't like that,"
88,12,"then they could pay up to allow them to move elsewhere,"
88,13,"but no one did that,"
88,14,as they didn't have the money.
88,15,"Something changed,"
88,16,"and the neighbors then started to accept them,"
88,17,when the father became ill.
89,1,The woman asked the police
89,2,to take her home
89,3,via a police patrol van
89,4,because she was talking loud.
89,5,The police patrol had a bell
89,6,that clanged
89,7,[and] people came looking.
89,8,[She] got out
89,9,and looked at the people
89,10,and they were looking at her
89,11,because of her colour.
89,12,She didn’t have any money
89,13,to pay rent
89,14,for after a month
89,15,or for fixing the house.
89,16,She asked for enough money
89,17,to leave her house
89,18,so [that] people can help her.
90,1,The police patrol rolled up to the house
90,2,and all the neighbours had come running
90,3,"due to the Clang, Clang, Clang of the bell on the police patrol."
90,4,The boy and his mother stepped down from the back of the patrol
90,5,when it stopped
90,6,and the mother addressed the crowd of people assembled.
90,7,She said that she was different colour wise
90,8,but in all other respects was the same.
90,9,She said that she did not know whom had thrown the stones.
90,10,She explained that she had rented the property for a month
90,11,and that the rent had consumed all the money that she had
90,12,and therefore she could not afford to leave
90,13,and so was going to be there for a month
90,14,unless the people would give her money to allow her to move.
90,15,Of course this did not happen.
90,16,When the father returned home he became sick
90,17,and the neighbours were as nice as pie to them
90,18,but what had happened as their first introduction to the neighbourhood had frightened and traumatised the boy
90,19,so that he would always remember it as an awful and scary time.
91,1,The mother wondered
91,2,why she was allowed to rent
91,3,in the first place
91,4,if they didn't want her there.
91,5,She told them
91,6,the windows would need to be replaced
91,7,since it's cold.
91,8,She told them
91,9,they would have to come up with the money together
91,10,if they wanted her to move
91,11,since she had none.
91,12,They also had none
91,13,so they let her live in peace.
92,1,They stopped
92,2,and it was a long door they opened
92,3,and the mum told them
92,4,she was oh different in color
92,5,but the same otherwise
92,6,and that she only had the money she had paid for the month
92,7,and if people wanted her to move
92,8,they had to give her the money
92,9,so she could get somewhere else.
92,10,"The person's dad became sick in that time,"
92,11,neighbors were very nice.
92,12,But the welcoming had been awful
92,13,and very frightening.
92,14,Ok I’m in max.
93,1,"After the mother and the boy were returned home,"
93,2,the mother saw all the neighbors standing there watching her.
93,3,She told them all how much she had paid in rent for the month
93,4,and told them that they were at least staying there a month.
93,5,She said she didn’t know if they would have enough money to live there next month.
93,6,"If the neighbors didn’t want her living there,"
93,7,"then they could give her enough money to move again,"
93,8,but none of them gave her any money.
93,9,"It was during this time that the father got sick,"
93,10,"however,"
93,11,the neighbors where is nice has anyone else would be.
94,1,When police returned the mother and boy home
94,2,home in convoy
94,3,They talked with the neighbors
94,4,and told them
94,5,that they do not have enough money to move out
94,6,and how much money (was) spent renting this house
94,7,If neighbors want them to move
94,8,then gather some money
94,9,and give it to mother and boy
94,10,so that they can move out
94,11,Eventually everything settled up
94,12,Boy's father became ill
94,13,and neighbors were supporting.
95,1,"When they returned home,"
95,2,the people got out their houses
95,3,"to see what was going on,"
95,4,"and when the mother got off the carriage,"
95,5,she said out loud
95,6,"so they can all hear ""why you're doing this to me I don't know,"
95,7,and I don't have money to move out
95,8,"because I just moved here,"
95,9,"so if you don't want me here,"
95,10,"you can all put money together to help me move to another place,"
95,11,and I don't have the money to buy new windows
95,12,"that you just broke"""
95,13,They didn't give her the money
95,14,because they also did not have the money.
95,15,"They stayed there for a while,"
95,16,"and the father fell ill,"
95,17,and the neighbors were nice.
96,1,The mother berated them
96,2,saying she was the same for them
96,3,trying to provide for her family
96,4,and couldn't afford to move.
96,5,If they wanted her to move
96,6,they would have to give her money
96,7,because she could afford it.
96,8,The neighbours were nice
96,9,when the father became ill.
97,1,"After the police returned the mother and the boy home,"
97,2,as the mother got out the police patrol
97,3,"and everyone came out to see what was happening due to the clang of the bell,"
97,4,she explained that she had paid rent for a month.
97,5,"Therefore, she was going to stay there for that month"
97,6,and did not know if she would have enough money to stay longer.
97,7,She mentioned it was winter
97,8,and could not afford to fix the window
97,9,and would have to let the cold enter her house.
97,10,She asked for whoever broke it to fix it
97,11,but no one did.
97,12,"She also explained that besides her color, she was no different from the people who lived there."
97,13,"She also said if they did not want her there,"
97,14,they should come together and pitch in with money
97,15,so that she could afford to rent another house in a different place
97,16,but that also did not happen.
97,17,The little boy said that the whole situation scared him.
98,1,The neighbours heard the bell
98,2,and [heard] horses of the police
98,3,as they approached the mother’s house.
98,4,The mother addressed the neighbours
98,5,"by saying why have they done this to her,"
98,6,"because apart from her colour they were the same,"
98,7,just trying to provide a home for her family.
98,8,She explained that they paid a month's rent for this house
98,9,and [explained that] if they wanted her to move
98,10,"they would have to pay her some money,"
98,11,so she could do that.
98,12,"She said that she didn't have any money to move,"
98,13,so they would have to stay there.
98,14,Her husband who was a drinker
98,15,became sick
98,16,and the neighbours were nice
98,17,and [neighbours] helped them.
98,18,[I am] Too [sic] be honest rather confused with the timeline
98,19,as to when that happened!
99,1,The police took them home
99,2,and the mother confronted the neighbors.
99,3,She told them
99,4,that they could either raise enough money for them to move
99,5,or leave them alone.
99,6,By standing up to them
99,7,she gained their respect
99,8,and they became supportive of the family.
