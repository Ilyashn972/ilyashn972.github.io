The worker was working late and began to feel strange. Was it because the worker had not eaten anything that day? The feelings of unease increased and the worker began to feel a tightening in the chest and could feel their heart pounding. They also got a headache and began to feel dizzy. Sweat began to pour down their face and arms and he/she leaned against a wall. The manager noticed the problem and called out, but the worker was unable to speak. Another colleague had seen the worker's distress and had alerted the manager. The manager helped the worker to a staff room where the worker got a glass of water. The symptoms of tightness eased and the worker recovered. The cause of the distress was a panic attack which the worker thought had come about because of lack of food. Worker resolves to take better care in future."
