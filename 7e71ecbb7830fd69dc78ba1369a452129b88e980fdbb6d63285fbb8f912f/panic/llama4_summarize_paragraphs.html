  <p>Well, I was at work one day and I was doing my usual job - working on the warehouse floor, stocking boxes and organizing merchandise. I had been working for a few hours and it was getting late. I had been feeling a bit strange, a bit lightheaded, but chalked it up to hunger and not having eaten yet that day.</p>

  <p>But then, as I was walking around the warehouse returning items to their proper places, I started to feel a strange tightness and pressure in my chest. I stopped what I was doing and leaned against a nearby wall for a bit, but the pressure only got stronger. And I could feel my heart pounding in my chest.</p>

  <p>Suddenly I heard a voice coming from across the warehouse. It was the manager, who had seen me and called out to me - it seems someone had noticed me and was checking to see if I was alright. I tried to yell back that something was wrong, but I couldn't find my voice.</p>
