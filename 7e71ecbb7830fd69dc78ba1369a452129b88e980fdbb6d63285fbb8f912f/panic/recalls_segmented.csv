5c5c88c76a946500015a31cb,19,I found out that I was having a panic attack
5c5c88c76a946500015a31cb,20,and this made me realise how important it is to check in with myself
5c5c88c76a946500015a31cb,21,and to eat well to avoid any more episodes.
602886066965e376bd5f7ebe,1,It started one day
602886066965e376bd5f7ebe,2,while I was working in the warehouse.
602886066965e376bd5f7ebe,3,I was stocking and organizing boxes.
602886066965e376bd5f7ebe,4,I started to feel light-headed.
602886066965e376bd5f7ebe,5,I felt a tightening in my chest.
602886066965e376bd5f7ebe,6,I leaned against a wall.
602886066965e376bd5f7ebe,7,The manager called out
602886066965e376bd5f7ebe,8,asking if I was okay.
602886066965e376bd5f7ebe,9,A co-worker had seen me
602886066965e376bd5f7ebe,10,and notified him.
602886066965e376bd5f7ebe,11,Sweat trickled down my head and arms.
602886066965e376bd5f7ebe,12,My manager led me to a chair
602886066965e376bd5f7ebe,13,and got me a cold glass of water.
602886066965e376bd5f7ebe,14,Soon the feeling subsided
602886066965e376bd5f7ebe,15,and I realized I had had a panic attack.
602886066965e376bd5f7ebe,16,Things could have been much worse.
602886066965e376bd5f7ebe,17,It was a wake up call for me
602886066965e376bd5f7ebe,18,to take better care of myself
602886066965e376bd5f7ebe,19,and to be able to read the signs
602886066965e376bd5f7ebe,20,when something is not right.
5ea1e178ff3ee50d69b46324,1,"It was a normal day at work,"
5ea1e178ff3ee50d69b46324,2,doing my normal tasks.
5ea1e178ff3ee50d69b46324,3,I was in the warehouse stocking the shelfs with merchandise
5ea1e178ff3ee50d69b46324,4,when i suddenly started to feel unwell.
5ea1e178ff3ee50d69b46324,5,I was lightheaded
5ea1e178ff3ee50d69b46324,6,and my chest was getting tight.
5ea1e178ff3ee50d69b46324,7,I chalked it up to not having eaten yet that day.
5ea1e178ff3ee50d69b46324,8,My manager was able to catch me before I fainted
5ea1e178ff3ee50d69b46324,9,and took me into the staff room
5ea1e178ff3ee50d69b46324,10,where I rested
5ea1e178ff3ee50d69b46324,11,and had something to eat.
5ea1e178ff3ee50d69b46324,12,Turns out I'd had a panic attack.
5ea1e178ff3ee50d69b46324,13,It was never an enjoyable experience
5ea1e178ff3ee50d69b46324,14,and it taught me to rest
5ea1e178ff3ee50d69b46324,15,and eat well
5ea1e178ff3ee50d69b46324,16,to avoid having a repeat attack.
5ee1da7a1d622e2092c1b056,1,"The story was about a man working in a warehouse doing his usual job of stacking boxes,"
5ee1da7a1d622e2092c1b056,2,when he suddenly felt a pain in his chest.
5ee1da7a1d622e2092c1b056,3,"He tried to take deep breaths and rest against a wall,"
5ee1da7a1d622e2092c1b056,4,but the pain only got worse
5ee1da7a1d622e2092c1b056,5,and he began to sweat
5ee1da7a1d622e2092c1b056,6,and see spots in his vision.
5ee1da7a1d622e2092c1b056,7,"His manager noticed and called out to him,"
5ee1da7a1d622e2092c1b056,8,but he couldn't answer
5ee1da7a1d622e2092c1b056,9,"and almost fell to the ground,"
5ee1da7a1d622e2092c1b056,10,but his manager helped him in time.
5ee1da7a1d622e2092c1b056,11,The manager took him to the staff room
5ee1da7a1d622e2092c1b056,12,"and the man rested,"
5ee1da7a1d622e2092c1b056,13,eventually learning he had experienced a panic attack.
5fe3b63f4b3bdc08088f6ae0,1,"A guy that works at a warehouse was putting up boxes and doing his job as usual,"
5fe3b63f4b3bdc08088f6ae0,2,but he suddenly realized that he was feeling a little lightheaded
5fe3b63f4b3bdc08088f6ae0,3,and he drew the conclusion that it was probably because he hadn't eaten or drank anything for a long time.
5fe3b63f4b3bdc08088f6ae0,4,"He continued with his work until he started feeling some sort of pressure in his chest area,"
5fe3b63f4b3bdc08088f6ae0,5,he leaned against the wall for a bit hoping it would ease the pressure
5fe3b63f4b3bdc08088f6ae0,6,"but it only kept getting worse,"
5fe3b63f4b3bdc08088f6ae0,7,suddenly his forehead and arms start sweating
5fe3b63f4b3bdc08088f6ae0,8,and he starts fearing for his life because he has no idea what to do.
5fe3b63f4b3bdc08088f6ae0,9,"From the distance, he can see his manager calling out to him to see if he is doing alright,"
5fe3b63f4b3bdc08088f6ae0,10,but when he tries to respond he can't seem to find his voice to utter even a single word.
5fe3b63f4b3bdc08088f6ae0,11,The manager starts to approach the warehouse worker
5fe3b63f4b3bdc08088f6ae0,12,and catches him just in time before he collapses to the ground.
5fe3b63f4b3bdc08088f6ae0,13,The manager carried him all the way to his office
5fe3b63f4b3bdc08088f6ae0,14,where he starts to ask the worker some questions
5fe3b63f4b3bdc08088f6ae0,15,"and hands him a glass of water,"
5fe3b63f4b3bdc08088f6ae0,16,that's when the worker realized he had a panic attack
5fe3b63f4b3bdc08088f6ae0,17,"and how bad it could've been,"
5fe3b63f4b3bdc08088f6ae0,18,since that day onwards he decides to really make sure he is feeding himself well
5fe3b63f4b3bdc08088f6ae0,19,and taking care of himself in general to avoid a future episode.
63d513e0fda5da3f67c745dd,1,I was at work stocking shelves.
63d513e0fda5da3f67c745dd,2,I started to feel a bit unwell
63d513e0fda5da3f67c745dd,3,and first thought it was because I hadn’t eaten for a while.
63d513e0fda5da3f67c745dd,4,My chest felt tight
63d513e0fda5da3f67c745dd,5,"and my arm,"
63d513e0fda5da3f67c745dd,6,I was sweating.
63d513e0fda5da3f67c745dd,7,Suddenly things went dark
63d513e0fda5da3f67c745dd,8,"but before I fell to the floor,"
63d513e0fda5da3f67c745dd,9,I heard someone calling across the warehouse.
63d513e0fda5da3f67c745dd,10,It was my manager asking if I was ok.
63d513e0fda5da3f67c745dd,11,I told him what had happened
63d513e0fda5da3f67c745dd,12,and he gave me a drink of cold water
63d513e0fda5da3f67c745dd,13,and told me to rest for a while.
63d513e0fda5da3f67c745dd,14,After a few minutes of rest the tightness in my chest eased
63d513e0fda5da3f67c745dd,15,and I started to feel better.
63d513e0fda5da3f67c745dd,16,It turned out that I had had a panic attack
63d513e0fda5da3f67c745dd,17,which could have been much worse if my manager hadn’t intervened.
63d513e0fda5da3f67c745dd,18,The whole episode made me realise that I need to look after myself better
63d513e0fda5da3f67c745dd,19,by eating properly
63d513e0fda5da3f67c745dd,20,and through self care.
5bb6faf4f6d0bd00019e12f4,1,The narrator was in a warehouse 'stocking' boxes
5bb6faf4f6d0bd00019e12f4,2,(I think they meant 'stacking')
5bb6faf4f6d0bd00019e12f4,3,and doing another task which I cannot recall.
5bb6faf4f6d0bd00019e12f4,4,"They felt pressure in their chest,"
5bb6faf4f6d0bd00019e12f4,5,and leaned against a wall to alleviate it.
5bb6faf4f6d0bd00019e12f4,6,"But it did not go away,"
5bb6faf4f6d0bd00019e12f4,7,"it felt worse,"
5bb6faf4f6d0bd00019e12f4,8,and their heart began pounding.
5bb6faf4f6d0bd00019e12f4,9,Their manager called out to them.
5bb6faf4f6d0bd00019e12f4,10,It appears a colleague noticed the narrator's predicament
5bb6faf4f6d0bd00019e12f4,11,and got the manager for help.
5bb6faf4f6d0bd00019e12f4,12,The manager grabbed the narrator just as their legs gave out from under them.

5f155b98b1393b000d6bf745,12,and now look after myself better.
614f68f720e1cb34cef9a1a9,1,"Well, I was at work one day,"
614f68f720e1cb34cef9a1a9,2,doing my usual job;
614f68f720e1cb34cef9a1a9,3,stacking boxes and organizing shelves.
614f68f720e1cb34cef9a1a9,4,I started to feel dizzy and light-headed
614f68f720e1cb34cef9a1a9,5,and my chest felt heavy.
614f68f720e1cb34cef9a1a9,6,At first I thought it was because I was tired and hungry.
614f68f720e1cb34cef9a1a9,7,It started to get worse
614f68f720e1cb34cef9a1a9,8,and I stopped doing what I was doing
614f68f720e1cb34cef9a1a9,9,and leaned against a shelf.
614f68f720e1cb34cef9a1a9,10,I started to see spots
614f68f720e1cb34cef9a1a9,11,and felt sweat dripping down my forehead.
614f68f720e1cb34cef9a1a9,12,"I tried to take big breaths,"
614f68f720e1cb34cef9a1a9,13,but I just couldn't catch my breath.
614f68f720e1cb34cef9a1a9,14,My manager saw me from across the warehouse floor
614f68f720e1cb34cef9a1a9,15,and called out to see if I was alright.
614f68f720e1cb34cef9a1a9,16,"Apparently, someone was watching me"
614f68f720e1cb34cef9a1a9,17,and was checking to see if I was okay.
614f68f720e1cb34cef9a1a9,18,I felt my world start to go dark
614f68f720e1cb34cef9a1a9,19,and my legs started to give way.
614f68f720e1cb34cef9a1a9,20,"Luckily, my manager got to me"
614f68f720e1cb34cef9a1a9,21,and caught me before I hit the floor.
614f68f720e1cb34cef9a1a9,22,He took me to the staff room
614f68f720e1cb34cef9a1a9,23,and got me a glass of cold water.
614f68f720e1cb34cef9a1a9,24,"After a few minutes, my chest felt better."
614f68f720e1cb34cef9a1a9,25,It turns out I had been having a panic attack.
614f68f720e1cb34cef9a1a9,26,"It was never pleasant,"
614f68f720e1cb34cef9a1a9,27,but it could have been a lot worse.
614f68f720e1cb34cef9a1a9,28,This taught me to make sure I drink enough water
614f68f720e1cb34cef9a1a9,29,and get enough rest
614f68f720e1cb34cef9a1a9,30,to ensure this doesn't happen again.
5c360ede943bda0001db4f1b,1,"The man was working doing his usual tasks around the warehouse,"
5c360ede943bda0001db4f1b,2,"he wasn't feeling good,"
5c360ede943bda0001db4f1b,3,he had a headache
5c360ede943bda0001db4f1b,4,but he thought it was caused by the fact that he hadn't eaten in a lot time.
5c360ede943bda0001db4f1b,5,"Suddenly he started to feel a strong pressure on his chest,"
5c360ede943bda0001db4f1b,6,he couldn't breath.
5c360ede943bda0001db4f1b,7,"He heard a voice calling him from the other side of the warehouse,"
5c360ede943bda0001db4f1b,8,"it was his manager checking if he was ok,"
5c360ede943bda0001db4f1b,9,but he couldn't respond since his voice wouldn't come out.
5c360ede943bda0001db4f1b,10,He almost passed out
5c360ede943bda0001db4f1b,11,but the manager reached to him before he fell to the ground.
5c360ede943bda0001db4f1b,12,"The manager took him to his office,"
5c360ede943bda0001db4f1b,13,gave him a glass of water
5c360ede943bda0001db4f1b,14,and told him to rest.
5c360ede943bda0001db4f1b,15,He then realized he had had a panic attack.

629750cb139217e17938e260,4,and I had to stop and lean against a wall.

629750cb139217e17938e260,8,and I had a cold glass of water.
629750cb139217e17938e260,9,After a few minutes

629750cb139217e17938e260,11,it was a panic attack
629750cb139217e17938e260,12,and my manager really helped me.

5cc7050c3c503e001aa6249f,2,I suddenly felt a tightness in my chest and had to stop.
5cc7050c3c503e001aa6249f,3,My vision started getting spotty and I was about to collapse.
5cc7050c3c503e001aa6249f,4,My coworker saw me in trouble and alerted my manager.
5cc7050c3c503e001aa6249f,5,My manager took me to the staff room and got me a glass of cold water.
5cc7050c3c503e001aa6249f,6,After a while I learned that it was due to a panic attack.
5cc7050c3c503e001aa6249f,7,This taught me that I have to check in with myself once in a while.
60895dd42aa4dab10a53566c,1,I was working on the floor of the warehouse moving stock around
60895dd42aa4dab10a53566c,2,and making sure it was all in it's proper place.
60895dd42aa4dab10a53566c,3,Nearing the end of the day I felt light headed
60895dd42aa4dab10a53566c,4,but put it down to not having eaten that day.
60895dd42aa4dab10a53566c,5,I carried on working
60895dd42aa4dab10a53566c,6,and eventually started to get ready to go home.
60895dd42aa4dab10a53566c,7,As I was walking around the warehouse tidying up
60895dd42aa4dab10a53566c,8,and getting everything prepared for the next day
60895dd42aa4dab10a53566c,9,I felt a tightness in my chest
60895dd42aa4dab10a53566c,10,and felt dizzy.
60895dd42aa4dab10a53566c,11,Spots appeared in front of my eyes
60895dd42aa4dab10a53566c,12,and I started sweating.
60895dd42aa4dab10a53566c,13,I could feel the world closing in on me
60895dd42aa4dab10a53566c,14,when I heard someone call out.
60895dd42aa4dab10a53566c,15,It was my manager who was asking me if I was OK
60895dd42aa4dab10a53566c,16,and was walking towards me.
60895dd42aa4dab10a53566c,17,I started collapsing as my manager arrived
60895dd42aa4dab10a53566c,18,and he took me to the staff room
60895dd42aa4dab10a53566c,19,where he sat me down
60895dd42aa4dab10a53566c,20,and gave me a glass of water.
60895dd42aa4dab10a53566c,21,I soon felt better.
60895dd42aa4dab10a53566c,22,It seems I had a panic attack
60895dd42aa4dab10a53566c,23,and have learned that I need to look after myself by eating properly
60895dd42aa4dab10a53566c,24,and having a drink occasionally.
6156ee61901c987ea794cca8,1,I was working late one night doing my usual job in the warehouse.
6156ee61901c987ea794cca8,2,"Putting things away, getting them out, warehouse stuff."
6156ee61901c987ea794cca8,3,I suddenly started to feel bad;

6156ee61901c987ea794cca8,5,my chest hurt
6156ee61901c987ea794cca8,6,and my breathing got really really fast.
6156ee61901c987ea794cca8,7,I leaned on a wall to try and feel better
6156ee61901c987ea794cca8,8,but it didn't help.
6156ee61901c987ea794cca8,9,Then I heard the voice of my manager saying that someone had noticed how sick I was.
6156ee61901c987ea794cca8,10,My manager sat me down
6156ee61901c987ea794cca8,11,and gave me some water.
6156ee61901c987ea794cca8,12,"They told me I'd been having a panic attack,"
6156ee61901c987ea794cca8,13,which I have often.
6156ee61901c987ea794cca8,14,"I guess the lesson is to check with yourself,"
6156ee61901c987ea794cca8,15,eat well
6156ee61901c987ea794cca8,16,and rest.
59f88f6eb47dfc0001b661ef,1,"Person was working in a warehouse,"

59f88f6eb47dfc0001b661ef,4,"such as chest pain,"

59f88f6eb47dfc0001b661ef,7,but they were unable to respond
59f88f6eb47dfc0001b661ef,8,and collapsed.
59f88f6eb47dfc0001b661ef,9,The manager was able to catch the person
59f88f6eb47dfc0001b661ef,10,before they passed out

59f88f6eb47dfc0001b661ef,12,The manager got them a glass of water.

5e8df7e8ae7a8007d30505e1,2,they had not eaten or drank anything that day.
5e8df7e8ae7a8007d30505e1,3,They then got sweaty and began to see stars/things went dark -
5e8df7e8ae7a8007d30505e1,4,at this point someone had noticed and told the manager.
5e8df7e8ae7a8007d30505e1,5,"As the person begun to collapse,"
5e8df7e8ae7a8007d30505e1,6,the manager caught them which saved them.
5e8df7e8ae7a8007d30505e1,7,This could've been much worst if it wasn't for the manager.
5e8df7e8ae7a8007d30505e1,8,"They slowly come round after the manager gave them water,"
5e8df7e8ae7a8007d30505e1,9,they were suffering from a panic attack.
5e8df7e8ae7a8007d30505e1,10,This caused the person to reflect and to think about checking in with themselves to see if they're okay
5e8df7e8ae7a8007d30505e1,11,and if they need food or water.
5f0771a92b566a37faa5f2e0,1,"I was at work,"
5f0771a92b566a37faa5f2e0,2,working in the warehouse.

5f0771a92b566a37faa5f2e0,5,I was feeling unsteady
5f0771a92b566a37faa5f2e0,6,and so I leaned on a nearby wall.
5f0771a92b566a37faa5f2e0,7,My manager came in
5f0771a92b566a37faa5f2e0,8,and asked if I was ok
5f0771a92b566a37faa5f2e0,9,and when I tried to shout back to tell them something was wrong
5f0771a92b566a37faa5f2e0,10,I couldn't find my voice.
5f0771a92b566a37faa5f2e0,11,I could feel my world go dark.
5f0771a92b566a37faa5f2e0,12,Just as I felt my legs give out
5f0771a92b566a37faa5f2e0,13,my manager caught me.
5f0771a92b566a37faa5f2e0,14,He took me to the office
5f0771a92b566a37faa5f2e0,15,and sat me in a chair.
5f0771a92b566a37faa5f2e0,16,It turns out I was having a panic attack.
5f0771a92b566a37faa5f2e0,17,This taught me to remember to check in on myself more often
5f0771a92b566a37faa5f2e0,18,and to make sure I eat and drink to prevent future episodes.
63d2c0361e822bd39d52da55,1,I was working my usual job - stocking boxes at the warehouse.
63d2c0361e822bd39d52da55,2,Then all of a sudden I felt a strange feeling.

63d2c0361e822bd39d52da55,4,I also had a shortness of breath and leaned against a nearby wall.

63d2c0361e822bd39d52da55,7,I tried to answer but couldn't find my voice.
63d2c0361e822bd39d52da55,8,Then my world started to get dark.
63d2c0361e822bd39d52da55,9,I started to fall but my manager caught me just in time.
63d2c0361e822bd39d52da55,10,"It was never a fun situation, but it could have been worse,"
63d2c0361e822bd39d52da55,11,and I escaped thanks to the quick thinking of my manager.
63d2c0361e822bd39d52da55,12,I found out that I had been having a panic attack.
63d2c0361e822bd39d52da55,13,In the future I'll eat better and get more rest.

5ba641d1168e5e0001e4275d,5,and my vision was going dark with dots appearing in it.

5ba641d1168e5e0001e4275d,9,and thanks to the quick action of my manager they managed to catch me before I hit the ground.
5ba641d1168e5e0001e4275d,10,"I was guided to the staff room and given a cold glass of water,"

5ba641d1168e5e0001e4275d,12,and told me to take a rest.
5ba641d1168e5e0001e4275d,13,After a few minutes the pressure in my chest lessened
5ba641d1168e5e0001e4275d,14,and I realised I'd had a panic attack.
5ba641d1168e5e0001e4275d,15,"Thanks to the quick action of my manager, it wasn't as worse as it could've been."

60b889967014a024377477fa,2,The subject began feeling strange and lightheaded
60b889967014a024377477fa,3,but thought it was most likely because they had not eaten that day.
60b889967014a024377477fa,4,Suddenly the subject started feeling a pressure in their chest.
60b889967014a024377477fa,5,The pressure got worse

60b889967014a024377477fa,16,and their vision black out
60b889967014a024377477fa,17,but thankfully the manager got there just in time

645f5e3b5bce2735681daf60,1,I was working one day at work
645f5e3b5bce2735681daf60,2,where I was organising some stock.

645f5e3b5bce2735681daf60,4,"but continued on,"
645f5e3b5bce2735681daf60,5,then a dizziness came over me
645f5e3b5bce2735681daf60,6,and I felt a bit funny
645f5e3b5bce2735681daf60,7,and a tightness in chest came on.
645f5e3b5bce2735681daf60,8,I started walking around the warehouse
645f5e3b5bce2735681daf60,9,but it didn't get any better
645f5e3b5bce2735681daf60,10,so I stopped.
645f5e3b5bce2735681daf60,11,I heard a voice across the warehouse
645f5e3b5bce2735681daf60,12,"and it was my manager,"
645f5e3b5bce2735681daf60,13,someone must have noticed I didn't feel too well.

645f5e3b5bce2735681daf60,16,I thought it was going to fall
645f5e3b5bce2735681daf60,17,but my manager made it in time to catch me.

645f5e3b5bce2735681daf60,19,and got me some cold water

645f5e3b5bce2735681daf60,21,They asked what happened
645f5e3b5bce2735681daf60,22,and if I was ok.
645f5e3b5bce2735681daf60,23,I now know it was a panic attack
645f5e3b5bce2735681daf60,24,and that it would have been a lot worse.
645f5e3b5bce2735681daf60,25,I know I should check in with myself
645f5e3b5bce2735681daf60,26,to see how I am doing.
