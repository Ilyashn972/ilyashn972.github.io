I went to go and put some merchandise back in its correct place and I started to feel tightness in my chest. I had to lean against the wall. I started seeing black dots in front of me eyes. My manager called my name from across the warehouse. Someone had noticed that I wasn’t okay. I tried to shout back that something was wrong but I couldn’t find my voice. My legs started to give way but my manager got to me and managed to catch me. My manager got me a glass of cold water. I started to feel better. It turned out I had had a panic attack. It made me realise that I need to look after myself and eat properly.
