I was at work in my job at a warehouse, on the floor, stocking up and checking things. All of a sudden I started to feel a bit funny, but put it down to my not having eaten anything yet that day. I thought it would pass, but then I felt a bit stranger, with a pain in my chest. I felt sweat dripping down my face and chest. Then I heard a voice. It was a co-worker who had noticed I wasn’t quite right and wanted to check I was ok. I was about to answer, but my legs gave way. At that moment, my manager came over and managed to catch me. He took me to the staff room and sat me down and gave me some water, asking me questions about what had happened. I gradually began to feel better and vowed to check in with myself more often, making sure I always had enough food, water and sleep."
