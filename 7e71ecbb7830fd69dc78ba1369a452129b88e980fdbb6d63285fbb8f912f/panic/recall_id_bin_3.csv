I felt a bit light-headed, but chalked it up to having not eaten earlier in the day. I started to suffer pains in my chest. I leaned against a wall and started seeing spots. I heard a voice from across the warehouse it was my manager. He was been watching and noticed I was having trouble. I lost control of my legs and was about to fall, but my manager caught me and took me to a chair in the office, just as my vision was starting to go dark. It turns out I had just had a panic attack. It was an extremely stressful experience, but it could have been much worse. This incident made me realize how important it is to check on myself and eat regularly."

They felt pressure in their chest, and leaned against a wall to alleviate it. But it did not go away, it felt worse, and their heart began pounding. Their manager called out to them. It appears a colleague noticed the narrator's predicament and got the manager for help. The manager grabbed the narrator just as their legs gave out from under them. From there, the manager took the narrator to the lunch room for cold water (to drink, if I remember correctly). This alleviated the symptoms. It turns out the narrator had a panic attack. The narrator finishes musing that the situation could have been worse at it reminded them to 'check in on (them)self' occasionally. Basically relaxation and mindfulness techniques."
