I started feeling a tightness in my chest and sweat dripping down my brow. Someone had caught on to my state of distress, the manager, and had called out to me. I tried responding but my voice was stuck in my throat and the room started spinning. The manager made his way to me and I started falling, my legs giving out but the manager made it to catch me in time. He took me to the staff room, asked questions about what was wrong and handed me a glass of water.

I started to feel dizzy and light-headed and my chest felt heavy. At first I thought it was because I was tired and hungry. It started to get worse and I stopped doing what I was doing and leaned against a shelf. I started to see spots and felt sweat dripping down my forehead. I tried to take big breaths, but I just couldn't catch my breath. My manager saw me from across the warehouse floor and called out to see if I was alright. Apparently, someone was watching me and was checking to see if I was okay. I felt my world start to go dark and my legs started to give way. Luckily, my manager got to me and caught me before I hit the floor. He took me to the staff room and got me a glass of cold water. After a few minutes, my chest felt better. It turns out I had been having a panic attack. It was never pleasant, but it could have been a lot worse. This taught me to make sure I drink enough water and get enough rest to ensure this doesn't happen again."
