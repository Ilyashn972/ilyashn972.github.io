  <p>Well, I was at work one day and I was doing my usual job - working on the warehouse floor, stocking boxes and organizing merchandise. I had been working for a few hours and it was getting late. I had been feeling a bit strange, a bit lightheaded, but chalked it up to hunger and not having eaten yet that day.</p>
