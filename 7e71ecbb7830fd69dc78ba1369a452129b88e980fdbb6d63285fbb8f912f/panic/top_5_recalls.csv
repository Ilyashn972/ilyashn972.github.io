5cc7050c3c503e001aa6249f,I was at my job at the warehouse organising packages. I suddenly felt a tightness in my chest and had to stop. My vision started getting spotty and I was about to collapse. My coworker saw me in trouble and alerted my manager. My manager took me to the staff room and got me a glass of cold water. After a while I learned that it was due to a panic attack. This taught me that I have to check in with myself once in a while.,424,23.514408095560007,0.06

They slumped themselves against a wall when their manager called out to them. The manager approached whilst they were seeing spots with sweat running down their forehead and arms. Right before their legs gave out, the manager was able to catch them just as they collapsed. The manager helped carry them away to his office and gave them a cold glass of water. Eventually the tightness in their chest disappeared. It turns out the worker was having a panic attack. They were told to get proper rest and eat better in order to take care of themselves and prevent further panic attacks.",755,57.72846987486001,0.08
63f7ebd5b7cf8a1e373b714c,"Well, one day I was working at the Warehouse. My job is to stack boxes and work on the warehouse floor. I had been working for a few hours and it was getting rather late. I had felt a bit strange and lightheaded. I thought I was hungry as I hadn't eaten yet. As I was walking around the warehouse and putting items back, I started feeling a strange pressure in my chest. I had to lean against a wall but it didn't help. It was getting worse and my heart was pounding in my chest. I then started sweating and tried to take deep breaths. I then heard a voice from across the warehouse - it was the manager. He was checking to see I was okay. However, I couldn't respond as my voice was tight. I dropped to the ground and the manager luckily caught me before my legs gave out. He asked me what was wrong and told me to sit down with a glass of water. I started feeling better and realised I'd had a panic attack. The situation could have been much worse and it taught me to make sure I eat and rest properly to avoid further episodes.",1031,125.85975262326,0.12
