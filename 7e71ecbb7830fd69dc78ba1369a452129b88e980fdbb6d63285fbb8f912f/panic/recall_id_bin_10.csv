They were checking stock. Then they started to feel lightheaded. They thought they were just hungry. But then they started to get chest pains. As they pressed their chest they started to feel sweaty. And see dark spots. They started to lean against the wall. And realised something was wrong. They heard a voice. Which was their manager asking if they were ok. But they could not use their own voice to reply. And ask for help. The manager came over in time. And managed to catch them so they didn't collapse on the floor. The manager took them to the medical room. Sat them down. And gave them water. The manager asked the person questions. And explained to them that they had had a panic attack. The person learned that they needed to rest. And eat well in order to avoid panic attacks in the future.

After a few hours I felt light headed and felt a tightness in my chest. The pressure got stronger and my heart was pounding. I started sweating and I couldn't breathe. I heard the voice of the warehouse manager asking if I was ok. I couldn't reply. Someone had noticed I looked a bit off. I felt the world go dark, my legs gave way beneath me, but I was caught before I fell. I was taken to the staff room and given a glass of water. It turns out I had a panic attack. It could have been worse if the manager hadn't taken prompt action. I've learned to listen to myself to avoid further attacks."

He decided to lean against a stack of boxes and rest for a few minutes, but when trying to take a deep breath, he couldn't catch his breath. Feeling sweat rolling down his head and arms, he heard someone - his manager - call out to him to see if he was okay, yet he wasn't able to find his voice to shout back in reply. As the manager came closer, he felt his world go black, before he started to fall to his knees - but not before his manager caught him in time before he hit the floor.
