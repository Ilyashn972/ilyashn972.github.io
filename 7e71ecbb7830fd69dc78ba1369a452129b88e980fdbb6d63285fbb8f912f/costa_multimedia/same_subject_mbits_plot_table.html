      <td>My daughter was in the hospital, Marie. She had an operation in winter. In the hospital, the next room was a woman. The hospital called me about Marie because she was being discharged. [I] got ready and made sure to take my coat and dress in my arms as I went to the hospital. Marie could see me from the windows, and she was saying goodbye to a lady who was next to her. Meanwhile, her father worked in the yard, and when he heard that I was going to the hospital, he shaved and got ready as he sat on the stairs. I heard the nurses rushing and calling the doctors, and when I asked, "What is going on?" the nurse said it was my daughter. [And] so I yelled "What did you do to my daughter?" [And] Marie collapsed on the floor and passed away and I was screaming and yelling at the nurses and so the nurses wanted to give me the shot and I refused and told them, "You want to kill me?" [And] I knew all the nurses because I had three operations [at] in less than a year. I screamed as the doctors and nurses were taking my daughter, "I'll burn this hospital to the ground if you touch my daughter. I don't care who dies in it," and at home, my other daughter, Victoria, was getting worried seeing that I was not home yet, because they were all excited to have Marie back home. And so they came to the hospital looking for us, and when they saw me, I was in a mess and my hair was all pulled up, and [I] sent my son, who was little then, to go tell the two aunties that Marie passed away because they were also waiting for me and Marie to get home. When my sisters saw my son crying, and when they asked him, he told them that Marie had passed away. And when my husband heard the news, he collapsed and had a heart attack, and my son Michael had a heart attack. I am not exaggerating. So that is what happened.</td>
