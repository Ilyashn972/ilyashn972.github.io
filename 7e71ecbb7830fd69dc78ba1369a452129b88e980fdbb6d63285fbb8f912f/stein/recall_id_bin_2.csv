This person's mother went shopping. Father went somewhere. People threw rocks at their house. The narrator ran to mom at 4th street. There were horses. On the way there the narrator saw a policeman. They lived in an Irish neighborhood. Where blacks were not welcome. The mom asked the policeman what they can do. Nothing could be done. They went to the police station. The chief said to move out. But they had already paid their rent for the month. And did not have any money to go anywhere else. So she suggested that if people wanted them gone they get enough money to move out. But those people probably didn't have money either.

We were in the front room when we heard a crash, looked and there was a stone in the middle of the room. They were smashing the windows. Mum took us to the stairs so we wouldn’t get hit by flying glass. We were told it was an Irish neighbourhood and they didn’t want black people there. Mum told them she had paid all the money she had to move in, so there was no way she would move out. She said it was the real estate agents fault. This was in 1925 and horse pulled police cabins. We rode in one and went home. It was a very terrifying experience for me."

The Jewish people could earn as much money as possible. They went to the police station to report it. The policeman said there was nothing he could do. He was Irish. She said escort me home. All the neighbours will see. When she got home she told all neighbours she had paid one month's rent upfront. She could not afford to move. So they were staying. The husband got sick. The neighbours were now very helpful. They were quite poor. It turns out so were the neighbours.

As soon as they moved into the house some locals threw stones through the family's windows causing the younger members of the family to be scared. The mother of the family requested help from the police officer, who was also irish and he wasn't very helpful, he seemed to share the same disdain for the family, though more veiled due to his position. The officers only solution to the familys predicament was to move away, the mother said she couldnt possibly since she has just moved in, paid for a months rent so told the officer and whoever else nearby that was listening that they have no choice but to accept that they will be there for at least a month and if they want them to leave that badly they should pool together enough money so they can afford to move away, they of course didn't do this since they are likely struggling just as much as them.

He asked me if I saw who did it I said I hadn't and he said therefore he cant do anything because there is no one to blame.

Suddenly, stones began hitting the windows, so my mother went out to see what was happening, and I went with her. We saw that people were throwing stones at our house. We found a police officer, who advised us to move out of the neighbourhood as we wouldn't be welcome. We went to the police station to report the incident. My mother told the office in charge that the police should protect them. He asked if my mother had seen the face of anyone throwing stones. She said she hadn't, so the officer asked how he could punish anyone if he didn't know who to punish. My mother asked him to drive us home, so he did. To my admiration, my mother said to the stone-throwers that we'd just moved in to the house and we didn't have enough money to pay to move out, so she asked the people to collectively find enough money to give us so we could move out. People didn't give us any money, but they did leave us alone. However, the whole experience made my father unwell."

Their parents were not at home, and they lived in a Jewish neighborhood. Startled by the incident, the child quickly gathered the other kids and moved them to safety. The child then decided to investigate what had hit the window. While searching for their mom at a nearby store, they caught the attention of an Irish police officer. The officer inquired why the child appeared scared. When the mom finally arrived and learned about the incident, she asked the officer for assistance. However, the officer regretfully responded, ""I can't do anything about it."" The mom became upset and requested the officer's captain's name so she could discuss the matter at the police station. Upon speaking to the police captain, she was met with a similar response. The captain explained that their hands were tied, and they couldn't take any action. Frustrated, the mom expressed her inability to move out of the neighborhood due to financial constraints."
