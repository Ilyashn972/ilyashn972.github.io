Despite being frightened, the narrator took protective action by moving the siblings to a safe area and went out to find their mother.

This left the narrator alone to care for their siblings. Suddenly, the house was attacked with stones, shattering windows and terrifying the children. Despite being frightened, the ten-year-old narrator managed to protect their siblings and ran to find their mother at a nearby market in a Jewish neighborhood. After explaining the situation to their mother, a police officer overheard their conversation and acknowledged the neighborhood was known for being hostile toward black people. Despite their mother's plea for help, the officer, who was Irish, said there was nothing he could do because he couldnâ€™t act without knowing who threw the stones, and advised them to move since the area was not welcoming to black residents. Undeterred, the mother took a stand and went to the police station with her child to demand action. The police station captain also told them there was nothing to be done and suggested moving again. However, the mother insisted that she couldn't afford to move since all their money was spent on rent. Determined, she persuaded the police to drive them home in a patrol wagon, making a statement to the neighborhood upon arrival. Once there, she confronted the gathered neighbors, expressing her distress and need for a peaceful home. She explained she had no intention to leave because she had paid rent for the month and could not afford to replace the broken windows.

The girl's father, who had a drinking problem, left to return the horses after moving their belongings, leaving her alone with her siblings while the mother went to the market. Soon after, the house was attacked with stones by hostile neighbors, prompting the girl to protect her siblings and seek her mother. She found her mother on Fourth Street, a busy Jewish neighborhood known for its pushcart markets. While explaining the situation to her mother, a policeman intervened, informing them that the neighborhood, primarily Irish, opposed black residents. The policeman, himself Irish, admitted he couldn't help, suggesting they move elsewhere, but the mother refused due to financial constraints. Determined to resolve the issue, the mother confronted the precinct captain, who also advised moving out, citing inability to act without identifying the perpetrators. However, the mother argued that the real estate agent should be accountable for renting them the house. Insistent on not moving due to lack of funds, the mother secured a ride home in a police patrol wagon, drawing attention from the community. Upon returning, the mother addressed the gathered neighbors, emphasizing their human similarities despite racial differences, and their right to remain given the rent they had paid. She challenged the community to offer financial help if they wanted the family to leave, which was unlikely since they likely faced their own financial challenges.
