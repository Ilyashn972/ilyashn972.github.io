7,But he didn't come home.,25,71,-46,46
47,"He says, “But they don't want any black people in there.”",81,44,37,37
40,And then when he understood what the situation was he turned to my mother,52,17,35,35
27,"I ran to Fourth street, because I knew my mother wa-",57,92,-35,35
48,An' he didn't say black 'cause they didn't use black then.,39,4,35,35
6,And my father went to take the horses – take the team of horses back.,54,87,-33,33
51,You're supposed to protect us.”,22,54,-32,32
103,"and faced all those people that were standing around,",56,87,-31,31
74,"He says, “Well how can – how can you” – to my mother – “how can you do anything if you don't know who – who to put the blame on?”",40,9,31,31
128,But that was our welcoming to the neighborhood.,18,46,-28,28
65,"And this was – let me see what year was this happening – well it must have been nineteen twenty-five, so you can see what – what the times were.",36,10,26,26
100,And they had a long door in the back where you had to come down steps to get out the back of the – of this police patrol.,29,3,26,26
14,And I had sense enough to get the kids into the stairway so that they wouldn't get hurt by flyin' glass.,71,97,-26,26
75,"An' he says, “I'm sure there was more than one person.”",31,6,25,25
78,"They took all we had to, to pay the rent.",67,42,25,25
91,We weren't far from – from where it was – maybe Fifth street – from where we had moved.,30,6,24,24
99,and opened the door in the back.,27,4,23,23
2,We had gotten moved,29,6,23,23
72,"He says, “Because” – he said to me, “Did you see anyone?”",30,7,23,23
17,And I'm gonna go and see if I can find mom” –,65,88,-23,23
50,"So uh, she said, “Well you're the law.",33,55,-22,22
49,But “they don't want anybody in there.”,26,4,22,22
96,And um all the neighbors came running out to see what was happening.,51,73,-22,22
3,"but it was like – you remember I told you my father drank,",41,63,-22,22
12,And I – and I looked and it was a big stone.,78,99,-21,21
26,I was ten years old at the time this happened –,46,25,21,21
89,So they put us in the police patrol,71,92,-21,21
101,Well we got out of that police patrol –,24,4,20,20
121,So you might just as well make up your mind to that.,49,29,20,20
70,"And she says, “You mean to tell me that I have to live under those circumstances and there's nothing that you can do about it?”",43,23,20,20
30,and they – they stayed open until – until all hours.,24,4,20,20
93,they had a bell that clanged. Clang clang clang –,42,22,20,20
92,"And – course with the horses and the police patrol, and the clang –",36,17,19,19
1,We moved down to Third and Wharton.,76,95,-19,19
34,I did find her.,42,61,-19,19
94,you know they told you about the trolley that went “Clang.”,26,7,19,19
33,And I finally found my mother.,77,96,-19,19
129,And it was terrible,17,35,-18,18
41,"and says, “This is a bad neighborhood.",78,96,-18,18
87,So – I guess they figured “Let's get this lady out of here because she's talking loud and long.”,26,8,18,18
73,"And I said, “No.”",28,10,18,18
116,"She said, “It is winter time and it is cold.",45,27,18,18
13,And then of course they – they – well they stoned the house.,88,70,18,18
98,"I can see it right now – from where he was sitting up front there where the horses came around,",20,3,17,17
29,And it was a Jewish neighborhood,44,27,17,17
53,He was Irish himself.,58,41,17,17
126,And the neighbors were as nice as anybody could ever have been.,69,85,-16,16
102,Before the patrol ever left my mother turned,58,74,-16,16
97,And of course they saw the man came around the back –,19,3,16,16
95,"Well this police patrol that bell they had, it went “Clang clang clang.”",22,6,16,16
44,Better move out of there.”,56,72,-16,16
38,"I was so nervous and – and – my voice was shaking so,",37,21,16,16
31,"Because they would, you know, however much money they could get they wanted.",16,0,16,16
81,Now the real estate agent should be accountable.”,30,45,-15,15
90,and they took us home.,69,84,-15,15
112,She knew she was going to be there for the month.,52,66,-14,14
79,In that house you had to pay in advance.,35,21,14,14
85,"He said, “Take you home?”",20,6,14,14
114,Whether they'd have enough money to pay it for the next month.,54,40,14,14
86,"She said, “Yes in the police patrol.”",51,65,-14,14
130,and it certainly was frightening for me.,9,23,-14,14
5,"and after he had gotten in and put the furniture where it was supposed to go, my mother left, to go to market to get some food to bring into the house.",66,80,-14,14
19,And they were crying,20,6,14,14
25,And I ran –,52,66,-14,14
37,And my voice was such that you could hardly make out what I was saying.,35,21,14,14
123,Well of course you know they didn't do that.,26,39,-13,13
67,And they also had police wagons with horses attached to them. Believe it or not in those days.,24,11,13,13
117,And I cannot afford to be buying windows.”,42,29,13,13
62,But thankfully my mother was not one of those kind.,25,37,-12,12
88,And they had never come up with anybody like that.,18,6,12,12
8,"He – stopped somewhere on – I dunno,",17,5,12,12
32,So uh that's where she was going to do her shopping.,28,17,11,11
35,And while I was trying to tell her what had happened,49,38,11,11
66,"And we went – she took me, and we went to the police station.",79,90,-11,11
64,She went to Lackawanna high school.,17,6,11,11
124,They probably didn't have any money either.,18,8,10,10
54,“I can't do anything about it.”,44,34,10,10
119,But you can all see what has happened.,34,24,10,10
46,"He says, “I dunno.”",15,5,10,10
56,And he told her.,14,4,10,10
20,and carryin' on.,13,3,10,10
104,"and she says, “Why you're doing this to me I don't know.”",50,59,-9,9
118,"“Now” she said, “Whoever threw the stones I don't know.",34,25,9,9
9,but he – how he – why he wasn't in the house.,15,6,9,9
24,but I remember saying a prayer as I went out the front door because I didn't know what was gonna hit me when I went out that door.,46,55,-9,9
45,"My mother said, “I just moved in, how am I gonna move out?”",36,27,9,9
61,"Well in those days black people were so cowed by circumstances an' uniforms and white people, you know, they uh many times didn't assert themselves.",22,13,9,9
63,And she – well I always thought of her as an educated person which she was because she was the only one I knew who had completed high school.,34,25,9,9
77,"She says, “But one thing I know I'm not going to do is move. Because I have no money to move with.”",78,87,-9,9
15,"And I said to them, “Now you stay there.",51,59,-8,8
59,but I've forgotten where he told her.,11,3,8,8
109,"she told them how much money she had paid,",43,51,-8,8
43,"And he said, “They're known to do things like that,",55,47,8,8
68,"So my mother said, to the captain, “What are you going to do about it?”",43,51,-8,8
83,"And he says, “What's that?”",13,5,8,8
80,"And she said, “If they didn't want me there they should not have rented the house to me.",46,38,8,8
23,"And I didn't know what to do,",16,8,8,8
122,"If you don't want me here then you people get together and give me enough money to move somewhere else, because I do not have it.”",72,65,7,7
76,"So my mother said, “Well I don't know what I'm going to do.”",17,10,7,7
16,Don't move 'cause nothing will reach you here.,47,54,-7,7
42,It's Irish.”,71,64,7,7
82,"So anyhow, she said to him, “Well I know one thing you can do.”",23,30,-7,7
57,I forgot now.,10,4,6,6
113,She did not know beyond the month.,57,51,6,6
11,Well no sooner did my mother get out of the house – my father went first – then – oh it was such an awful crash came through the window.,94,100,-6,6
60,"So uh she said, “Well if you can't do anything to help me, I'll go see who – if I can't find someone else to help me.”",45,40,5,5
21,"I was scared to death,",44,39,5,5
52,"He says, “I can't do anything with it.”",72,67,5,5
58,I was right there with her,11,6,5,5
127,When there was trouble they responded just like anyone else.,57,53,4,4
22,I really was frightened out of my wits.,40,36,4,4
106,"but in every other respect I'm just the same as you are,",61,65,-4,4
110,she had told them that was all the money she had.,52,48,4,4
39,and he wanted to find out what ha- what was wrong with me.,55,52,3,3
69,"And he says, “Well lady there's nothing we can do about it.”",65,62,3,3
28,"They had push carts in those days, on Fourth street.",19,22,-3,3
4,"but it was still day,",6,3,3,3
71,"She says – he says, “Well uh the only thing I can tell you to do is to move.”",65,68,-3,3
18,(We call our mother mom.),6,4,2,2
111,And they had paid that rent for a month.,55,53,2,2
108,"She told them that they had rented the house,",45,47,-2,2
84,"She says, “You can take me home.”",60,61,-1,1
125,"So in the meantime – not in the meantime but during, during the period of time that we were there, my father became sick.",62,63,-1,1
10,And of course I was left there with the kids.,54,53,1,1
115,But she knew they were going to be there for the month.,56,55,1,1
107,and all I'm trying to do is provide a home for my family.”,46,47,-1,1
55,"So my mother said um, “Where is the uh precinct you work from?”",41,42,-1,1
120,And now I'm telling you that we're going to be here for a month.,39,39,0,0
36,a policeman went by.,72,72,0,0
105,"She says, “I know that I am different from you, color wise,",60,60,0,0
