Shortly after his mother left there was a huge crash and a window in the house was smashed. The child was afraid, but he managed to move the younger children into the stairwell where no stones could reach. He ran out to look for his mother who was shopping in the Jewish area, where shop-keepers worked long hours to maximise their income. He managed to find her and tell her what had happened. She asked for directions to the police station and she, and the child, went there. The police were sympathetic but unable to offer any help. They didn't expressly say it, but they indicated that the trouble was because the family are black and this is a predominantly Irish neighbourhood. Their only suggestion was that she move the family into a different area. The mother was indignant at this and pointed out that she could not afford to move again. As the police could not offer any help, she asked them to at least take her and the child home, which they did, in a noisy, horse-drawn police vehicle. The noise brought out all her neighbours, which gave the mother the opportunity to address them all. She told them that she could not afford to move, she had paid a month's rent on the property and would be there for at least that time. After that, who knew. She was defiant and strong when she spoke to them, pointed out that other than skin colour they were the same and that she should be allowed to live there in peace."

The narrator was 10. The father was day drinking and out of the house, after he'd moved their furniture into the house. The mother was out shopping. A rock crashed through the windows of the house. The children hid in the hallway to avoid the glass. The oldest of the children ran out of the house to Fourth Street, where the mother was. There, they found a policeman. He told them that this was a bad neighbourhood, and that they should move. He was Irish. The mother told him that they didn't have any money to move, and they had just moved into the house. He said there was nothing he could do. She was a smart black woman, the only one in her family to have finished high school. She asked where the nearest police station was, so that she could ask someone who would be able to do something. At the station, she got the same answer: that there was nothing to be done, except move. She then told them there was one thing they could do: to drive them home in the patrol car. They did. The car made such a clanging noise that all of their neighbours came out of their houses to see what was happening. When she got out of the police car, the mother announced to the neighbours that she knows she looks different due to having different skin colour, but that they could only afford to stay in the house a month. Perhaps they would get enough money to afford to stay another month, but in the meantime, the neighbours only had to put up with them for a month. She didn't know who threw the rock, she told them, but it was winter and it was cold, and she couldn't afford new windows. She said that she had no money to move right away, but if they wanted, the neighbours could give her the money to move. They didn't do that, but afterwards, when the father got sick, they were kind and courteous to the family."

After they had moved in, the father took the horses away and the mother went shopping. While the narrator was at home with the other children, their house was attacked and stones were thrown through the window. Once the narrator had hidden the children he went to find his mother at the Jewish shop, which stayed open late and served anyone. Once the shopkeeper had heard what had happened he told the mother that they lived in a bad neighbourhood and should leave. The mother said she couldn't leave because she had used all her money for the first month's rent. The mother went to the police to complain and they also told her to leave. It was an Irish neighbourhood in the 1920s and, because they were black, they would never fit in. The mother insisted the police drive her home. When she got home, she addressed the neighbours - explaining that she had no money to move and they were stuck with her for the month and better get used to the idea. After that the neighbours were much friendlier and even helped when the father got sick."

The father had gone to tend to the horses and then some people came and threw stones at the house. The family were all afraid and so they fled. They asked for help in a Jewish neighbourhood and then were directed to a police station. The police were unhelpful initially and told the family the solution was to move. The mother explained that due to financial reasons this was impossible. She insisted that the police take them home and so they rode in the back of the police wagon with the bell clanging. They arrived home and climbed down the back steps of the wagon to be met by several neighbours watching. The mother gave an impassioned speech about how, despite their colour they were just the same as everyone else. This changed people's opinions and they then helped and supported the family even when the Father became ill."

One day they come home, and after their parents go out (their father to fetch some horses, their mother to shop at the local Jewish market which stays open late), someone throws a stone through the window of their home, smashing the glass and scaring the child and their siblings. They go to find their mother, and encounter a policeman. The child and their mother complain to the policeman about what happens; the policeman blames the Irish neighbourhood, being Irish himself, and attributes it to them not wanting Black neighbours. He says he can't do anything about it, so the mother insists on attending his precinct, and speaking to his captain. The captain also claims not to be able to help, so the mother asks him to drive them home in the patrol vehicle. They're dropped off near their home, the noise of the vehicle draws out their neighbours, and she addresses them all, telling them that if they don't want her and her family there, they should pay for them to move house, as she can't afford it, and will be there for at least a month. Thereafter, the neighbours are kind to them, especially when the child's father is sick, but the child holds onto the memory of that frightening welcome to the neighbourhood."

Upon finding the mom, the mom then talks to a police officer and asks for help. The officer, who is also Irish, says that there is nothing he can do and implies that moving out of that neighbourhood is the best course of action. Unsatisfied with this answer, the mom goes to the police station to talk to someone higher up. She is received better here, but is still told nothing can be done because she didn't see who threw the stones. The officer gives the mom a ride back home in a carriage with the clanging bells.
