They were a black family who rented in an irish neighborhood for a month. The boy's father went to attend the horses outside. The mother went to fourth street which is a market. The boy was home alone with just his younger siblings. He heard a loud noise crashing through the window. The loud crash was a rock that was thrown through the window. The boy managed to keep his siblings protected from the window glass by standing on the staircase. He was scared and ran outside to find his mom at fourth street. When the boy found his mother there was surprisingly a policeman passing by. He managed to explain the story of what happened to the policeman and his mother. The policeman was understanding but mentioned that there was nothing he could do to help. Probably due to the racial segregation existing at those times. The mother was relentless and opted to go to the nearest police station to find someone to help with this matter if this policeman can't. She went to the police station where they told her the same thing and suggested she moved out. She mentions she can't move out because she paid the rent for the month with her last money. She asked the policeman take her home in his carriage instead. When she arrived she told the irish people in the neighborhood if they want her to leave they must collectively contribute enough money for her to move out because she doesn't have any money left over to move out. After her speech, the neighborhood treated her better and more neighborly after that."

My mother went to the shops to get food for the family. My father had gone to fetch the team of horses. Then we heard a loud thunder. It was a stone. So I told the kids to go under the stairways. They could not get hurt. They cried and carrying on. I told them not to move. Stay there as I needed to go and get my mother. I was so scared as I went to the door. I did not know what was gone be thrown at me as I opened the door. I went out run to the fourth street. It was not far from where we had moved to. I found my mother. The policemen passed by. I told him what had happened. He said he could not help us with anything. He said we should move. He insisted that he could not help us. They people in that area were Irish and did not want black people there. My mother said we should go to the police station to find someone who could help us. The officer in charge said he could not help us as well. My mother asked the police officer to take us home with their cart which had a bell which goes clang clang clang. So when we approached our area everyone rushed outside to see. When the door was opened for us a lot of people where standing outside. My mother addressed them. My mother told them how much we were charged for rent. She said if they wanted us to move they can all contributed money. So that we could move. No one contributed. From then there were nice to us. But the welcome was frightening.

I told you my father used to drink, so he went out. My mother went out to buy some food, leaving me alone with the kids. Just after she had left I heard a loud crash. I saw stones coming through the window. I grabbed the kids and hid in the stairs. I told them ""Stay here, nothing can reach you here. I'm going to try to find mom."" (We called our mother ""Mom"".) I was only 10 years old at the time. I was so scared walking towards the front door, I didn't know what I would see. There were shops nearby, in the Jewish neighbourhood. They were open all hours because they tried to take what money they could get. That's where my mother was. There were carts on the street. I ran up to my mother and started telling her what happened. A police officer went past. I was so scared I could hardly be understood. The police officer stopped, he wanted to find out what had happened and what was wrong with me. He started speaking to my mother. ""You're in a bad neighbourhood. There's nothing anyone can do for you, the people there are Irish."" He was Irish himself. ""They don't want black people living there."" But he didn't say black. ""They don't want anyone in that house, you should move."" ""We can't move."" My mother said. ""We don't have any money. If you can't do anything then tell me where your precinct is."" We went to the police station where the officer worked. We spoke to another police officer there. ""You should move."" he said. A lot of black people were cowed and put down, so they rarely spoke up for themselves, thankfully my mother was not like that. ""We cannot afford to move, surely the estate agency should be held accountable if no one wants someone living in that house. Now if you're not willing to help, I'll tell you what to do."" ""What?"" asked the officer. ""Drive me home."" Said my mother. We were driven home by the police in a cart pulled by horses. There were bells on the cart that would clang. Clang, clang, clang. Everyone came out of their houses to see what the noise was over. My mother stood up and spoke to everyone. She told them that we had no money, we had paid rent for a month (we had to pay in advance), we didn't know what would happen in a month but we couldn't leave before then. She told them that we were different from them but that didn't give them a reason to treat us badly. After that my father became ill, but the neighbours were as nice as they could be to us."

I didn't know where my mom was, I was only 10, but I guess she had gone shopping in the Fifth. It's a Jewish quarter and they stay open all hours, you know, to make money. I found my mom and told her what had happened. She found a policeman, who was Irish, and said that the Irish were dangerous and he couldn't do anything. My mom asked him to take her to the police station where they still had wagons pulled by horses. She found the commissioner who asked her if I'd seen who dunnit. I hadn't and he said there was nothing he could do. They don't like black people round here. My mom was strong and didn't accept that. She told the commissioner to take her home in the police wagon. When they got back to fourth street she stood on the steps of the wagon and said 'Look here I've paid my rent for a month, its all we have and we are not moving. If you want us to move then give us a months rent'. They didn't have any money either. Then dad came back and became sick. They were nice to him and cared for him."

She then left to the store to tell her mother what had happened. While doing that, the policeman came, and she tried to explain what had happened. He told them that they had to move, the neighborhood is Irish, and they don't want people of color. The mother said that they would not move just because they are black. The policemen then took them home and all the neighbors came out when they saw the police horses and heard the bell. The mother addressed them and told that if they wanted her gone, they would have to give her money, otherwise she is not going anywhere.

Some people began to throw stones through the windows of the house they had rented. She took the other children into the stairway and told them to stay there because they would be safe from flyin' glass. She left the house, and prayed, not knowing if they would throw things at them. She found her mother shopping and explained what had happened. A police officer came over and asked. He said that the neighbourhood was bad and they were likely Irish. He was also Irish. He said he couldn't do anything. Her mother asked what precinct he was from and he told her, although the narrator didn't remember. Likely on Fifth. The captain was told the story and also said he couldn't do anything because the girl didn't see who threw the stones, and it was likely a number of people. Both the original police officer and captain suggested the family move out, because black people were not welcome there. But her mother refused, as they didn't have any more money, having rented the home for one month with all their money. She told the Captain to take them home in the Police Patrol, which had a clanging bell and was pulled by horses. As they got home a crowd had gathered. Her mother came out the long door in the back and confronted the crowd, saying that despite being a different colour she was the same as them and was staying at least a month, couldn't afford new windows, and if they wanted her to leave they had to give her enough money to go live somewhere else. The crowd did not do so. While they lived there, her father got sick, and the neighbours were very helpful and friendly. But her welcome to the neighbourhood had been terrifying."

The mother argues that she already paid this month's rent and doesn't have money to pay for rent elsewhere. The mother states that this is their home for the month, even if it might not be in the next (because where will the money come from). The mother even says that she doesn't have the money to pay to replace the windows that were shattered by the stones, which will be rough given that it is the winter time. However, the apartment is still home and unless people give her money to leave then this is where she will be for the month. For the narrator this was a traumatizing experience."
