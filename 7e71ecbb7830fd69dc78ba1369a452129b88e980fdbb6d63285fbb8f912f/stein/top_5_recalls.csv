64e7dcdda57ceb0c4584ffe5,"A family moved to an Irish neighbourhood on a street called Wharton. One day when the father was out tending to the horses and the mom was out shopping, someone started throwing stones through the windows. The 10 year old child of the family told the other kids to hide so they wouldn't be hurt. The child then ran out to fifth street to search for their mom. Upon finding the mom, the mom then talks to a police officer and asks for help. The officer, who is also Irish, says that there is nothing he can do and implies that moving out of that neighbourhood is the best course of action. Unsatisfied with this answer, the mom goes to the police station to talk to someone higher up. She is received better here, but is still told nothing can be done because she didn't see who threw the stones. The officer gives the mom a ride back home in a carriage with the clanging bells. The mom then addresses the neighbourhood and tells them they will be there for at least the next month and so they should be more accepting of them.",1026,102.14632419389,0.1
5a5f945176d1c60001ab7e30,"We moved onto Third and Wharton. My father drank a lot. When he took the team of horses, used to move us in, back, he then didn't return. My mother left the house to buy some food from the Jewish shop as they stayed open all hours. I was in charge of the children. I was ten years old. After my mother and father left, there was an almighty crash. A stone had been thrown through the window. I told the children to hide in the stairwell so that they wouldn't be injured. The house was stoned. I ran out of the house to find my mother. When I was telling her what happened, a policeman heard me. He said it was a rough area and that the Irish didn't want black people there, though he didn't say black. My mother asked him what he was going to do. He said there was nothing he could do and we should move. He was Irish too. My mother said we had spent the money on rent for a month so couldn't move. She asked him where his station was. We went there to see the captain but he said the same. The captain wasn't used to a black woman standing up for herself as most were cowed by the white people. She made him bring us home in the police patrol, which was a cart with horses. It was 1925. At the house, she told the people waiting that she would be there for the month as she had paid the rent and that, apart from being black, she was the same as them. Later, my father became ill. The neighbours were helpful.",1410,221.49174222298996,0.16
5fdb96141295b80008c31eb3,"This black family moved from a Jewish to an Irish neighbourhood. When they arrived someone stoned their windows. As the father was drunk, the narrator ran to find the Mum who they thought would know how to resolve the situation given her schooling at Lackanawny. The 'Mom' sought and found a policeman on the street. He said he would like to help but there was nothing he could do even though, or in spite of, he was Irish too. So they went to the station on 5th and explained the situation, how they had the windows stoned, how it would make their place unbearable in the cold of winter as they had no money to fix it. The police at the station also said there was nothing they could do but did offer her a ride back in the police wagon, a wagon still driven by horses even though it was 1925. They were thankful she accepted as she talked long and hard. Clang, Clang clang went the bells as they went down the street which caused all the neighbours to come onto the street upon the wagon's arrival to see what the fuss was about. The mother took the opportunity to explain to those gathered that she had used all the family money to pay a full months rent so she was staying the month, in these cold winter days she was, colour aside, just like them in that she wanted to put a roof over her children's head and if the locals didn't want them there because they were black then they'd have to provide the money for them to move on. Naturally, this didn't happen, as likely the locals were in the same financial predicament. However after this episode they became much friendlier, helping out wherever possible in times of need such as when the drunken father became ill.",1672,127.11112605760995,0.08
5716a297c5aca200128d2c52,There is a family that just moved to a rental house on Third and Wharton. The story is told from the perspective of a child aged 10 and set around 1925 so there are horses and carts. The father was a drunk and had to go out and get the horses. The mother left the house and came back on that day. When the whole family was in the house a stone came crashing through the window and broke it. There were people outside throwing stones at the house. The narrator gathered the younger children in the stairway so they would not be harmed and the mother ran out of the house. The narrator followed. They went to fourth street because that was a Jewish neighbourhood where things were open late and there were horses and carts. They came across a policeman who was Irish. He said it is a bad neighbourhood and an Irish one. He said they don't want black people living there and that is why the stone was thrown at the window and told the mother they should just move. The mother and narrator walk to the precint on fifth street where the policeman worked. She spoke to another police who told her the same thing and she should move. She said that they do not have the money and they gave all their money for rent and the least he could do was take them home. The policeman took them in a police horse and cart with a large bell on it. So all the neighbours came out of their homes to see it. The mother then tells them how she has no money and will definitely be there for the month but maybe not longer if they cannot afford the next months rent. She tells the crowd that they can give her money to move if they don't want them there but they do not give money. The father becomes ill during this and the neighbours act nice and help. The mother said they cannot afford to fix the window and it is cold.,1798,215.21697618570997,0.12
