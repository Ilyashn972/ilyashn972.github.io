Just after moving in the mother decided she had to pop out for some shopping, so off she went. The father then decided he had to out too. So the children were left alone in new home, all by themselves. Suddenly rocks and stones were being thrown at the front room windows. The child took her brothers and sisters and hid under the stairs. When the noise stopped she took out the children and went to find the policemen. When the mother was located she was very angry and spoke to a policeman who told her she needed to move house, however the mother argued that she had no money to move house. She asked the policeman to take them home. On arriving home the neighbours all came out of their homes to look at who was being driven home by the police. The mother then explained the situation she was in. If the neighbours wanted the family to leave they must all give her money to do so. She went onto explain that she wanted to make a home for her family just like themselves, even though her family had different coloured skin to them they were just the same as any other family."

Someone smashed a window in the family's home. It was an Irish area. They didn't want any Black people there. The mother called the police. They would not do anything. So the mother went to the police station to complain. Again the police said they could do nothing. They had no evidence. When the mother got back from the station, she said to the neighbours that no matter what they did, she and her family would be staying there for at least a month. She had paid for a month. She could not afford to move again unless the people paid her to leave. This is something they would not do. They probably could not afford to do. In the end, it turned out ok.

She explained that she had just moved in and had done so using a real estate agent who had been happy to take her money and she now had no money with which to move. She then insisted that they be taken home by the police patrol. Upon arriving at the house they were greeted by the neighbours who she assumed had thrown the brick. She addressed them and explained that she could not afford to repair the windows and that winter was coming and requested a stop to this.

A policeman came and said that he could do nothing it was a bad neighbourhood Irish and they did not like black people. We should move out. My mother who was educated and had finished High School said she had only just moved in and could not afford to move out. She wanted to know where the precinct was. The Captain she spoke to said that he could do nothing. My mother said that one thing they could do is give us a lift home in a police wagon. We went back in a police wagon that went clank, clank, clank pulled by horses. When we got home my mother addressed the crowd saying that she had only just moved in and had paid the rent so had nothing left. If they want her to move out they should pay her rent.

The older child quickly ran with the younger children and hid them and told them to stay there as it was safe from glasses and them being hurt. The older boy was very frightened but he bravely went out to go look for his mother. He knew his mom went to a local shop at long street that opens for long hours to get maximum profit. When he got there he tried explaining to his mom what happened when a policeman noticed the commotion. He went to them and asked what the matter was. The child explained everything and the policeman told him there's nothing they could do as it is an Irish neighborhood. He also told her that they would not even know who to put the blame on as they didn't know who threw the stone. He told him the best thing he thinks they should do is move out. The mother was upset and told the man he is not going to do that because she used the last money she had on paying rent. The mother asked the policeman to be taken home and the man escorted them back home. When they got home they found a crowd facing her house. When they were heading to their new place the mom faced the crowd and told them she has nowhere else to go and has no money to move out but if they had money they can contribute to move them out. She told them she is just as the same as them besides the color of her skin and it should not matter. During their time there the father got sick and the neighborhood was extremely nice but the child still remembers the first day as very frightening."

He's alone and his mom is at the market and stones start to fly through the windows. He hides his siblings under the stairs and runs out to the market to find his mother. She approaches a police officer who tells her that black people aren't welcome in Irish neighborhoods, and that there's nothing he can do. She tells him that she will go to the precinct and find someone who can help. The man recalls her mother as being unusual among black people of the time in that she was not afraid to confront authority or people in uniforms. When she talks to the police chief at the precinct he repeats the same advice- to move and that he can't help her as she hasn't identified the suspect. She tells him all her money has gone to rent and she can't afford to move. She asks for a ride home, and the officer agrees. She confronts her neighbors, tells them she's paid for a month and can't afford to move anywhere else, and that she will not be moving, and can't afford new windows. She reminds the neighborhood that she's fundamentally the same as them despite her difference in color- that she's trying to look after her family and make ends meet."
