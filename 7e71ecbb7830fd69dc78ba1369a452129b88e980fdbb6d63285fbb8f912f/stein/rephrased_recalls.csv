The youngster and their mother voice their grievances to the officer regarding the incident; the officer points the finger at the Irish district, himself being of Irish descent, and suggests it's because they disapprove of African American neighbors. He expresses his inability to intervene, prompting the mother to demand a visit to his station, and to converse with his superior officer. The superior officer likewise professes helplessness in the matter, leading the mother to request transportation back in the squad car. They are let off in the vicinity of their abode, the sound of the car attracts the attention of their neighbors, and she speaks to the gathered crowd, declaring that if they reject her family's presence, they ought to finance their relocation, since she lacks the means to do so, and they will remain there for a minimum of a month. From that point on, the neighbors show them kindness, particularly when the child's father falls ill, yet the child retains the recollection of that intimidating introduction to the community.",1591,0.053648159813922056
64ac5569f232b08a6da326bd,"The story is told from the perspective of a 10-year-old child. The family, a mom, dad, and 2 - 3 children (not sure if it said), had just moved into a house in a predominately Irish area. The dad went out to check on the horses, while the mom went to the store down the road (on Fifth) that was run by Jewish people and open 24 hours. When the kids were home alone, somebody(ies) threw a rock into one of their windows. At this time, the narrator explains how they put their siblings into a room or closet nearby and told them that they would be safe there. The narrator then runs to the store their mom went to and starts explaining what was happening. A police officer arrives and they explain to the police officer what has happened. The police officer tells them that this neighborhood is Irish and that they do not like the new family living in that house because they are black. Since this was 1925, there has been A LOT of outward racial prejudice, racism, and oppression. The police officer told them to move, to which the mom had made him aware that they did not have enough money to move and that they spent all their money on the rent for this new place. The mom then asked to go to the precinct where this officer works and the officer took the mom and child to the precinct. Here, the mom spoke with another officer (possibly a supervisor) about the situation and got a pretty similar response. She reiterated that she had to spend all of the money paying for rent upfront. She also states that they should not have rented to her if they did not want her there and that the realtor should be liable. The police officer also asked the child if they saw the face of the person who threw the rock, to which the kid did not and the police officer stated they cannot do anything without anyone to blame. With this, the mom asked the officer to give them a ride home. The officer took them home in a horse and buggy with bells on it. The bells were being rung as they arrived home (making a ""clang"" sound, as described) and the neighbors were outside watching. The mom and child were let out, walking down the steps from the buggy/carriage to peering eyes. The mom then addressed people in the neighbourhood letting them know that the family will be there for the month since they have already paid, that they do not have enough money to move, and don't know if they will even have enough money for next month's rent. She then posited that if they do not want them to live there, they can raise the funds themselves to move them out. The narrator then continues to explain that nobody raised the funds themselves, speculating that they don't have the money either and that the neighbors were being as ""normal"" or ""typical"" as one can hope. We also learn that the father falls ill.",2787,0.06,"Narrated through the eyes of a child aged ten, The household, consisting of a mother, father, and 2 to 3 kids (the exact number was unclear), had recently settled into a new home in a predominantly Irish neighborhood. The father left to tend to the horses, meanwhile, the mother visited a nearby store on Fifth Avenue, which was Jewish-owned and operated around the clock. During a time when the children were unsupervised, an individual or individuals hurled a stone through one of the windows. At that moment, the storyteller describes how they ushered their siblings into an adjacent room or closet, assuring them of their safety. Subsequently, the storyteller dashed to the store their mother had gone to, urgently recounting the incident. Upon the arrival of a law enforcement officer, they recounted the events to him. The officer informed them that the locals were Irish and harbored animosity towards the new residents because of their African American heritage. Given that the year was 1925, the era was rife with blatant racial bigotry, discrimination, and subjugation. The officer suggested that they relocate, to which the mother responded by pointing out their financial constraints, having invested all their funds into the house's rent. The mother then requested to be taken to the station where the officer was stationed, and he complied, escorting both mother and child. There, the mother conversed with another officer, possibly a superior, and received a response echoing the first. She emphasized that all their money had gone towards the initial rent payment. She further argued that if their presence was unwelcome, the responsibility should fall on the real estate agent who leased them the property. The officer also inquired if the child had seen the assailant's face who threw the stone, to which the child replied in the negative, prompting the officer to state that without a suspect, no action could be taken. Following this, the mother requested a ride back from the officer. They were then transported back in a horse-drawn carriage adorned with bells. As they made their return, the bells clanged conspicuously, drawing the attention of the onlooking neighbors. The mother and child alighted from the carriage, met by the scrutinizing gaze of the onlookers. Addressing the neighborhood, the mother declared their intention to remain for the month due to the rent being prepaid, their lack of funds for moving, and uncertainty about affording the following month's rent. She then suggested that if the community desired their departure, they should collect the necessary funds to facilitate their move. The narrator goes on to reveal that no one offered to gather the funds, hypothesizing that the neighbors lacked the means as well and that their behavior was as 'normal' or 'expected' as could be anticipated. It is also disclosed that the father became sick.",2892,0.04068196224794951

Upon our arrival, a crowd had gathered outside our door. My mother took the opportunity to speak to them. She disclosed the exorbitant rent we were paying.

5fcfc5d2efeec61409aa6cf7,"It happened in 1925. The narrator was 10. The father was day drinking and out of the house, after he'd moved their furniture into the house. The mother was out shopping. A rock crashed through the windows of the house. The children hid in the hallway to avoid the glass. The oldest of the children ran out of the house to Fourth Street, where the mother was. There, they found a policeman. He told them that this was a bad neighbourhood, and that they should move. He was Irish. The mother told him that they didn't have any money to move, and they had just moved into the house. He said there was nothing he could do. She was a smart black woman, the only one in her family to have finished high school. She asked where the nearest police station was, so that she could ask someone who would be able to do something. At the station, she got the same answer: that there was nothing to be done, except move. She then told them there was one thing they could do: to drive them home in the patrol car. They did. The car made such a clanging noise that all of their neighbours came out of their houses to see what was happening. When she got out of the police car, the mother announced to the neighbours that she knows she looks different due to having different skin colour, but that they could only afford to stay in the house a month. Perhaps they would get enough money to afford to stay another month, but in the meantime, the neighbours only had to put up with them for a month. She didn't know who threw the rock, she told them, but it was winter and it was cold, and she couldn't afford new windows. She said that she had no money to move right away, but if they wanted, the neighbours could give her the money to move. They didn't do that, but afterwards, when the father got sick, they were kind and courteous to the family.",1830,0.11,"The event took place in the year 1925. At that time, the storyteller was a decade old. Their father was indulging in alcohol during the daytime, away from home, having recently shifted their belongings into the residence. Meanwhile, the mother was engaged in shopping. Suddenly, a stone shattered the residence's windows. To steer clear of the shattering glass, the offspring concealed themselves in the corridor. The eldest sibling bolted from the dwelling to Fourth Street, in search of their mother. There, they encountered a law enforcement officer. He informed them that the area was notorious for trouble, and recommended that they relocate. His heritage was of Irish descent. The mother explained that they lacked the funds for relocation, and that they had only just settled into this new home. He expressed his inability to assist them. She was an intelligent African American woman, the sole member in her family to have completed secondary education. She inquired about the location of the closest police precinct, intending to seek help from someone who might be able to intervene. At the precinct, she received a familiar response: that there was no action to take, other than to consider relocating. She then suggested they could at least escort them home in a squad car. They complied with her request. The vehicle emitted such a raucous din that it drew all the neighbors from their homes to investigate the commotion. Upon exiting the patrol vehicle, the mother addressed the onlookers, acknowledging her distinct appearance due to her skin color, yet explaining that their financial constraints limited them to a month's stay in the home. She expressed hope for securing enough funds to extend their stay for an additional month, but for the interim, the neighbors would only need to tolerate their presence for four weeks. She admitted ignorance regarding the identity of the rock-thrower, but highlighted the harsh winter conditions and their inability to replace the broken windows. She declared her lack of immediate funds for relocation, suggesting that if the neighbors wished, they could contribute financially to facilitate their move. The neighbors refrained from offering monetary assistance, yet in the future, when the father fell ill, they showed kindness and respect towards the family.",2318,0.07701035212268766

They were scared that they were going to get hit by something. She finally met her mother. She was that upset she could barely make out what she was saying. A passing police officer stopped to talk and find out what was wrong. Her mother was very assertive, which was not common among black people of the day. The policeman had said there was nothing he can do. And that it was an irish neighbourhood that was known for trouble. He advised her to move house. The policeman was also irish. She recalled of how she though her mother was educated and that she finished high school. She went to lakawana high school and finished in 1925. The mother wasnt happy with the policemans response. She asked what precinct he worked out of. The mother went to the precinct on fifth street and spoke to the captain. She recalled of seeing lots of police patrols and horses. The captain was equally unhelpful. Saying that because they never seen who threw the stones there is nothing they can do. The mother spoke loud and long. The captain hadnt dealt with someone like this before. The mother then asked for a police patrol to give her a lift home. When she got home there was a crowd waiting for her. She spoke to the crowd.

The father had also left the residence. While they were away, the narrator, who was ten years old at the time, remembered hearing the sound of stones shattering the windows. They shifted to different areas within the home to seek protection. Subsequently, they dashed out of the dwelling. They harbored fears of being struck by an object. Eventually, she reunited with her mother. She was so distraught that she struggled to comprehend her mother's words. An officer on patrol paused to inquire and understand the issue at hand. Her mother spoke with conviction, a trait not typically seen in black individuals of that era. The officer stated there was nothing within his power to do. He mentioned it was an Irish district notorious for disturbances. He suggested that relocating would be advisable. The officer himself was of Irish descent. She remembered thinking her mother was well-educated, having completed high school. She attended Lakawana High School, graduating in the year 1925. The mother was dissatisfied with the officer's reply. She inquired about the precinct where he served. The mother approached the precinct on Fifth Street to converse with the captain. She recollected observing numerous police patrols and equine units. The captain proved to be just as uncooperative. He stated that without witnessing the stone-thrower, their hands were tied. The mother expressed her concerns vociferously and at length. The captain had never encountered someone of her demeanor before. The mother then requested a police escort back to her residence. Upon her return, she was greeted by a gathering of people. She addressed the assemblage. She informed them that the rent was prepaid for the upcoming month. And that they lacked the financial means to relocate. She declared that aside from her skin color, she shared similarities with them.

The mother left the house and came back on that day. When the whole family was in the house a stone came crashing through the window and broke it. There were people outside throwing stones at the house. The narrator gathered the younger children in the stairway so they would not be harmed and the mother ran out of the house. The narrator followed. They went to fourth street because that was a Jewish neighbourhood where things were open late and there were horses and carts. They came across a policeman who was Irish. He said it is a bad neighbourhood and an Irish one. He said they don't want black people living there and that is why the stone was thrown at the window and told the mother they should just move. The mother and narrator walk to the precint on fifth street where the policeman worked. She spoke to another police who told her the same thing and she should move. She said that they do not have the money and they gave all their money for rent and the least he could do was take them home. The policeman took them in a police horse and cart with a large bell on it. So all the neighbours came out of their homes to see it. The mother then tells them how she has no money and will definitely be there for the month but maybe not longer if they cannot afford the next months rent. She tells the crowd that they can give her money to move if they don't want them there but they do not give money. The father becomes ill during this and the neighbours act nice and help.

This tale unfolds through the eyes of a ten-year-old child, taking place in 1925, featuring horses and wagons. The patriarch, known for his drinking, had the task of fetching the horses. The matriarch departed from the residence and returned that same day. As the entire family was indoors, a rock shattered the window as it came hurtling through. Individuals were outside, hurling rocks at the dwelling. The storyteller corralled the younger siblings into the stairwell for their safety, while the mother dashed out of the home. The storyteller pursued her. Their destination was Fourth Street, a Jewish district known for its late-night activity and the presence of horses and wagons. They encountered an Irish constable. He remarked that the area was troublesome and predominantly Irish. He explained that the locals rejected the presence of black residents, which led to the window assault, and advised the mother to consider relocating. The mother and the child made their way to the precinct on Fifth Street, where the officer was stationed. She conversed with another officer who echoed the sentiment that they should find a new place to live. She expressed their financial constraints, having spent all their funds on the rent, and implored that the least he could do was escort them home. The officer escorted them home using a police horse-drawn carriage adorned with a prominent bell. This spectacle drew the neighbors out of their houses to observe. The mother then informed the onlookers about her financial plight, stating her intention to stay for the month but uncertain about future rent payments. She suggested to the crowd that they could contribute funds for their relocation if their presence was undesirable, yet no one offered money.

After my mother and father left, there was an almighty crash. A stone had been thrown through the window. I told the children to hide in the stairwell so that they wouldn't be injured. The house was stoned. I ran out of the house to find my mother. When I was telling her what happened, a policeman heard me. He said it was a rough area and that the Irish didn't want black people there, though he didn't say black. My mother asked him what he was going to do. He said there was nothing he could do and we should move. He was Irish too. My mother said we had spent the money on rent for a month so couldn't move. She asked him where his station was. We went there to see the captain but he said the same. The captain wasn't used to a black woman standing up for herself as most were cowed by the white people. She made him bring us home in the police patrol, which was a cart with horses. It was 1925. At the house, she told the people waiting that she would be there for the month as she had paid the rent and that, apart from being black, she was the same as them. Later, my father became ill.

After returning the horse-drawn team that helped with our move, he failed to come back. My mom stepped out to purchase groceries from the Jewish store since it was open at all times. The responsibility of looking after the younger ones fell to me. At that time, I was merely ten years of age. Once both my parents had departed, a tremendous noise erupted. Someone had hurled a rock through our window. I instructed the kids to take cover in the stairway to avoid getting hurt. Our residence was pelted with stones. I dashed from the home in search of my mother. As I recounted the incident to her, a police officer overheard. He commented on the neighborhood's toughness and the Irish's aversion to black residents, using a different term for 'black'. My mother inquired about his plans to address the situation. He admitted his inability to help and suggested we relocate. He shared the same Irish heritage. My mother explained that our rent was paid for the month, so moving wasn't an option. She questioned him about the location of his police station. We proceeded to his station to speak with the captain, who echoed the officer's sentiment. The captain was unaccustomed to a black woman asserting herself, as many were intimidated by whites. She insisted he escort us back in the police wagon, drawn by horses. The year was 1925. Back at our dwelling, she declared to the onlookers that she would remain for the month since the rent was paid, and that she was no different from them, save for her skin color.

There was a huge crash and a stone came through the window. I took the others under the stairs and I said you stay there, I'm gonna get Mam, we called our mother mam in those days. I knew she would be shopping somewhere on fourth because there were shops there and they kept open late because they - jews - wanted to make as much as they could. I found her there and told her. There was a policeman there and my voice was so low and shaky that he asked what the problem was. My mother told him and asked him what he could do. I can't do nothing, he said the Irish don't like a black living there - he didn't use the work black, it wasn't used then. So what can i do, my mother said. You'll have to move he said. I can't move she said, I don't have any money. I paid rent in advance so I just can't move. Why did they let me rent it if they don't want us there. Where is your precinct. He told us and we went there. Captain, she said, what can you do. Nothing he said, I'm Irish too, all you can do is move. I can't move she said. I'll tell you one thing you can do for us, take us there in your horse and wagon. He said yes, probably he just wanted to get rid of this woman. He hadn't seen anyone like her before. She was the only black woman I knew who had finished High School. We sat in back of the carriage and the bell went Clang clang. You know those trams go Clang, well this went Clang Clang Clang. When we got to the house the policeman opened the long back door and we had to walk down the steps. A crowd was looking at us. My mother said. I can't afford to move from here for a month because I paid rent in advance. It's winter and cold. I can't afford to new windows. I'm just like you except for skin wise. I am just the same. So they just accepted us from then on and when my father got sick they all helped and treated us just like one of them.

Suddenly, there was an enormous collision and a rock penetrated the windowpane. I ushered the rest beneath the staircase and instructed them to remain there, declaring my intention to fetch Mam, which was our affectionate term for mother at that time. I was certain she'd be at the shops on fourth street since that's where the stores were located, and they were open until late because the Jewish shopkeepers aimed to maximize their earnings. I located her there and informed her of the situation. A law enforcement officer was present and my voice trembled so softly that he inquired about the issue. My mother explained to him and questioned what actions he could take. There's nothing I can do, he admitted mentioning the Irish's disapproval of a black resident there - he didn't say 'black', as the term wasn't used back then. So what are my options, my mother inquired. You must relocate, he suggested. That's impossible, she protested, I lack the funds. I've already paid the rent upfront, so relocating isn't an option. She questioned why they rented to her if they didn't want her there. Where is your police station located? He provided us with the location and we made our way there. Captain, she inquired, what assistance can you offer? Nothing, he replied, I'm of Irish descent too, your only choice is to relocate. Relocation is not an option, she reiterated. However, there's one thing you could do for us, transport us in your horse-drawn vehicle. He agreed, likely wishing to be free of her presence. He had never encountered someone quite like her. She was the sole black woman I knew who had completed High School. We occupied the rear of the wagon while the bell sounded Clang clang. Similar to the trams' Clang, ours echoed Clang Clang Clang. Upon arriving at our residence, the officer swung open the lengthy rear door compelling us to descend the steps. An assembly of onlookers observed us. My mother declared. I'm unable to afford relocating for a month since the rent is prepaid. The season is winter, and it's frigid. I don't have the means for new windows. I'm akin to you, save for the color of my skin. In essence, we are alike. From that point forward, they began to accept us and they extended their help when my father fell ill and embraced us as one of their own.

He said he couldn't do anything. Her mother asked what precinct he was from and he told her, although the narrator didn't remember. Likely on Fifth. The captain was told the story and also said he couldn't do anything because the girl didn't see who threw the stones, and it was likely a number of people.

She told the Captain to take them home in the Police Patrol, which had a clanging bell and was pulled by horses. As they got home a crowd had gathered. Her mother came out the long door in the back and confronted the crowd, saying that despite being a different colour she was the same as them and was staying at least a month, couldn't afford new windows, and if they wanted her to leave they had to give her enough money to go live somewhere else.

Exiting the house, she offered a prayer, uncertain whether they would be targeted with projectiles. She located her mother amidst her shopping errands and recounted the incident.

He admitted his inability to intervene. Her mother inquired about his precinct affiliation and he disclosed it, though the narrator couldn't recall it. Presumably near Fifth Avenue. Upon hearing the account, the captain also admitted his helplessness, citing the girl's inability to identify the stone-throwers and suggesting it was the act of several individuals. Both the initial officer and the captain recommended that the family relocate, citing the area's hostility towards African Americans.

Her mother emerged from the rear elongated door and faced the assembly, declaring that despite their skin color differences, she was akin to them and intended to stay for at least the duration of the lease, unable to afford replacement windows, and stated that if they wished her to vacate, they needed to provide sufficient funds for relocation.

I was in the house with the children and people started throwing rocks through the window and there was a big crash. I realised what was happening and put the children under the stairs to shelter there. Mother had gone to fourth street to buy food at the market. It was a jewish market and they were open all hours to make as much money as they could. I decided to go find her at the market, I didn't know what was going to happen when I got outside so I said a prayer and then ran all the way there.

While I was there a policeman walked by and stopped to see what was happening and we told him. Mother said what are you going to do about it and he said the only thing to do is to move. She said I'm not going to move because I only just moved there. He said it's an Irish neighbourhood and they dont want any black people there. Well he didn't say black, he just said they don't want anybody there. She asked him what precinct he is from to find someone else who would help us and he told us but I can't remember where it was. We went there and spoke to the captain and said what are you going to do about it and he said nothing and said you have to move, same as the other policeman. Mother said well I know one thing you can do and that is to take us home. The policeman took us back to the house from about 5th street and when we got there he got out and helped mother down from the door.

The market was run by Jewish merchants who kept their business open around the clock to maximize earnings. I made up my mind to seek her out at the marketplace, unsure of what awaited me upon leaving the house so I whispered a prayer before dashing off to the market. Upon arrival, I located her and attempted to explain the events but my agitation rendered my speech incomprehensible. As I stood there, a police officer passed by and paused to inquire about the commotion to which we explained the situation. Mother questioned him on what actions he would take to which he responded that relocation was the sole option. She retorted that moving was not an option as she had recently settled in. He explained it was a predominantly Irish area and they were unwelcoming towards African Americans. To be clear, he didn't explicitly mention race, simply stating they didn't want anyone there. She demanded to know his precinct to seek assistance from someone else and he disclosed it, though I've since forgotten the details. We approached the precinct and conversed with the captain demanding to know his plan of action to which he replied indifferently echoing the previous officer's advice to relocate.

My mother had gone to the store to get some groceries on Fourth, not long after my mom, we call mother mom had gone to the store and my father had gone out there was stones being thrown at our house, I quickly moved my siblings to hide under the stairwell, I told them ""Do not move because you will be safe here and no stone will hit you"". I was very frightened but prepared myself to go look for my mother, but was not sure what would happen immediately I stepped through the door and ran to Fourth as that's where the carts where being pushed, I looked for my mom and found her and while trying to explain what had happened, a police officer happened to pass by, so after I composed myself a bit, I explained to him what had happened and all he could say to my mother and I was ""You have to move"" the town is Irish, my mom being angry and asked how he could say something like that and explained we had only moved here recently and she doesn't have money to move again. The officer said he could not do anything as it sort of a norm here as we are black, he didn't say black because they didn't say that then but that's basically what he meant, the officer was Irish as well. My mom angrily asked for his station and to speak to the captain. We went over to the police station which wasn't too far from where we were, it was on Fifth. We entered and demanded to speak to the captain, we explained the situation and he basically said the same thing as the police officer. I was surprised and impressed by my mom, she stood her ground as she was more educated having gone to school in nineteen twenty-five. She explained to the captain that we have only moved here and have no money to go someplace else, and he said there was not much he could do as there was no one to blame, he also asked me if it was possible that there have been multiple people, which would make it harder to but the blame on someone. My mother suggested arresting the real estate agents as they sold the property to her despite knowing the situation in the town. My mother then said the least they could do was to drop off home and since the captain was tired of us being there because the conversation was long and loud he agreed. We went into the station patrol vehicle that had a bell attached to it and made a  ""Clang clang clang"" sound as we moved, during the journey, due to the bell a number of people came out of their homes to watch what was going on. When we reached our house, my mom turned to address the people watching, she said we had just moved here and paid money for rent for the month and that we were going to stay for the month and that after that she didn't know, she also told them apart from the colour of their skin they were all the same people and that they should get used to us being here. She also suggested that if they all really wanted us to leave they should donate money for the family to move somewhere else, which they didn't because they probably didn't have any money either. After that day, everyone seemed to be nicer and even when my dad was sick they helped and offered whatever they had just like anyone else would.

Meanwhile, my mother had left for the market on Fourth to purchase provisions, just after my mom, whom we affectionately refer to as mother, had departed for the market, and as my dad made his way outside, someone began hurling rocks at our residence, I swiftly ushered my brothers and sisters to take cover beneath the stairs, instructing them, ""Stay put because this spot will shield you from any stones."" I was filled with terror, yet I steeled myself to search for my mother, uncertain of the consequences the moment I would exit the doorway, and hurried towards Fourth since that's where the carts were usually stationed, I sought out my mother and successfully located her, and as I was in the midst of recounting the events, we chanced upon a passing policeman, so once I regained my composure somewhat, I recounted the incident to him, to which he could only advise my mother and me, ""You need to relocate."" the community is predominantly Irish, my mother, incensed, questioned how he could make such a remark, and she clarified that we had just recently settled in the area, emphasizing that she lacked the financial means for another move. The officer admitted his inability to intervene, citing it as a local custom since we were African American, he didn't explicitly say 'black' because that term wasn't used then, but that was the implication, the officer himself was of Irish descent too. My mother, in a state of agitation, demanded the officer's precinct and a meeting with the chief. We proceeded to the nearby police station, which was situated on Fifth Street. Upon arrival, we insisted on a conversation with the captain, who essentially echoed the sentiments of the patrolman. I was both shocked and proud of my mother, as she asserted herself with the education she received back in 1925. She informed the captain that our relocation was recent and we lacked the resources for another move, and he responded that his hands were tied since there was no specific individual to hold accountable, he even inquired if the culprits were numerous, complicating the assignment of blame. My mother proposed the arrest of the realtors for knowingly selling us the property amidst the town's climate. She then argued that the least they could do was provide us a ride home, and the captain, weary from our prolonged and heated discussion, consented. We boarded the station's patrol wagon, equipped with a bell, which resounded with a ""Clang clang clang"" as we proceeded, and the bell's clamor drew curious onlookers from their homes along the way. Upon our arrival, my mother addressed the gathered crowd, declaring that we had recently arrived and paid our rent for the month, and that we intended to remain for the duration of that month, beyond which she was uncertain of our plans, she also reminded them that beneath the skin color, we were all fundamentally alike, and that they should become accustomed to our presence. She further suggested that if they truly desired our departure, they should contribute funds to facilitate our relocation, which they did not, likely due to their own financial constraints. From that day forward, the community's demeanor improved towards us, and they extended assistance and offered what they could when my father fell ill, just as any neighbor would.

I'm going to try to find mom."" (We called our mother ""Mom"".) I was only 10 years old at the time. I was so scared walking towards the front door, I didn't know what I would see. There were shops nearby, in the Jewish neighbourhood. They were open all hours because they tried to take what money they could get. That's where my mother was. There were carts on the street. I ran up to my mother and started telling her what happened. A police officer went past. I was so scared I could hardly be understood. The police officer stopped, he wanted to find out what had happened and what was wrong with me. He started speaking to my mother. ""You're in a bad neighbourhood. There's nothing anyone can do for you, the people there are Irish."" He was Irish himself. ""They don't want black people living there."" But he didn't say black. ""They don't want anyone in that house, you should move."" ""We can't move."" My mother said. ""We don't have any money. If you can't do anything then tell me where your precinct is."" We went to the police station where the officer worked. We spoke to another police officer there. ""You should move."" he said. A lot of black people were cowed and put down, so they rarely spoke up for themselves, thankfully my mother was not like that. ""We cannot afford to move, surely the estate agency should be held accountable if no one wants someone living in that house. Now if you're not willing to help, I'll tell you what to do."" ""What?"" asked the officer. ""Drive me home."" Said my mother. We were driven home by the police in a cart pulled by horses. There were bells on the cart that would clang. Clang, clang, clang. Everyone came out of their houses to see what the noise was over. My mother stood up and spoke to everyone. She told them that we had no money, we had paid rent for a month (we had to pay in advance), we didn't know what would happen in a month but we couldn't leave before then. She told them that we were different from them but that didn't give them a reason to treat us badly. After that my father became ill, but the neighbours were as nice as they could be to us.",2438,0.13,"Our new residence became the corner of Third and Wharton. As I've mentioned before, my father had a habit of drinking, which led him to leave the house. Meanwhile, my mother departed to purchase groceries, which left me in charge of the children. Shortly after her departure, a loud bang echoed through the house. I noticed rocks penetrating the window. I quickly gathered the children and concealed ourselves beneath the staircase. I instructed them, ""Remain here, you're out of harm's way in this spot. I'll attempt to locate mom."" (We affectionately referred to our mother as ""Mom"".) At that time, I was merely a 10-year-old. Filled with fear, I made my way to the entrance, uncertain of the scene that awaited me. There were stores in the vicinity, situated in the Jewish district. They operated around the clock, seizing any opportunity to earn. That was my mother's destination. Carts lined the streets. I approached my mother hastily and began recounting the incident. A policeman strolled by. My fear was so intense that I was barely comprehensible. The officer halted in his tracks, eager to understand the situation and to ascertain my distress. He initiated a conversation with my mother. ""This is a rough area. No one can assist you here, the locals are of Irish descent."" The officer himself was of Irish heritage. ""They're opposed to black residents in their neighborhood."" However, he didn't use the term 'black'. ""They don't want occupants in that dwelling; it would be wise for you to relocate."" ""We're unable to relocate,"" my mother responded. ""We're devoid of funds. If you're powerless to aid us, then direct me to your station."" We proceeded to the precinct where the officer was stationed. There, we conversed with a different officer. ""You ought to consider moving,"" he suggested. Numerous black individuals were intimidated and oppressed, hence they seldom stood up for themselves, fortunately, my mother was an exception. ""Relocating isn't within our financial means; the real estate agency must be held responsible if the property is undesirable. If you refuse to provide assistance, then I'll instruct you on your next steps."" ""And what might that be?"" inquired the officer. ""Escort me back to my home,"" my mother demanded. The police escorted us home in a horse-drawn carriage. The carriage was adorned with bells that jingled. Jingle, jingle, jingle. The clamor drew neighbors out of their homes to investigate. My mother rose to address the crowd. She explained our lack of financial resources, our prepaid rent for the upcoming month, our uncertainty about the future beyond that month and our inability to vacate the premises until then. She acknowledged our differences from them but emphasized it was no justification for mistreatment. Subsequently, my father fell ill, yet the neighbors showed us as much kindness as they could muster.",2870,0.08667202322054703
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,"We moved to Third and Whardoff. My father went out - did I tell you he drank? And my mother went to the store to get some things for our home. When my father left people began throwing stones - stones flying through the window. Of course, I was left at home with the children. So I rushed them to the stairway, because that was the only place where they wouldn't get hit by flying glass. Once they were there I said ""You stay here, I am going to get mom"" (We called our mother mom). I ran out the door and didn't know what to expect. I ran to Fourth. The neighbourhood was Jewish, and so the stores stayed open until late. Any bit of money they could earn, they did. When I reached my mother I couldn't make sense in what I was saying. A passing policeman heard the commotion and wanted to find out why I was in such a state. Once he found out, he told my mother that the neighbourhood is Irish, and that we should move out because we're black. He didn't say 'black' but he said ""They don't want somebody living there"". My mother said to him that she had spent all of her savings on that months rent, and didn't have enough to move. She said ""You're civil service, you must protect us"". He said that he couldn't do that - he was Irish too. My mother asked ""Where is the precinct you work"". He told her, but I don't remember the exact details, even though I was standing with my mother. We went to the precinct and spoke to the head officer, but he told my mother the same thing ""Move away"". She explained the situation to him, but he said he couldn't help. She finally said ""The least you can do is drive me home"". So he did. The police car, hors and cart, mad a clanging sound. Clang clang clang. As we turned the corner - the precinct wasn't far, maybe on Fifth - everyone turned and came out of their homes to hear the noise. The policeman sat up front, and we were let out the wide back door of the cart. As my mother got out she turned to face all the people and asked ""Why do you do this to me? We are the same, maybe not color wise, but in every other respect, we are the same. I have spent all of my savings on moving here. We are living here for a month at least, I don't have enough to move away. I am just trying to provide a home for my family. I don't have enough money to fix my windows, so unless you want to get together and pay for me to move, I am staying for a month"". Of course they didn't pay, but during that month, my father got sick. The people were as sweet as can be.",2493,0.13,"Our new residence was at the corner of Third and Whardoff. My dad left the house - have I mentioned his drinking habits? Meanwhile, my mom headed to the market to pick up a few household necessities. As soon as my dad departed, individuals started to hurl rocks - projectiles shattering our windows. Naturally, I was tasked with looking after the kids at home. I quickly herded them towards the staircase, as it was the sole safe haven from the shards of glass. Having secured them, I instructed, ""Remain here, I need to fetch mom"" (We referred to our mother as mom). Bolting through the entrance, I was uncertain of what awaited me. I sprinted towards Fourth Street. The district was predominantly Jewish, hence the shops were open until the wee hours. They seized every opportunity to make an extra dime. Upon finding my mother, my words were jumbled and incoherent. An officer on patrol overheard the uproar and sought to understand my distressed state. After he was informed, he cautioned my mother that the area was Irish-dominated, and suggested we relocate because of our race. He didn't explicitly say 'black,' but implied, ""They don't want your kind here"". My mother responded that she had exhausted her savings on the current month's rent and couldn't afford another move. She implored, ""As a public servant, it's your duty to protect us"". His reply was that he couldn't intervene - he shared the same Irish heritage. My mother inquired, ""Which precinct do you serve at""? He disclosed the location, but the precise details escape me, even though I was beside my mother. We approached the precinct and conversed with the commanding officer, who echoed the advice to relocate. Despite her detailed explanation, he remained unhelpful. In the end, she requested, ""At least offer us a ride back home"". And so, he complied. The police vehicle, alongside the horse and cart, created a resonant din. Clang, clang, clang. As we rounded the bend - the station was close, perhaps on Fifth - the entire neighborhood emerged to investigate the clamor. The officer was seated at the front, and we alighted from the spacious rear of the wagon. Stepping out, my mother faced the crowd and questioned, ""Why do you target me? We may differ in skin tone, but in all other ways, we are alike. I've invested all my savings into this move. We're here to stay for at least a month; I lack the funds for another relocation. All I want is to provide a stable home for my loved ones. I can't afford to repair these windows, so unless you're willing to contribute to my moving costs, I'm here to stay for the duration"". They didn't contribute, yet in that month, my father fell ill. The locals turned unexpectedly kind-hearted.",2710,0.09116149061441695
