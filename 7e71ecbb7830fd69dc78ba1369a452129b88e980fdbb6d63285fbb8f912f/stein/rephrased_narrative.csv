75,"An' he says, “I'm sure there was more than one person.”"," He added, ""I'm certain it wasn't just one individual involved."""

88,And they had never come up with anybody like that., They had never encountered someone like her before.

103,"and faced all those people that were standing around,"," to address the crowd that had gathered,"
104,"and she says, “Why you're doing this to me I don't know.”"," and she declared, “I can't fathom why you're treating us this way.”"
105,"She says, “I know that I am different from you, color wise,"," She continued, “Yes, our skin colors may differ,"
106,"but in every other respect I'm just the same as you are,"," but aside from that, I am no different from any of you,"

108,"She told them that they had rented the house,"," She explained that they had leased the property,"
109,"she told them how much money she had paid,"," disclosed the amount of rent she had paid,"

112,She knew she was going to be there for the month., She was certain they would stay there for that duration.
113,She did not know beyond the month.," Beyond that month, she was unsure."
114,Whether they'd have enough money to pay it for the next month., Whether they could afford the rent for the following month was uncertain.

116,"She said, “It is winter time and it is cold."," She pointed out, “It's winter, and it's bitterly cold."

120,And now I'm telling you that we're going to be here for a month., And I want you all to understand that we will be here for the month.”
121,So you might just as well make up your mind to that.," Therefore, you should come to terms with this reality."
122,"If you don't want me here then you people get together and give me enough money to move somewhere else, because I do not have it.”"," If my presence here is unwelcome, then I suggest you all pool your resources and provide me with the funds to relocate, as I currently lack the means."
123,Well of course you know they didn't do that.," Naturally, they did not comply with this request."

125,"So in the meantime – not in the meantime but during, during the period of time that we were there, my father became sick."," Meanwhile, or rather during our time there, my father fell ill."

127,When there was trouble they responded just like anyone else., They came to our aid during times of distress just like anyone would.
