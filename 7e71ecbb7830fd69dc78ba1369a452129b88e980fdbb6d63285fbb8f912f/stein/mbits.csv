My mother told the office in charge that the police should protect them. He asked if my mother had seen the face of anyone throwing stones. She said she hadn't, so the officer asked how he could punish anyone if he didn't know who to punish. My mother asked him to drive us home, so he did.

There were police patrollers around who kind of understood what the ten year old was trying to say and they warned the mom about the area. They advised her to move to another area, as that area was not ""good for them"", and according to them people like them(blacks) were not welcomed in the area. The mother told the patrol that there's no way that they can move because they had just moved in and paid rent, and the people took their money. The mom insisted that the police help them and they told her that there's nothing they can do. She went to the station with them and asked them to take them home, which they did.

One day when the father was out tending to the horses and the mom was out shopping, someone started throwing stones through the windows. The 10 year old child of the family told the other kids to hide so they wouldn't be hurt. The child then ran out to fifth street to search for their mom. Upon finding the mom, the mom then talks to a police officer and asks for help. The officer, who is also Irish, says that there is nothing he can do and implies that moving out of that neighbourhood is the best course of action. Unsatisfied with this answer, the mom goes to the police station to talk to someone higher up. She is received better here, but is still told nothing can be done because she didn't see who threw the stones. The officer gives the mom a ride back home in a carriage with the clanging bells. The mom then addresses the neighbourhood and tells them they will be there for at least the next month and so they should be more accepting of them.",23.32,3.38,-4.0,5.01,4.72,6.7,-2.61,-0.43,3.05,4.93,10.3,0.61,0.36,9.99,1.53,0.29,3.01,2.46,-0.57,0.15,-0.6,1.18,0.02,-4.86,2.73,5.38,-0.23,-1.01,-2.36,0.07,-0.16,1.41,1.9,-0.31,1.3,6.49,-1.52,-0.17,-2.15,2.3,1.81,3.92,-0.42,1.35,-0.48,3.02,-1.68,1.5,0.78,0.27,0.44,2.4,2.97,0.57,2.62,-1.03,-1.12,2.48,-0.14,1.57,-3.98,0.17,-0.04,0.48,0.06,-0.1,2.73,-2.76,-0.76,-1.88,-0.89,2.64,0.47,0.77,-2.19,1.24,-1.82,-1.17,-0.59,-2.16,0.44,-2.46,-0.63,4.85,-2.89,-0.47,-1.62,-4.92,-0.33,-1.56,2.57,5.99,1.31,2.51,-0.99,-1.87,-2.84,3.18,-1.06,0.0,-0.36,0.25,2.77,-5.53,-0.31,-0.42,-0.61,2.27,-0.38,-0.1,3.89,2.83,-0.2,1.31,0.92,-0.58,-0.68,0.19,-1.78,5.91,0.05,-2.77,-1.15,0.77,-2.41,1.09,0.94,1.8,-0.6,-0.78

The child's mother had gone to the shop and the child's father had gone to tend the horses. While the parents were away the house was stoned. The child tried to make their siblings safe and then left the house to find their mother. They found the mother at the shop and while trying to communicate to her what had happened they were overheard by a policeman. The mother asked the policeman for assistance but he replied there was nothing he could do. He suggested that the family should move to another area (there appears to have been issues with racism in the neighbourhood). The mother advised that moving was unaffordable and went with the child to the police station to seek assistance. At the police station the mother confronted another police officer and asked for assistance. The officer declined to investigate as no suspects had been identified. The officer was not prepared to make any effort to investigate or find the criminals. The mother is described as being educated, having completed high school and despite experiencing prejudice and discrimination was not afraid to try and secure her basic rights. The mother requested that she and her child were transported back to the property in the police vehicle. The police vehicle was a horse drawn cart with a bell. On arriving at the property the mother and child exited the police vehicle and the mother addressed her neighbours who had gathered nearby.

They were a black family who rented in an irish neighborhood for a month. The boy's father went to attend the horses outside. The mother went to fourth street which is a market. The boy was home alone with just his younger siblings. He heard a loud noise crashing through the window. The loud crash was a rock that was thrown through the window. The boy managed to keep his siblings protected from the window glass by standing on the staircase. He was scared and ran outside to find his mom at fourth street. When the boy found his mother there was surprisingly a policeman passing by. He managed to explain the story of what happened to the policeman and his mother. The policeman was understanding but mentioned that there was nothing he could do to help. Probably due to the racial segregation existing at those times. The mother was relentless and opted to go to the nearest police station to find someone to help with this matter if this policeman can't. She went to the police station where they told her the same thing and suggested she moved out. She mentions she can't move out because she paid the rent for the month with her last money. She asked the policeman take her home in his carriage instead. When she arrived she told the irish people in the neighborhood if they want her to leave they must collectively contribute enough money for her to move out because she doesn't have any money left over to move out.

63e52debbbb982734deba89a,109.48,0.05,"A black family had recently moved into a new neighbourhood of predominantly Irish people. This was in the 1920s. The father went out (he tended to drink) and left his wife and children at home. It was evening time. The mother needed to go and get some food so went out to the Jewish shop that stayed open longest. She told the eldest child who was 10 to look after the younger children. Suddenly there was a crash that scared the children greatly. The eldest hurried the children under the stairwell for protection and told them to stay there and that they would be safe. A stone had been thrown through their house window. The child was scared but went out to find their mother, correctly guessing where she would be and told her what had happened. She was angry and aggrieved at the unfairness of it. They were black but they paid their rent like everyone else. If they didn't want them there why had they allowed them to rent. There was a policeman passing and the mother stopped him asking for him to come and help find who had done this. Although he was sympathetic to a degree he said the only thing he could suggest was that they moved somewhere else. The mother said she had paid the rent for a month and there was no way she would move. Her job as a mother was to protect her children. The child was proud of his mother who was educated and strong. As the policeman would not help she asked to be taken to someone more senior who could help. Again the answer was that all that they could suggest was that she move. She and the child were taken in the horse drawn police wagon back home. The clanging of the bell alerted the neighbourhood who came out to watch what was happening. The mother alighted and spoke to them saying that apart from the colour of their skin they were all the same. She had paid rent for a month and she was staying for a month. If they wanted to move her they could pay her rent to live elsewhere. A while later the father became ill and the people in the neighbourhood behaved towards the family with kindness and empathy.",5.82,2.31,4.76,4.08,5.32,-4.18,2.12,-0.86,2.94,3.7,10.43,0.53,-2.33,10.23,3.43,5.1,1.16,2.25,0.35,0.08,-0.02,0.66,-0.48,-4.09,1.21,3.97,-1.71,-0.9,0.49,6.52,-0.45,2.52,-0.72,-0.13,-0.1,7.16,-1.22,-0.79,-1.39,2.0,-0.17,0.24,-0.54,0.72,-2.52,-1.77,3.14,-3.53,0.07,2.84,-0.13,1.37,-0.38,-0.5,-0.19,-2.36,-0.91,2.33,-1.19,1.16,-3.35,-0.63,8.12,-0.5,3.53,-0.66,7.21,-2.43,0.92,-1.49,3.5,-3.14,0.07,0.43,-0.29,-0.94,2.17,-3.58,-1.1,6.74,-0.59,-3.95,-1.19,3.78,-2.37,-1.35,-0.25,-2.72,0.28,-0.55,-0.11,5.31,1.56,1.91,-0.55,1.07,-0.93,0.36,-1.2,0.55,-0.76,-1.0,2.42,1.43,2.43,1.6,-1.49,4.77,-0.16,-1.35,5.98,2.24,-0.38,1.06,1.04,-1.12,-2.46,-0.87,-0.4,1.71,-1.16,3.77,-2.02,0.3,8.94,3.73,1.65,-0.16,-0.85,-0.5

He and his family had just rented a house and moved their furniture in. It was an Irish neighbourhood and not integrated. They must have been the first black family that had tried to live there. The father and the mother had had to go out separately on errands. This left the narrator to look after his siblings. Suddenly a rock came through the front window. This was followed by a shower of other stones. The narrator hid his siblings on the stairs where they would be safe from flying glass. He went out to find his mom. His mom was shopping in the Jewish neighbourhood a little way away. He was telling his mom about the attack. A policeman came by and heard their conversation. The policeman, who was Irish himself, said that he couldn't do anything. This was especially since the narrator didn't know who had attacked them. The policeman said that the only thing they could do was move out of the neighbourhood. The mother stood up to the policeman. She said she could not move for lack of money. They had paid a month's rent in advance. Perhaps the real estate agent should not have rented them the house? Then they went to the police station. The other policemen were equally unhelpful. They advised them to move out. But the police drove them home. The whole neighbourhood saw them arrive in the police wagon. The mother then explained to the neighbours that she realized they were different. She couldn't move because it was winter. She had no money to go anywhere else.

One day they come home, and after their parents go out (their father to fetch some horses, their mother to shop at the local Jewish market which stays open late), someone throws a stone through the window of their home, smashing the glass and scaring the child and their siblings. They go to find their mother, and encounter a policeman. The child and their mother complain to the policeman about what happens; the policeman blames the Irish neighbourhood, being Irish himself, and attributes it to them not wanting Black neighbours. He says he can't do anything about it, so the mother insists on attending his precinct, and speaking to his captain. The captain also claims not to be able to help, so the mother asks him to drive them home in the patrol vehicle. They're dropped off near their home, the noise of the vehicle draws out their neighbours, and she addresses them all, telling them that if they don't want her and her family there, they should pay for them to move house, as she can't afford it, and will be there for at least a month. Thereafter, the neighbours are kind to them, especially when the child's father is sick, but the child holds onto the memory of that frightening welcome to the neighbourhood.",9.71,3.2,-1.92,3.87,9.43,7.11,-1.81,-1.31,3.37,3.39,14.0,1.13,-2.65,1.93,-1.3,-1.05,0.13,3.13,0.45,0.36,-0.65,1.94,0.16,-5.6,1.02,3.4,-1.03,-0.58,1.76,6.43,0.6,2.08,0.75,-0.58,3.08,6.36,-0.9,-1.18,-1.27,0.56,1.18,6.33,2.18,-2.39,0.57,2.14,3.36,-2.84,0.71,3.69,-0.09,4.43,3.57,0.64,7.46,-0.98,-0.73,1.53,-0.12,-2.43,-1.24,-0.06,0.94,0.02,5.49,0.83,-2.11,2.21,0.88,0.99,1.56,-2.5,0.14,0.62,-1.77,0.37,3.19,-1.14,-0.4,0.21,-0.03,1.65,-0.57,5.1,0.44,3.05,-0.52,-2.49,0.12,-0.02,2.57,3.54,-1.2,1.47,-0.61,1.77,-2.0,0.95,-0.61,1.24,-0.4,0.24,3.4,-3.03,-0.36,-0.66,-0.6,3.24,0.05,0.47,3.55,1.58,0.19,1.31,0.68,-1.14,1.21,-2.53,-0.04,1.33,-1.84,8.94,-2.13,0.63,7.51,5.83,-2.08,4.16,-0.02,1.12
64ac5569f232b08a6da326bd,159.11,0.06,"The story is told from the perspective of a 10-year-old child. The family, a mom, dad, and 2 - 3 children (not sure if it said), had just moved into a house in a predominately Irish area. The dad went out to check on the horses, while the mom went to the store down the road (on Fifth) that was run by Jewish people and open 24 hours. When the kids were home alone, somebody(ies) threw a rock into one of their windows. At this time, the narrator explains how they put their siblings into a room or closet nearby and told them that they would be safe there. The narrator then runs to the store their mom went to and starts explaining what was happening. A police officer arrives and they explain to the police officer what has happened. The police officer tells them that this neighborhood is Irish and that they do not like the new family living in that house because they are black. Since this was 1925, there has been A LOT of outward racial prejudice, racism, and oppression. The police officer told them to move, to which the mom had made him aware that they did not have enough money to move and that they spent all their money on the rent for this new place. The mom then asked to go to the precinct where this officer works and the officer took the mom and child to the precinct. Here, the mom spoke with another officer (possibly a supervisor) about the situation and got a pretty similar response. She reiterated that she had to spend all of the money paying for rent upfront. She also states that they should not have rented to her if they did not want her there and that the realtor should be liable. The police officer also asked the child if they saw the face of the person who threw the rock, to which the kid did not and the police officer stated they cannot do anything without anyone to blame. With this, the mom asked the officer to give them a ride home. The officer took them home in a horse and buggy with bells on it. The bells were being rung as they arrived home (making a ""clang"" sound, as described) and the neighbors were outside watching. The mom and child were let out, walking down the steps from the buggy/carriage to peering eyes. The mom then addressed people in the neighbourhood letting them know that the family will be there for the month since they have already paid, that they do not have enough money to move, and don't know if they will even have enough money for next month's rent. She then posited that if they do not want them to live there, they can raise the funds themselves to move them out. The narrator then continues to explain that nobody raised the funds themselves, speculating that they don't have the money either and that the neighbors were being as ""normal"" or ""typical"" as one can hope. We also learn that the father falls ill.",11.93,3.02,-2.37,4.26,5.86,6.38,-1.31,-0.35,2.4,3.27,12.1,0.1,-0.61,4.82,1.7,2.84,-0.63,1.61,-0.01,0.56,-0.7,1.06,0.39,-5.94,2.12,2.76,-3.33,-3.58,2.38,5.95,-1.72,0.67,-1.25,-0.96,3.9,4.54,0.46,-0.2,-0.61,0.96,2.85,6.28,-1.78,0.29,-0.84,1.52,4.48,-3.04,-0.28,1.38,-0.33,1.55,-1.43,-0.43,7.73,-1.81,-0.95,3.12,-1.33,-1.94,-5.56,0.56,1.25,-0.23,6.25,-0.13,4.42,-3.29,0.43,-0.15,0.93,4.55,0.22,2.85,-0.67,-0.31,3.21,4.48,-1.25,14.58,12.61,-3.13,-1.43,5.16,-4.49,-0.95,-2.48,-5.38,-0.03,-1.06,3.29,6.5,-0.5,1.67,-1.64,-0.67,-1.89,3.79,-1.4,1.84,0.21,-0.73,2.36,-6.18,-1.53,-1.07,0.64,5.35,1.55,-0.11,4.99,3.96,1.03,8.34,0.33,-1.2,-3.69,-2.78,1.01,5.76,-1.34,6.78,0.14,4.95,8.93,2.34,1.12,0.07,-1.07,-0.51

One night when the narrators father, who drinks, is out tending the horses and their mother has gone to the shop the house has stones thrown at the windows and the window breaks. The narrator who is only 10 years old, takes their younger siblings into the stairwell to protect them from flying glass. They are all very scared by the experience and the narrator has to go and find their mom, which is what they call their mother. The narrator knows to go to 4th Street where there is a Jewish shop that is open late. (The narrator comments that they want to make as much money as they can so open all hours) The narrator finds mom and tells her what has happened. At the same time a policeman hears the story as the narrator is talking loudly and asks what has happened. The policeman is told and is asked what he is going to do. He replies that they will not be welcome in an Irish neighbourhood and he can do nothing about it, it is said he is Irish himself. Mom asks his precinct and goes there to complain and see what the captain will do about the incident, to which the Captain explains that if the narrator did not see who threw the stones they cannot know who is to blame. The mom then asks to be taken home in the patrol wagon and the Captain agrees. The narrator comments that her mom is educated and the only person they knew at the time with a high school diploma. The narrator mentioned that it was 1925 but I am not sure if that was the date of the incident or when mom graduated high school. the whole neighbourhood come out to the sound of the patrols clanging bell and mom tells everyone that although they are a different skin colour, she and her family are the same in every other way and she only wants to take care of her family just like they do. She has paid all the money she has upfront to live in the house and If they don't want the family there they can give her the money and she will happily move, of course no one offers and the narrator comments that no one would have that sort of money in any case. The narrator tells us that the neighbours were always kind and considerate to them and when her father got sick they were helpful and kind.",14.88,0.78,4.03,3.68,3.12,8.75,-1.12,-0.88,3.99,3.54,6.58,-0.75,1.54,15.51,-0.34,0.26,2.26,7.14,0.1,0.34,0.67,0.87,0.0,-6.43,1.94,6.02,1.87,-0.82,3.03,7.87,9.52,-0.62,0.77,-0.86,5.03,6.74,1.49,-0.41,0.7,1.07,-0.97,5.14,-2.09,-0.93,-3.91,-0.44,3.73,-1.66,0.75,1.64,-0.68,2.96,5.6,-0.4,9.49,-0.59,-0.68,0.18,-0.6,-5.29,-4.39,-0.83,17.18,-0.43,9.75,-0.47,0.78,6.47,-3.06,-4.31,-0.73,2.91,0.28,0.81,-1.33,0.25,1.28,1.75,-0.71,5.51,-1.43,-1.27,-1.12,5.85,-0.84,4.72,-1.11,-1.65,-0.58,-0.26,-1.62,4.87,0.92,1.06,-1.0,2.52,-2.11,0.85,-1.85,-0.26,-0.68,-0.85,2.97,0.61,5.32,2.4,2.84,4.25,3.24,-0.36,-0.52,-0.17,-1.3,0.11,-1.1,-0.76,-2.27,0.09,0.87,-0.73,-0.73,1.41,1.81,2.24,7.03,7.86,-0.28,1.43,-0.79,0.32

The mother was out shopping. A rock crashed through the windows of the house. The children hid in the hallway to avoid the glass. The oldest of the children ran out of the house to Fourth Street, where the mother was. There, they found a policeman. He told them that this was a bad neighbourhood, and that they should move. He was Irish. The mother told him that they didn't have any money to move, and they had just moved into the house. He said there was nothing he could do. She was a smart black woman, the only one in her family to have finished high school. She asked where the nearest police station was, so that she could ask someone who would be able to do something. At the station, she got the same answer: that there was nothing to be done, except move. She then told them there was one thing they could do: to drive them home in the patrol car. They did. The car made such a clanging noise that all of their neighbours came out of their houses to see what was happening. When she got out of the police car, the mother announced to the neighbours that she knows she looks different due to having different skin colour, but that they could only afford to stay in the house a month. Perhaps they would get enough money to afford to stay another month, but in the meantime, the neighbours only had to put up with them for a month. She didn't know who threw the rock, she told them, but it was winter and it was cold, and she couldn't afford new windows. She said that she had no money to move right away, but if they wanted, the neighbours could give her the money to move.

When they were out of the house the storyteller who was ten at the time, recalled of stones smashing the windows. They moved to other parts of the house for safety. Then ran out of the house. They were scared that they were going to get hit by something. She finally met her mother. She was that upset she could barely make out what she was saying. A passing police officer stopped to talk and find out what was wrong. Her mother was very assertive, which was not common among black people of the day. The policeman had said there was nothing he can do. And that it was an irish neighbourhood that was known for trouble. He advised her to move house. The policeman was also irish. She recalled of how she though her mother was educated and that she finished high school. She went to lakawana high school and finished in 1925. The mother wasnt happy with the policemans response. She asked what precinct he worked out of. The mother went to the precinct on fifth street and spoke to the captain. She recalled of seeing lots of police patrols and horses. The captain was equally unhelpful. Saying that because they never seen who threw the stones there is nothing they can do. The mother spoke loud and long. The captain hadnt dealt with someone like this before. The mother then asked for a police patrol to give her a lift home. When she got home there was a crowd waiting for her. She spoke to the crowd.

5716a297c5aca200128d2c52,209.9,0.12,There is a family that just moved to a rental house on Third and Wharton. The story is told from the perspective of a child aged 10 and set around 1925 so there are horses and carts. The father was a drunk and had to go out and get the horses. The mother left the house and came back on that day. When the whole family was in the house a stone came crashing through the window and broke it. There were people outside throwing stones at the house. The narrator gathered the younger children in the stairway so they would not be harmed and the mother ran out of the house. The narrator followed. They went to fourth street because that was a Jewish neighbourhood where things were open late and there were horses and carts. They came across a policeman who was Irish. He said it is a bad neighbourhood and an Irish one. He said they don't want black people living there and that is why the stone was thrown at the window and told the mother they should just move. The mother and narrator walk to the precint on fifth street where the policeman worked. She spoke to another police who told her the same thing and she should move. She said that they do not have the money and they gave all their money for rent and the least he could do was take them home. The policeman took them in a police horse and cart with a large bell on it. So all the neighbours came out of their homes to see it. The mother then tells them how she has no money and will definitely be there for the month but maybe not longer if they cannot afford the next months rent. She tells the crowd that they can give her money to move if they don't want them there but they do not give money. The father becomes ill during this and the neighbours act nice and help. The mother said they cannot afford to fix the window and it is cold.,30.11,1.14,4.65,5.95,7.78,8.34,0.45,-1.34,3.47,2.18,10.61,1.39,2.11,15.83,-2.07,-0.21,-1.07,2.4,-2.08,0.8,-1.55,1.36,-0.23,-4.45,0.95,2.85,3.04,1.46,5.16,6.55,-0.99,0.1,0.99,-0.6,2.7,5.12,-1.35,-0.75,-1.18,1.09,6.53,7.28,-1.55,-0.83,-0.66,0.65,8.53,-1.97,0.24,1.65,-0.41,1.17,2.14,-0.76,7.91,-1.76,0.47,0.86,-0.38,-2.03,-4.99,-0.22,0.69,-0.09,5.85,-0.4,7.93,-3.61,0.85,-0.54,1.75,-2.23,0.2,-0.08,0.08,0.7,1.88,5.78,-1.57,2.53,-0.88,-0.05,-1.24,5.93,-0.29,-0.66,-1.97,-4.77,0.05,-1.57,0.34,4.32,0.38,1.98,-0.56,2.34,-1.62,-1.54,-1.97,-0.44,-0.49,-0.64,1.62,-0.01,-0.86,-0.65,0.07,4.87,2.01,1.41,4.79,4.15,4.82,6.28,-0.36,6.98,5.78,-3.86,1.16,2.13,-2.42,7.11,0.6,0.29,9.74,4.5,1.26,-0.2,-0.12,-0.14

There was a huge crash and a stone came through the window. I took the others under the stairs and I said you stay there, I'm gonna get Mam, we called our mother mam in those days. I knew she would be shopping somewhere on fourth because there were shops there and they kept open late because they - jews - wanted to make as much as they could. I found her there and told her. There was a policeman there and my voice was so low and shaky that he asked what the problem was. My mother told him and asked him what he could do. I can't do nothing, he said the Irish don't like a black living there - he didn't use the work black, it wasn't used then. So what can i do, my mother said. You'll have to move he said. I can't move she said, I don't have any money. I paid rent in advance so I just can't move. Why did they let me rent it if they don't want us there. Where is your precinct. He told us and we went there. Captain, she said, what can you do. Nothing he said, I'm Irish too, all you can do is move. I can't move she said. I'll tell you one thing you can do for us, take us there in your horse and wagon. He said yes, probably he just wanted to get rid of this woman. He hadn't seen anyone like her before. She was the only black woman I knew who had finished High School. We sat in back of the carriage and the bell went Clang clang. You know those trams go Clang, well this went Clang Clang Clang. When we got to the house the policeman opened the long back door and we had to walk down the steps. A crowd was looking at us. My mother said. I can't afford to move from here for a month because I paid rent in advance. It's winter and cold. I can't afford to new windows. I'm just like you except for skin wise. I am just the same.

Some people began to throw stones through the windows of the house they had rented. She took the other children into the stairway and told them to stay there because they would be safe from flyin' glass. She left the house, and prayed, not knowing if they would throw things at them. She found her mother shopping and explained what had happened. A police officer came over and asked. He said that the neighbourhood was bad and they were likely Irish. He was also Irish. He said he couldn't do anything. Her mother asked what precinct he was from and he told her, although the narrator didn't remember. Likely on Fifth. The captain was told the story and also said he couldn't do anything because the girl didn't see who threw the stones, and it was likely a number of people. Both the original police officer and captain suggested the family move out, because black people were not welcome there. But her mother refused, as they didn't have any more money, having rented the home for one month with all their money. She told the Captain to take them home in the Police Patrol, which had a clanging bell and was pulled by horses. As they got home a crowd had gathered. Her mother came out the long door in the back and confronted the crowd, saying that despite being a different colour she was the same as them and was staying at least a month, couldn't afford new windows, and if they wanted her to leave they had to give her enough money to go live somewhere else. The crowd did not do so. While they lived there, her father got sick, and the neighbours were very helpful and friendly.

5fb402a66cba9801673f2b5c,263.12,0.11,"We were at third and wharton and father had gone out and mother had gone to the market to buy some food. I was in the house with the children and people started throwing rocks through the window and there was a big crash. I realised what was happening and put the children under the stairs to shelter there. Mother had gone to fourth street to buy food at the market. It was a jewish market and they were open all hours to make as much money as they could. I decided to go find her at the market, I didn't know what was going to happen when I got outside so I said a prayer and then ran all the way there. When I got there I found her and I was trying to tell her what happened but I was so upset my voice was such that she couldn't understand. While I was there a policeman walked by and stopped to see what was happening and we told him. Mother said what are you going to do about it and he said the only thing to do is to move. She said I'm not going to move because I only just moved there. He said it's an Irish neighbourhood and they dont want any black people there. Well he didn't say black, he just said they don't want anybody there. She asked him what precinct he is from to find someone else who would help us and he told us but I can't remember where it was. We went there and spoke to the captain and said what are you going to do about it and he said nothing and said you have to move, same as the other policeman. Mother said well I know one thing you can do and that is to take us home. The policeman took us back to the house from about 5th street and when we got there he got out and helped mother down from the door. All the people were there standing outside and she said to them you all know whats happened and I don't know who did it but I do know I'm not going to move. I just moved in here and spent all my money to rent this house for a month and don't have any more money. You might as well make up your minds that I will be here for this month and if you want me to move then you all can put your money together for me. It is winter and cold and I don't have any money to be buying windows. I don't even know if I will have enough money to stay here for another month. After that the neighbours we very friendly and my dad got sick while we were living there and everyone wanted to help us and was kind. That was my introduction to the neighbourhood and it was terrifying.",29.36,2.58,-4.32,5.04,6.64,-4.17,-0.9,-0.54,3.87,6.23,14.27,0.08,0.85,9.27,-1.21,0.47,1.83,2.0,-0.97,0.65,-0.54,1.7,0.23,6.06,3.51,-0.74,5.26,-0.76,4.15,7.07,7.64,2.11,-0.29,-0.47,5.07,4.44,12.3,2.93,-0.37,2.61,-0.29,5.95,-1.32,-0.01,2.57,0.19,7.32,3.82,8.71,4.04,-0.68,1.61,-0.78,-1.67,9.6,-0.53,3.19,0.65,-0.37,2.13,-4.77,-0.84,-0.66,-0.29,0.64,1.11,-2.48,7.42,-0.5,-2.64,3.8,-3.6,-0.08,0.53,-0.16,0.12,6.28,0.82,-0.76,2.39,0.6,6.41,-0.72,5.81,-1.57,-1.5,-2.19,-2.36,-0.02,-0.49,7.78,-4.37,-1.4,0.92,-0.74,0.96,0.36,4.09,-0.98,0.28,-1.5,-0.06,2.64,-3.54,0.11,-0.01,-0.12,0.92,1.56,0.92,3.81,3.38,-0.31,1.77,-1.04,13.79,13.19,-0.83,1.3,0.65,4.63,9.12,-1.9,0.66,7.85,5.6,-0.49,5.75,1.87,-0.87
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,270.36,0.08,"We moved in to Third and Warton and not long after my dad got drunk and went out back to try and take the horses out. My mother had gone to the store to get some groceries on Fourth, not long after my mom, we call mother mom had gone to the store and my father had gone out there was stones being thrown at our house, I quickly moved my siblings to hide under the stairwell, I told them ""Do not move because you will be safe here and no stone will hit you"". I was very frightened but prepared myself to go look for my mother, but was not sure what would happen immediately I stepped through the door and ran to Fourth as that's where the carts where being pushed, I looked for my mom and found her and while trying to explain what had happened, a police officer happened to pass by, so after I composed myself a bit, I explained to him what had happened and all he could say to my mother and I was ""You have to move"" the town is Irish, my mom being angry and asked how he could say something like that and explained we had only moved here recently and she doesn't have money to move again. The officer said he could not do anything as it sort of a norm here as we are black, he didn't say black because they didn't say that then but that's basically what he meant, the officer was Irish as well. My mom angrily asked for his station and to speak to the captain. We went over to the police station which wasn't too far from where we were, it was on Fifth. We entered and demanded to speak to the captain, we explained the situation and he basically said the same thing as the police officer. I was surprised and impressed by my mom, she stood her ground as she was more educated having gone to school in nineteen twenty-five. She explained to the captain that we have only moved here and have no money to go someplace else, and he said there was not much he could do as there was no one to blame, he also asked me if it was possible that there have been multiple people, which would make it harder to but the blame on someone. My mother suggested arresting the real estate agents as they sold the property to her despite knowing the situation in the town. My mother then said the least they could do was to drop off home and since the captain was tired of us being there because the conversation was long and loud he agreed. We went into the station patrol vehicle that had a bell attached to it and made a  ""Clang clang clang"" sound as we moved, during the journey, due to the bell a number of people came out of their homes to watch what was going on. When we reached our house, my mom turned to address the people watching, she said we had just moved here and paid money for rent for the month and that we were going to stay for the month and that after that she didn't know, she also told them apart from the colour of their skin they were all the same people and that they should get used to us being here. She also suggested that if they all really wanted us to leave they should donate money for the family to move somewhere else, which they didn't because they probably didn't have any money either. After that day, everyone seemed to be nicer and even when my dad was sick they helped and offered whatever they had just like anyone else would. It was all good but my first initially welcome to that area was terrible!",28.62,0.94,3.79,4.65,8.5,3.68,-3.2,-2.52,2.81,2.9,4.21,-0.11,1.99,7.49,3.09,14.06,2.49,6.81,-0.96,0.52,1.86,2.12,-0.22,-1.12,2.04,-0.6,8.12,7.47,-2.21,-1.75,-1.62,1.92,1.54,-0.1,7.93,8.0,-0.09,0.37,-1.26,3.79,0.03,3.96,0.13,-0.89,0.72,1.37,2.8,6.65,2.03,0.87,0.09,4.34,3.63,-1.14,6.59,-2.29,-0.95,1.42,-0.99,-5.99,-4.15,-1.4,9.55,0.09,6.29,3.02,3.46,1.77,-0.46,-3.15,0.88,4.64,0.05,5.06,6.92,-2.14,3.42,-2.03,-1.86,3.63,11.2,-1.43,-1.04,4.83,-2.07,0.55,6.44,-4.54,0.7,-1.1,2.99,7.18,4.53,2.53,1.18,0.83,-2.86,-0.14,-2.63,-0.9,0.14,0.32,2.8,-0.87,2.37,1.2,-1.55,4.57,2.06,-0.1,5.23,3.35,3.87,-0.62,-0.35,-1.97,-2.83,-0.68,1.02,3.61,-0.9,9.33,0.28,8.07,6.09,6.83,4.05,5.71,3.24,-2.08
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,311.6,0.13,"We moved to Third and Wharton. I told you my father used to drink, so he went out. My mother went out to buy some food, leaving me alone with the kids. Just after she had left I heard a loud crash. I saw stones coming through the window. I grabbed the kids and hid in the stairs. I told them ""Stay here, nothing can reach you here. I'm going to try to find mom."" (We called our mother ""Mom"".) I was only 10 years old at the time. I was so scared walking towards the front door, I didn't know what I would see. There were shops nearby, in the Jewish neighbourhood. They were open all hours because they tried to take what money they could get. That's where my mother was. There were carts on the street. I ran up to my mother and started telling her what happened. A police officer went past. I was so scared I could hardly be understood. The police officer stopped, he wanted to find out what had happened and what was wrong with me. He started speaking to my mother. ""You're in a bad neighbourhood. There's nothing anyone can do for you, the people there are Irish."" He was Irish himself. ""They don't want black people living there."" But he didn't say black. ""They don't want anyone in that house, you should move."" ""We can't move."" My mother said. ""We don't have any money. If you can't do anything then tell me where your precinct is."" We went to the police station where the officer worked. We spoke to another police officer there. ""You should move."" he said. A lot of black people were cowed and put down, so they rarely spoke up for themselves, thankfully my mother was not like that. ""We cannot afford to move, surely the estate agency should be held accountable if no one wants someone living in that house. Now if you're not willing to help, I'll tell you what to do."" ""What?"" asked the officer. ""Drive me home."" Said my mother. We were driven home by the police in a cart pulled by horses. There were bells on the cart that would clang. Clang, clang, clang. Everyone came out of their houses to see what the noise was over. My mother stood up and spoke to everyone. She told them that we had no money, we had paid rent for a month (we had to pay in advance), we didn't know what would happen in a month but we couldn't leave before then. She told them that we were different from them but that didn't give them a reason to treat us badly.

When my father left people began throwing stones - stones flying through the window. Of course, I was left at home with the children. So I rushed them to the stairway, because that was the only place where they wouldn't get hit by flying glass. Once they were there I said ""You stay here, I am going to get mom"" (We called our mother mom). I ran out the door and didn't know what to expect. I ran to Fourth. The neighbourhood was Jewish, and so the stores stayed open until late. Any bit of money they could earn, they did. When I reached my mother I couldn't make sense in what I was saying. A passing policeman heard the commotion and wanted to find out why I was in such a state. Once he found out, he told my mother that the neighbourhood is Irish, and that we should move out because we're black. He didn't say 'black' but he said ""They don't want somebody living there"". My mother said to him that she had spent all of her savings on that months rent, and didn't have enough to move. She said ""You're civil service, you must protect us"". He said that he couldn't do that - he was Irish too. My mother asked ""Where is the precinct you work"". He told her, but I don't remember the exact details, even though I was standing with my mother. We went to the precinct and spoke to the head officer, but he told my mother the same thing ""Move away"". She explained the situation to him, but he said he couldn't help. She finally said ""The least you can do is drive me home"". So he did. The police car, hors and cart, mad a clanging sound. Clang clang clang. As we turned the corner - the precinct wasn't far, maybe on Fifth - everyone turned and came out of their homes to hear the noise. The policeman sat up front, and we were let out the wide back door of the cart. As my mother got out she turned to face all the people and asked ""Why do you do this to me? We are the same, maybe not color wise, but in every other respect, we are the same. I have spent all of my savings on moving here. We are living here for a month at least, I don't have enough to move away. I am just trying to provide a home for my family. I don't have enough money to fix my windows, so unless you want to get together and pay for me to move, I am staying for a month"". Of course they didn't pay, but during that month, my father got sick.
