122,"If you don't want me here then you people get together and give me enough money to move somewhere else, because I do not have it.”",72,11,61,61
40,And then when he understood what the situation was he turned to my mother,52,0,52,52
47,"He says, “But they don't want any black people in there.”",81,33,48,48
6,And my father went to take the horses – take the team of horses back.,54,100,-46,46
26,I was ten years old at the time this happened –,46,0,46,46
27,"I ran to Fourth street, because I knew my mother wa-",57,100,-43,43
102,Before the patrol ever left my mother turned,58,100,-42,42
48,An' he didn't say black 'cause they didn't use black then.,39,0,39,39
53,He was Irish himself.,58,22,36,36
65,"And this was – let me see what year was this happening – well it must have been nineteen twenty-five, so you can see what – what the times were.",36,0,36,36
79,In that house you had to pay in advance.,35,0,35,35
116,"She said, “It is winter time and it is cold.",45,11,34,34
5,"and after he had gotten in and put the furniture where it was supposed to go, my mother left, to go to market to get some food to bring into the house.",66,100,-34,34
111,And they had paid that rent for a month.,55,22,33,33
117,And I cannot afford to be buying windows.”,42,11,31,31
72,"He says, “Because” – he said to me, “Did you see anyone?”",30,0,30,30
14,And I had sense enough to get the kids into the stairway so that they wouldn't get hurt by flyin' glass.,71,100,-29,29
2,We had gotten moved,29,0,29,29
89,So they put us in the police patrol,71,100,-29,29
74,"He says, “Well how can – how can you” – to my mother – “how can you do anything if you don't know who – who to put the blame on?”",40,11,29,29
73,"And I said, “No.”",28,0,28,28
104,"and she says, “Why you're doing this to me I don't know.”",50,77,-27,27
38,"I was so nervous and – and – my voice was shaking so,",37,11,26,26
49,But “they don't want anybody in there.”,26,0,26,26
86,"She said, “Yes in the police patrol.”",51,77,-26,26
87,So – I guess they figured “Let's get this lady out of here because she's talking loud and long.”,26,0,26,26
113,She did not know beyond the month.,57,33,24,24
80,"And she said, “If they didn't want me there they should not have rented the house to me.",46,22,24,24
37,And my voice was such that you could hardly make out what I was saying.,35,11,24,24
67,And they also had police wagons with horses attached to them. Believe it or not in those days.,24,0,24,24
1,We moved down to Third and Wharton.,76,100,-24,24
30,and they – they stayed open until – until all hours.,24,0,24,24
118,"“Now” she said, “Whoever threw the stones I don't know.",34,11,23,23
33,And I finally found my mother.,77,100,-23,23
119,But you can all see what has happened.,34,11,23,23
78,"They took all we had to, to pay the rent.",67,44,23,23
63,And she – well I always thought of her as an educated person which she was because she was the only one I knew who had completed high school.,34,11,23,23
13,And then of course they – they – well they stoned the house.,88,66,22,22
12,And I – and I looked and it was a big stone.,78,100,-22,22
41,"and says, “This is a bad neighborhood.",78,100,-22,22
54,“I can't do anything about it.”,44,22,22,22
21,"I was scared to death,",44,22,22,22
10,And of course I was left there with the kids.,54,33,21,21
103,"and faced all those people that were standing around,",56,77,-21,21
114,Whether they'd have enough money to pay it for the next month.,54,33,21,21
19,And they were crying,20,0,20,20
75,"An' he says, “I'm sure there was more than one person.”",31,11,20,20
24,but I remember saying a prayer as I went out the front door because I didn't know what was gonna hit me when I went out that door.,46,66,-20,20
107,and all I'm trying to do is provide a home for my family.”,46,66,-20,20
85,"He said, “Take you home?”",20,0,20,20
81,Now the real estate agent should be accountable.”,30,11,19,19
55,"So my mother said um, “Where is the uh precinct you work from?”",41,22,19,19
7,But he didn't come home.,25,44,-19,19
90,and they took us home.,69,88,-19,19
110,she had told them that was all the money she had.,52,33,19,19
22,I really was frightened out of my wits.,40,22,18,18
88,And they had never come up with anybody like that.,18,0,18,18
125,"So in the meantime – not in the meantime but during, during the period of time that we were there, my father became sick.",62,44,18,18
100,And they had a long door in the back where you had to come down steps to get out the back of the – of this police patrol.,29,11,18,18
76,"So my mother said, “Well I don't know what I'm going to do.”",17,0,17,17
8,"He – stopped somewhere on – I dunno,",17,0,17,17
129,And it was terrible,17,0,17,17
64,She went to Lackawanna high school.,17,0,17,17
121,So you might just as well make up your mind to that.,49,33,16,16
31,"Because they would, you know, however much money they could get they wanted.",16,0,16,16
42,It's Irish.”,71,55,16,16
106,"but in every other respect I'm just the same as you are,",61,77,-16,16
46,"He says, “I dunno.”",15,0,15,15
9,but he – how he – why he wasn't in the house.,15,0,15,15
96,And um all the neighbors came running out to see what was happening.,51,66,-15,15
123,Well of course you know they didn't do that.,26,11,15,15
45,"My mother said, “I just moved in, how am I gonna move out?”",36,22,14,14
56,And he told her.,14,0,14,14
28,"They had push carts in those days, on Fourth street.",19,33,-14,14
3,"but it was like – you remember I told you my father drank,",41,55,-14,14
127,When there was trouble they responded just like anyone else.,57,44,13,13
101,Well we got out of that police patrol –,24,11,13,13
20,and carryin' on.,13,0,13,13
83,"And he says, “What's that?”",13,0,13,13
68,"So my mother said, to the captain, “What are you going to do about it?”",43,55,-12,12
69,"And he says, “Well lady there's nothing we can do about it.”",65,77,-12,12
115,But she knew they were going to be there for the month.,56,44,12,12
60,"So uh she said, “Well if you can't do anything to help me, I'll go see who – if I can't find someone else to help me.”",45,33,12,12
108,"She told them that they had rented the house,",45,33,12,12
17,And I'm gonna go and see if I can find mom” –,65,77,-12,12
29,And it was a Jewish neighborhood,44,33,11,11
39,and he wanted to find out what ha- what was wrong with me.,55,44,11,11
61,"Well in those days black people were so cowed by circumstances an' uniforms and white people, you know, they uh many times didn't assert themselves.",22,11,11,11
43,"And he said, “They're known to do things like that,",55,66,-11,11
59,but I've forgotten where he told her.,11,0,11,11
58,I was right there with her,11,0,11,11
44,Better move out of there.”,56,66,-10,10
109,"she told them how much money she had paid,",43,33,10,10
57,I forgot now.,10,0,10,10
71,"She says – he says, “Well uh the only thing I can tell you to do is to move.”",65,55,10,10
98,"I can see it right now – from where he was sitting up front there where the horses came around,",20,11,9,9
66,"And we went – she took me, and we went to the police station.",79,88,-9,9
130,and it certainly was frightening for me.,9,0,9,9
93,they had a bell that clanged. Clang clang clang –,42,33,9,9
91,We weren't far from – from where it was – maybe Fifth street – from where we had moved.,30,22,8,8
126,And the neighbors were as nice as anybody could ever have been.,69,77,-8,8
16,Don't move 'cause nothing will reach you here.,47,55,-8,8
112,She knew she was going to be there for the month.,52,44,8,8
97,And of course they saw the man came around the back –,19,11,8,8
128,But that was our welcoming to the neighborhood.,18,11,7,7
124,They probably didn't have any money either.,18,11,7,7
105,"She says, “I know that I am different from you, color wise,",60,66,-6,6
36,a policeman went by.,72,66,6,6
4,"but it was still day,",6,0,6,6
11,Well no sooner did my mother get out of the house – my father went first – then – oh it was such an awful crash came through the window.,94,100,-6,6
18,(We call our mother mom.),6,0,6,6
23,"And I didn't know what to do,",16,22,-6,6
120,And now I'm telling you that we're going to be here for a month.,39,33,6,6
32,So uh that's where she was going to do her shopping.,28,22,6,6
52,"He says, “I can't do anything with it.”",72,66,6,6
99,and opened the door in the back.,27,22,5,5
35,And while I was trying to tell her what had happened,49,44,5,5
84,"She says, “You can take me home.”",60,55,5,5
94,you know they told you about the trolley that went “Clang.”,26,22,4,4
15,"And I said to them, “Now you stay there.",51,55,-4,4
25,And I ran –,52,55,-3,3
92,"And – course with the horses and the police patrol, and the clang –",36,33,3,3
62,But thankfully my mother was not one of those kind.,25,22,3,3
34,I did find her.,42,44,-2,2
70,"And she says, “You mean to tell me that I have to live under those circumstances and there's nothing that you can do about it?”",43,44,-1,1
77,"She says, “But one thing I know I'm not going to do is move. Because I have no money to move with.”",78,77,1,1
82,"So anyhow, she said to him, “Well I know one thing you can do.”",23,22,1,1
51,You're supposed to protect us.”,22,22,0,0
95,"Well this police patrol that bell they had, it went “Clang clang clang.”",22,22,0,0
50,"So uh, she said, “Well you're the law.",33,33,0,0
