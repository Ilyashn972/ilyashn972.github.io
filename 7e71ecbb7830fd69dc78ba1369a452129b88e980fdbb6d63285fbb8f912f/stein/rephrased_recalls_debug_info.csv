5bc0941074e76c00019e9479,3,the area was in an Irish enclave close to that of a Jewish community,situated in an Irish district adjacent to a Jewish neighborhood
5bc0941074e76c00019e9479,4,"and although the mother of the family had reported the incident to the local Police,","and even though the family's matriarch had informed the nearby police of the event,"
5bc0941074e76c00019e9479,5,without the ability to name or identify the culprits,lacking the means to pinpoint or recognize the offenders
5bc0941074e76c00019e9479,6,there were no charges brought forward,no legal actions were initiated
5bc0941074e76c00019e9479,7,The family was Afro-American,The household identified as African-American
5bc0941074e76c00019e9479,8,and living in a white Anglo-Irish American area,residing in a predominantly white Anglo-Irish American locality
5bc0941074e76c00019e9479,9,but once the Mother had confronted the neighbours with her financial plight and her circumstances,"however, after the mother addressed her financial struggles and situation with the neighbors,"
5bc0941074e76c00019e9479,10,a sense of community provided support,"a feeling of kinship emerged, offering assistance"
5bc0941074e76c00019e9479,11,when the father of the family was sick.,during the period when the family patriarch was ill.
5c0239caecc5660001424ed6,1,A Black family moved to a new neighbourhood.,A family of African descent relocated to a different community.

5c0239caecc5660001424ed6,5,The mother called the police.,The matriarch reported the incident to law enforcement.
5c0239caecc5660001424ed6,6,They would not do anything.,The officers were unwilling to take action.
5c0239caecc5660001424ed6,7,So the mother went to the police station to complain.,"Therefore, the mother visited the police department to file a grievance."
5c0239caecc5660001424ed6,8,Again the police said they could do nothing.,"Once more, law enforcement officials stated their inability to intervene."

5c0239caecc5660001424ed6,12,She could not afford to move again unless the people paid her to leave.,Moving anew was not financially feasible for her unless the residents compensated her departure.
5c0239caecc5660001424ed6,13,This is something they would not do.,This was an action they were unwilling to undertake.
5c0239caecc5660001424ed6,14,They probably could not afford to do.,"Likely, they didn't have the financial means to do so."

604a8a4926724aaed69b940b,5,at least that was what the child was complaining about.,or so the offspring lamented.

60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,11,"but prepared myself to go look for my mother,","yet I steeled myself to search for my mother,"
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,12,but was not sure what would happen immediately I stepped through the door,"uncertain of the consequences the moment I would exit the doorway,"
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,13,"and ran to Fourth as that's where the carts where being pushed,","and hurried towards Fourth since that's where the carts were usually stationed,"
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,14,I looked for my mom and found her,"I sought out my mother and successfully located her,"
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,15,"and while trying to explain what had happened, a police officer happened to pass by,","and as I was in the midst of recounting the events, we chanced upon a passing policeman,"
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,16,"so after I composed myself a bit,","so once I regained my composure somewhat,"
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,17,I explained to him what had happened,"I recounted the incident to him,"
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,18,"and all he could say to my mother and I was ""You have to move""","to which he could only advise my mother and me, ""You need to relocate."""
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,19,"the town is Irish,","the community is predominantly Irish,"
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,20,my mom being angry and asked how he could say something like that,"my mother, incensed, questioned how he could make such a remark,"
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,21,and explained we had only moved here recently,"and she clarified that we had just recently settled in the area,"
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,22,and she doesn't have money to move again.,emphasizing that she lacked the financial means for another move.
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,23,"The officer said he could not do anything as it sort of a norm here as we are black,","The officer admitted his inability to intervene, citing it as a local custom since we were African American,"
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,24,"he didn't say black because they didn't say that then but that's basically what he meant,","he didn't explicitly say 'black' because that term wasn't used then, but that was the implication,"
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,25,the officer was Irish as well.,the officer himself was of Irish descent too.
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,26,My mom angrily asked for his station and to speak to the captain.,"My mother, in a state of agitation, demanded the officer's precinct and a meeting with the chief."
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,27,"We went over to the police station which wasn't too far from where we were,","We proceeded to the nearby police station,"
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,28,it was on Fifth.,which was situated on Fifth Street.
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,29,"We entered and demanded to speak to the captain,","Upon arrival, we insisted on a conversation with the captain,"
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,30,we explained the situation and he basically said the same thing as the police officer.,who essentially echoed the sentiments of the patrolman.
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,31,"I was surprised and impressed by my mom,","I was both shocked and proud of my mother,"
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,32,she stood her ground as she was more educated having gone to school in nineteen twenty-five.,as she asserted herself with the education she received back in 1925.
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,33,"She explained to the captain that we have only moved here and have no money to go someplace else,","She informed the captain that our relocation was recent and we lacked the resources for another move,"
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,34,"and he said there was not much he could do as there was no one to blame,","and he responded that his hands were tied since there was no specific individual to hold accountable,"
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,35,"he also asked me if it was possible that there have been multiple people, which would make it harder to but the blame on someone.","he even inquired if the culprits were numerous, complicating the assignment of blame."
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,36,My mother suggested arresting the real estate agents as they sold the property to her despite knowing the situation in the town.,My mother proposed the arrest of the realtors for knowingly selling us the property amidst the town's climate.
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,37,My mother then said the least they could do was to drop off home,"She then argued that the least they could do was provide us a ride home,"
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,38,and since the captain was tired of us being there because the conversation was long and loud he agreed.,"and the captain, weary from our prolonged and heated discussion, consented."
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,39,We went into the station patrol vehicle that had a bell attached to it,"We boarded the station's patrol wagon, equipped with a bell,"
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,40,"and made a  ""Clang clang clang"" sound as we moved,","which resounded with a ""Clang clang clang"" as we proceeded,"
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,41,"during the journey, due to the bell a number of people came out of their homes to watch what was going on.",and the bell's clamor drew curious onlookers from their homes along the way.
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,42,"When we reached our house, my mom turned to address the people watching,","Upon our arrival, my mother addressed the gathered crowd,"
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,43,she said we had just moved here and paid money for rent for the month,"declaring that we had recently arrived and paid our rent for the month,"
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,44,and that we were going to stay for the month,"and that we intended to remain for the duration of that month,"
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,45,"and that after that she didn't know,","beyond which she was uncertain of our plans,"
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,46,she also told them apart from the colour of their skin they were all the same people,"she also reminded them that beneath the skin color, we were all fundamentally alike,"
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,47,and that they should get used to us being here.,and that they should become accustomed to our presence.
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,48,"She also suggested that if they all really wanted us to leave they should donate money for the family to move somewhere else,","She further suggested that if they truly desired our departure, they should contribute funds to facilitate our relocation,"
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,49,which they didn't because they probably didn't have any money either.,"which they did not, likely due to their own financial constraints."
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,50,"After that day, everyone seemed to be nicer","From that day forward, the community's demeanor improved towards us,"
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,51,and even when my dad was sick they helped and offered whatever they had just like anyone else would.,"and they extended assistance and offered what they could when my father fell ill, just as any neighbor would."
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,52,It was all good,"Things turned out well in the end,"
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,53,but my first initially welcome to that area was terrible!,yet my initial reception in that neighborhood was far from welcoming!

6116c9e9f3490c79002fda6e,8,because they would be safe from flyin' glass.,as it would shield them from the shards of glass.
6116c9e9f3490c79002fda6e,9,"She left the house,","Exiting the house,"
6116c9e9f3490c79002fda6e,10,"and prayed,","she offered a prayer,"

6116c9e9f3490c79002fda6e,24,and also said he couldn't do anything,citing the girl's inability to identify the stone-throwers
6116c9e9f3490c79002fda6e,25,"because the girl didn't see who threw the stones,",and suggesting it was the act of several individuals.
6116c9e9f3490c79002fda6e,26,and it was likely a number of people.,"Both the initial officer and the captain recommended that the family relocate,"
6116c9e9f3490c79002fda6e,27,"Both the original police officer and captain suggested the family move out,",citing the area's hostility towards African Americans.

6116c9e9f3490c79002fda6e,30,"as they didn't have any more money,",since they had invested all their money in a one-month lease.

6160c8f657e3c4094b01614a,18,"and if they want them to leave that badly they should pool together enough money so they can afford to move away,","suggesting that if the community truly desired their departure, they should collectively fund their relocation,"
6160c8f657e3c4094b01614a,19,they of course didn't do this since they are likely struggling just as much as them.,"which they did not do, presumably due to financial constraints similar to the family's."
