5fdb96141295b80008c31eb3,1,This black family moved from a Jewish to an Irish neighbourhood.
5fdb96141295b80008c31eb3,2,When they arrived someone stoned their windows.
5fdb96141295b80008c31eb3,3,"As the father was drunk, the narrator ran to find the Mum who they thought would know how to resolve the situation given her schooling at Lackanawny."
5fdb96141295b80008c31eb3,4,The 'Mom' sought and found a policeman on the street.
5fdb96141295b80008c31eb3,5,"He said he would like to help but there was nothing he could do even though, or in spite of, he was Irish too."
5fdb96141295b80008c31eb3,6,"So they went to the station on 5th and explained the situation, how they had the windows stoned, how it would make their place unbearable in the cold of winter as they had no money to fix it."
5fdb96141295b80008c31eb3,7,"The police at the station also said there was nothing they could do but did offer her a ride back in the police wagon, a wagon still driven by horses even though it was 1925."
5fdb96141295b80008c31eb3,8,They were thankful she accepted as she talked long and hard.
5fdb96141295b80008c31eb3,9,"Clang, Clang clang went the bells as they went down the street which caused all the neighbours to come onto the street upon the wagon's arrival to see what the fuss was about."
5fdb96141295b80008c31eb3,10,"The mother took the opportunity to explain to those gathered that she had used all the family money to pay a full months rent so she was staying the month, in these cold winter days she was, colour aside, just like them in that she wanted to put a roof over her children's head and if the locals didn't want them there because they were black then they'd have to provide the money for them to move on."
5fdb96141295b80008c31eb3,11,"Naturally, this didn't happen, as likely the locals were in the same financial predicament."
5fdb96141295b80008c31eb3,12,"However after this episode they became much friendlier, helping out wherever possible in times of need such as when the drunken father became ill."
6460f320e8ba103d47ded9d6,1,A family moved into a house in a new neighbourhood.
6460f320e8ba103d47ded9d6,2,"After they had moved in,"
6460f320e8ba103d47ded9d6,3,the father took the horses away
6460f320e8ba103d47ded9d6,4,and the mother went shopping.
6460f320e8ba103d47ded9d6,5,"While the narrator was at home with the other children,"
6460f320e8ba103d47ded9d6,6,their house was attacked
6460f320e8ba103d47ded9d6,7,and stones were thrown through the window.
6460f320e8ba103d47ded9d6,8,Once the narrator had hidden the children
6460f320e8ba103d47ded9d6,9,"he went to find his mother at the Jewish shop,"
6460f320e8ba103d47ded9d6,10,which stayed open late
6460f320e8ba103d47ded9d6,11,and served anyone.
6460f320e8ba103d47ded9d6,12,Once the shopkeeper had heard what had happened
6460f320e8ba103d47ded9d6,13,he told the mother that they lived in a bad neighbourhood
6460f320e8ba103d47ded9d6,14,and should leave.
6460f320e8ba103d47ded9d6,15,The mother said she couldn't leave
6460f320e8ba103d47ded9d6,16,because she had used all her money for the first month's rent.
6460f320e8ba103d47ded9d6,17,The mother went to the police to complain
6460f320e8ba103d47ded9d6,18,and they also told her to leave.
6460f320e8ba103d47ded9d6,19,It was an Irish neighbourhood in the 1920s
6460f320e8ba103d47ded9d6,20,"and, because they were black, they would never fit in."
6460f320e8ba103d47ded9d6,21,The mother insisted the police drive her home.
6460f320e8ba103d47ded9d6,22,"When she got home,"
6460f320e8ba103d47ded9d6,23,she addressed the neighbours - explaining that she had no money to move
6460f320e8ba103d47ded9d6,24,and they were stuck with her for the month
6460f320e8ba103d47ded9d6,25,and better get used to the idea.
6460f320e8ba103d47ded9d6,26,After that the neighbours were much friendlier
6460f320e8ba103d47ded9d6,27,and even helped when the father got sick.
5c8cdc31745b370017d73ece,1,The child was in the house
5c8cdc31745b370017d73ece,2,when the parents were out.
5c8cdc31745b370017d73ece,3,The father was drinking in the day time
5c8cdc31745b370017d73ece,4,and the mother was out shopping in the market.
5c8cdc31745b370017d73ece,5,They had just moved to a house on third street.
5c8cdc31745b370017d73ece,6,The children were in the house
5c8cdc31745b370017d73ece,7,when someone starting throwing rocks at the house.
5c8cdc31745b370017d73ece,8,The person telling the story ran to find his mum.
5c8cdc31745b370017d73ece,9,They spoke to a policeman
5c8cdc31745b370017d73ece,10,who said he couldn't help
5c8cdc31745b370017d73ece,11,and they would have to move.
5c8cdc31745b370017d73ece,12,The mother said they could not move
5c8cdc31745b370017d73ece,13,and asked where his precinct was.
5c8cdc31745b370017d73ece,14,They went to the precinct
5c8cdc31745b370017d73ece,15,and they said the same thing.
5c8cdc31745b370017d73ece,16,The mother insisted they drive them back to the house
5c8cdc31745b370017d73ece,17,"where she told the rest of the neighbours that if they wanted them to move, they would have to give her the money to move."
5c8cdc31745b370017d73ece,18,Nobody did.
5c8cdc31745b370017d73ece,19,The father got sick
5c8cdc31745b370017d73ece,20,and the neighbours were nice.
60479c2017ec4a044c2ed68f,1,The story was about a family that just moved into a neighborhood.
60479c2017ec4a044c2ed68f,2,They were black.
60479c2017ec4a044c2ed68f,3,They had troubles with the people in the neighborhood who were throwing rocks at their windows.
60479c2017ec4a044c2ed68f,4,The child who was left at home was scared.
60479c2017ec4a044c2ed68f,5,He tried to call his mother.
60479c2017ec4a044c2ed68f,6,But she did not answer.
60479c2017ec4a044c2ed68f,7,He waited until he thought it was safe.
60479c2017ec4a044c2ed68f,8,Then he came out of his hiding spot.
60479c2017ec4a044c2ed68f,9,His mother got home.
60479c2017ec4a044c2ed68f,10,He told her everything that happened.
60479c2017ec4a044c2ed68f,11,They then called the police.
60479c2017ec4a044c2ed68f,12,The police told them that they could do nothing about it.
60479c2017ec4a044c2ed68f,13,"They told them because they are black and this is an Irish neighborhood, they should just move out because the circumstances won't change."
60479c2017ec4a044c2ed68f,14,The mother was very smart from a very well known high school.
60479c2017ec4a044c2ed68f,15,She told the policeman that she will not move because she does not have enough money.
60479c2017ec4a044c2ed68f,16,The police insisted on them moving.
60479c2017ec4a044c2ed68f,17,She spent the whole time telling them that they don't have any money.
60479c2017ec4a044c2ed68f,18,The police then offered to take them home because they were tired of her speaking.
60479c2017ec4a044c2ed68f,19,She was the first person who actually spoke out on the situation.
60479c2017ec4a044c2ed68f,20,"As they were going out, there were people surrounding them telling them that they had to move out."
60479c2017ec4a044c2ed68f,21,The mother said that in order for them to move out all of them had to come up with enough money for a month's rent.
60479c2017ec4a044c2ed68f,22,They had to pay for that house in advance.
60479c2017ec4a044c2ed68f,23,She does not have the money to move anywhere else.
60479c2017ec4a044c2ed68f,24,"The story ends with the mother, saying that she will stay where she is."
60479c2017ec4a044c2ed68f,25,They have to accept that she is there.
60479c2017ec4a044c2ed68f,26,"Because even if she is black, she is no different to them."
612266e2ea3c172619abba50,1,The family had recently moved house.
612266e2ea3c172619abba50,2,The father wasn’t there
612266e2ea3c172619abba50,3,and the mother had gone to the store
612266e2ea3c172619abba50,4,when a window in the house was smashed by people in the neighbourhood.
612266e2ea3c172619abba50,5,"Even though the narrator was scared at what they would find outside,"
612266e2ea3c172619abba50,6,they left the house
612266e2ea3c172619abba50,7,and tracked down the mother at the store.
612266e2ea3c172619abba50,8,A policeman heard them tell what had happened
612266e2ea3c172619abba50,9,and said it’s a neighbourhood of Irish people
612266e2ea3c172619abba50,10,and they don’t want you there because you are black -
612266e2ea3c172619abba50,11,he didn’t actually say the word black.
612266e2ea3c172619abba50,12,This was in 1925
612266e2ea3c172619abba50,13,and the narrator was 10.
612266e2ea3c172619abba50,14,The mother asked which precinct he worked from
612266e2ea3c172619abba50,15,and they went there.
612266e2ea3c172619abba50,16,She spoke to someone there
612266e2ea3c172619abba50,17,"who told her she was best to pack up and leave,"
612266e2ea3c172619abba50,18,which she couldn’t afford to do.
612266e2ea3c172619abba50,19,She made them give a lift home with the police patrol
612266e2ea3c172619abba50,20,and when they arrived she spoke to the crowd.
612266e2ea3c172619abba50,21,She said you don’t want me here but I am paid for a month.
612266e2ea3c172619abba50,22,If you want us out then you need to give us the money to go.
612266e2ea3c172619abba50,23,Of course the neighbours didn’t.
612266e2ea3c172619abba50,24,The mother was educated
612266e2ea3c172619abba50,25,and had been to Lackawanna high school.
612266e2ea3c172619abba50,26,"Later then the dad was ill,"
612266e2ea3c172619abba50,27,the neighbours rallied round.
60ad5baa456e511fb21ba8fb,1,This is a story of a family
60ad5baa456e511fb21ba8fb,2,that moved to a new neighbourhood
60ad5baa456e511fb21ba8fb,3,and a ten year old is telling us how they were welcomed
60ad5baa456e511fb21ba8fb,4,by a flock of people
60ad5baa456e511fb21ba8fb,5,who threw stones in their house
60ad5baa456e511fb21ba8fb,6,and broke windows.
60ad5baa456e511fb21ba8fb,7,The ten year old was home alone
60ad5baa456e511fb21ba8fb,8,with their young siblings
60ad5baa456e511fb21ba8fb,9,whilst the mom was out to do some late night shopping
60ad5baa456e511fb21ba8fb,10,in the Jewish shops
60ad5baa456e511fb21ba8fb,11,that opened until very late.
60ad5baa456e511fb21ba8fb,12,The ten year old was faced with a challenge
60ad5baa456e511fb21ba8fb,13,of calming their siblings down
60ad5baa456e511fb21ba8fb,14,and ask them to hide in a place
60ad5baa456e511fb21ba8fb,15,where they would not be hit by the stones.
60ad5baa456e511fb21ba8fb,16,The ten year old later ran out
60ad5baa456e511fb21ba8fb,17,"to look for the mom,"
60ad5baa456e511fb21ba8fb,18,being careful not to be hit by the stones.
60ad5baa456e511fb21ba8fb,19,They finally found the mom in the Jewish stores
60ad5baa456e511fb21ba8fb,20,and let her know what was happening.
60ad5baa456e511fb21ba8fb,21,"Whilst the ten year old was trying to tell their mom,"
60ad5baa456e511fb21ba8fb,22,they could not breathe
60ad5baa456e511fb21ba8fb,23,or even utter the words properly
60ad5baa456e511fb21ba8fb,24,because due to being frightened.
60ad5baa456e511fb21ba8fb,25,There were police patrollers around
60ad5baa456e511fb21ba8fb,26,who kind of understood what the ten year old was trying to say
60ad5baa456e511fb21ba8fb,27,and they warned the mom about the area.
60ad5baa456e511fb21ba8fb,28,"They advised her to move to another area,"
60ad5baa456e511fb21ba8fb,29,"as that area was not ""good for them"","
60ad5baa456e511fb21ba8fb,30,and according to them people like them(blacks) were not welcomed in the area.
60ad5baa456e511fb21ba8fb,31,The mother told the patrol
60ad5baa456e511fb21ba8fb,32,that there's no way that they can move
60ad5baa456e511fb21ba8fb,33,because they had just moved in
60ad5baa456e511fb21ba8fb,34,"and paid rent,"
60ad5baa456e511fb21ba8fb,35,and the people took their money.
60ad5baa456e511fb21ba8fb,36,The mom insisted that the police help them
60ad5baa456e511fb21ba8fb,37,and they told her that there's nothing they can do.
60ad5baa456e511fb21ba8fb,38,She went to the station with them
60ad5baa456e511fb21ba8fb,39,"and asked them to take them home,"
60ad5baa456e511fb21ba8fb,40,which they did.
60ad5baa456e511fb21ba8fb,41,Eventually the family felt accepted in the neighbourhood
60ad5baa456e511fb21ba8fb,42,"when their father fell ill,"
60ad5baa456e511fb21ba8fb,43,the neighbours came by to visit them
60ad5baa456e511fb21ba8fb,44,and sent well wishes.
60ad5baa456e511fb21ba8fb,45,This all happened within the Irish community
60ad5baa456e511fb21ba8fb,46,during around 1925.
5e4e95ec6a0f23000c442ed2,1,A black family move into a new neighbourhood.
5e4e95ec6a0f23000c442ed2,2,The mother and father go out.
5e4e95ec6a0f23000c442ed2,3,They leave the children in the house.
5e4e95ec6a0f23000c442ed2,4,Mom goes to get shopping in the Jewish area.
5e4e95ec6a0f23000c442ed2,5,The father is probably out drinking.
5e4e95ec6a0f23000c442ed2,6,The house gets stoned.
5e4e95ec6a0f23000c442ed2,7,The eldest child moves the younger ones into the stair area.
5e4e95ec6a0f23000c442ed2,8,They move away from the windows.
5e4e95ec6a0f23000c442ed2,9,They do this so they won't get hurt with stones or glass.
5e4e95ec6a0f23000c442ed2,10,He was very scared.
5e4e95ec6a0f23000c442ed2,11,But he left the house to go look for his mom.
5e4e95ec6a0f23000c442ed2,12,He eventually finds her.
5e4e95ec6a0f23000c442ed2,13,He tells her what has happened.
5e4e95ec6a0f23000c442ed2,14,A passing policeman hears.
5e4e95ec6a0f23000c442ed2,15,He says it's a bad area.
5e4e95ec6a0f23000c442ed2,16,He says they should move.
5e4e95ec6a0f23000c442ed2,17,Mom says she has paid rent.
5e4e95ec6a0f23000c442ed2,18,She says she can't afford to move.
5e4e95ec6a0f23000c442ed2,19,The policeman says he can't help.
5e4e95ec6a0f23000c442ed2,20,He says no one wants black people there.
5e4e95ec6a0f23000c442ed2,21,He says it's mainly an Irish area.
5e4e95ec6a0f23000c442ed2,22,The mom is an educated lady.
5e4e95ec6a0f23000c442ed2,23,She says she will go to his station office for help.
5e4e95ec6a0f23000c442ed2,24,She gets them to take her home.
5e4e95ec6a0f23000c442ed2,25,She tells the neighbours she is there for a month.
5e4e95ec6a0f23000c442ed2,26,She says she has no money left to move.
5e4e95ec6a0f23000c442ed2,27,She says they will have to get used to it.
5e4e95ec6a0f23000c442ed2,28,Then the father gets sick.
5e4e95ec6a0f23000c442ed2,29,The neighbours are nice to them.
5e4e95ec6a0f23000c442ed2,30,They help the family.
6116c9e9f3490c79002fda6e,1,"The day that she moved into Third and Wharton,"
6116c9e9f3490c79002fda6e,2,"when she was 10,"
6116c9e9f3490c79002fda6e,3,her father left to return the team of horses
6116c9e9f3490c79002fda6e,4,and her mother went to do shopping on Fourth.
6116c9e9f3490c79002fda6e,5,Some people began to throw stones through the windows of the house they had rented.
6116c9e9f3490c79002fda6e,6,She took the other children into the stairway
6116c9e9f3490c79002fda6e,7,and told them to stay there
6116c9e9f3490c79002fda6e,8,because they would be safe from flyin' glass.
6116c9e9f3490c79002fda6e,9,"She left the house,"
6116c9e9f3490c79002fda6e,10,"and prayed,"
6116c9e9f3490c79002fda6e,11,not knowing if they would throw things at them.
6116c9e9f3490c79002fda6e,12,She found her mother shopping
6116c9e9f3490c79002fda6e,13,and explained what had happened.
6116c9e9f3490c79002fda6e,14,A police officer came over and asked.
6116c9e9f3490c79002fda6e,15,He said that the neighbourhood was bad
6116c9e9f3490c79002fda6e,16,and they were likely Irish.
6116c9e9f3490c79002fda6e,17,He was also Irish.
6116c9e9f3490c79002fda6e,18,He said he couldn't do anything.
6116c9e9f3490c79002fda6e,19,Her mother asked what precinct he was from
6116c9e9f3490c79002fda6e,20,"and he told her,"
6116c9e9f3490c79002fda6e,21,although the narrator didn't remember.
6116c9e9f3490c79002fda6e,22,Likely on Fifth.
6116c9e9f3490c79002fda6e,23,The captain was told the story
6116c9e9f3490c79002fda6e,24,and also said he couldn't do anything
6116c9e9f3490c79002fda6e,25,"because the girl didn't see who threw the stones,"
6116c9e9f3490c79002fda6e,26,and it was likely a number of people.
6116c9e9f3490c79002fda6e,27,"Both the original police officer and captain suggested the family move out,"
6116c9e9f3490c79002fda6e,28,because black people were not welcome there.
6116c9e9f3490c79002fda6e,29,"But her mother refused,"
6116c9e9f3490c79002fda6e,30,"as they didn't have any more money,"

5e283f576dbb560114ac7714,13,They said that there was nothing that could be done as we had not seen anybody and didn't even know how many people there was.
5e283f576dbb560114ac7714,14,My mama ended up just asking for the police to take us home.

5e283f576dbb560114ac7714,16,When we got back all the local Irish community gathered round.
5e283f576dbb560114ac7714,17,Then my mama spoke telling everybody that she might be black but she is just the same as everybody else in the area.
5e283f576dbb560114ac7714,18,She and her family were not going to move out as they had no money left.
5e283f576dbb560114ac7714,19,Everybody started to treat us as normal after that.
5e283f576dbb560114ac7714,20,Even helping us out when my father was sick.
5e13b302a2c6969f3c5d2485,1,The child was at home
5e13b302a2c6969f3c5d2485,2,when a brick was thrown through the house of the window
5e13b302a2c6969f3c5d2485,3,scaring the other children in the house.
5e13b302a2c6969f3c5d2485,4,The parents were away from the house at the time
5e13b302a2c6969f3c5d2485,5,and so the youngster left the house to find them.
5e13b302a2c6969f3c5d2485,6,The mother was shopping at the time
5e13b302a2c6969f3c5d2485,7,and she asked for help from the police
5e13b302a2c6969f3c5d2485,8,"who were less than helpful,"
5e13b302a2c6969f3c5d2485,9,told her that as she was a Black family they were not welcome in what was an Irish area
5e13b302a2c6969f3c5d2485,10,and told her to move.
5e13b302a2c6969f3c5d2485,11,She explained that she had just moved in
5e13b302a2c6969f3c5d2485,12,and had done so using a real estate agent
5e13b302a2c6969f3c5d2485,13,who had been happy to take her money
5e13b302a2c6969f3c5d2485,14,and she now had no money with which to move.
5e13b302a2c6969f3c5d2485,15,She then insisted that they be taken home by the police patrol.
5e13b302a2c6969f3c5d2485,16,Upon arriving at the house they were greeted by the neighbours
5e13b302a2c6969f3c5d2485,17,who she assumed had thrown the brick.
5e13b302a2c6969f3c5d2485,18,She addressed them
5e13b302a2c6969f3c5d2485,19,and explained that she could not afford to repair the windows
5e13b302a2c6969f3c5d2485,20,and that winter was coming
5e13b302a2c6969f3c5d2485,21,and requested a stop to this.
5e13b302a2c6969f3c5d2485,22,She told them that she had paid for a month
5e13b302a2c6969f3c5d2485,23,and after that she wasn't sure of their plans
5e13b302a2c6969f3c5d2485,24,"unless they were going to pay to have her leave she was staying,"
5e13b302a2c6969f3c5d2485,25,so that was that!
5e13b302a2c6969f3c5d2485,26,Not long after the father became ill
5e13b302a2c6969f3c5d2485,27,and the neighbours were kind to them.
60a2be69eb4d3bcbff354d5d,1,We had just moved to Third and Warton.
60a2be69eb4d3bcbff354d5d,2,The neighborhood was Jewish.
60a2be69eb4d3bcbff354d5d,3,My mom had just went to the market so I stayed with the kids.
60a2be69eb4d3bcbff354d5d,4,I was ten years old at the time.
60a2be69eb4d3bcbff354d5d,5,Clang clang clang.
60a2be69eb4d3bcbff354d5d,6,The people in the community threw stones at our windows and they got broken so I searched high and low for my mother.
60a2be69eb4d3bcbff354d5d,7,When I had explained to her what happened she reported it to the police officer.
60a2be69eb4d3bcbff354d5d,8,The police officer said there's nothing much he can do.
60a2be69eb4d3bcbff354d5d,9,He suggested we move.
60a2be69eb4d3bcbff354d5d,10,But my mom told him that we had just moved from where we were staying and now we should move again because this community doesn't like the color of our skin.
60a2be69eb4d3bcbff354d5d,11,She told him that we are the same people just a different color of skin.
60a2be69eb4d3bcbff354d5d,12,She continued to tell him how she paid a month's rent so she's not moving.
60a2be69eb4d3bcbff354d5d,13,If these people want her to move they should give her money to do so because she doesn't have any.
60a2be69eb4d3bcbff354d5d,14,She also said that the agent should've not taken her money because she knows how this community will react to our family staying there.
60a2be69eb4d3bcbff354d5d,15,The police officer told my mom that the people of this community don't have money either and therefore can't give any to her so she can leave.
60a2be69eb4d3bcbff354d5d,16,My mom said she will stay the entire month because she paid for it.
60a2be69eb4d3bcbff354d5d,17,The community will have to accept them.
5fb402a66cba9801673f2b5c,1,We were at third and wharton
5fb402a66cba9801673f2b5c,2,and father had gone out
5fb402a66cba9801673f2b5c,3,and mother had gone to the market to buy some food.
5fb402a66cba9801673f2b5c,4,I was in the house with the children
5fb402a66cba9801673f2b5c,5,and people started throwing rocks through the window
5fb402a66cba9801673f2b5c,6,and there was a big crash.
5fb402a66cba9801673f2b5c,7,I realised what was happening
5fb402a66cba9801673f2b5c,8,and put the children under the stairs to shelter there.
5fb402a66cba9801673f2b5c,9,Mother had gone to fourth street to buy food at the market.
5fb402a66cba9801673f2b5c,10,It was a jewish market
5fb402a66cba9801673f2b5c,11,and they were open all hours to make as much money as they could.
5fb402a66cba9801673f2b5c,12,"I decided to go find her at the market,"
5fb402a66cba9801673f2b5c,13,I didn't know what was going to happen when I got outside
5fb402a66cba9801673f2b5c,14,so I said a prayer
5fb402a66cba9801673f2b5c,15,and then ran all the way there.
5fb402a66cba9801673f2b5c,16,When I got there I found her
5fb402a66cba9801673f2b5c,17,and I was trying to tell her what happened
5fb402a66cba9801673f2b5c,18,but I was so upset my voice was such that she couldn't understand.
5fb402a66cba9801673f2b5c,19,While I was there a policeman walked by
5fb402a66cba9801673f2b5c,20,and stopped to see what was happening
5fb402a66cba9801673f2b5c,21,and we told him.
5fb402a66cba9801673f2b5c,22,Mother said what are you going to do about it
5fb402a66cba9801673f2b5c,23,and he said the only thing to do is to move.
5fb402a66cba9801673f2b5c,24,She said I'm not going to move because I only just moved there.
5fb402a66cba9801673f2b5c,25,He said it's an Irish neighbourhood
5fb402a66cba9801673f2b5c,26,and they dont want any black people there.
5fb402a66cba9801673f2b5c,27,"Well he didn't say black,"
5fb402a66cba9801673f2b5c,28,he just said they don't want anybody there.
5fb402a66cba9801673f2b5c,29,She asked him what precinct he is from to find someone else who would help us
5fb402a66cba9801673f2b5c,30,and he told us but I can't remember where it was.
5fb402a66cba9801673f2b5c,31,We went there and spoke to the captain
5fb402a66cba9801673f2b5c,32,and said what are you going to do about it
5fb402a66cba9801673f2b5c,33,and he said nothing
5fb402a66cba9801673f2b5c,34,"and said you have to move, same as the other policeman."
5fb402a66cba9801673f2b5c,35,Mother said well I know one thing you can do
5fb402a66cba9801673f2b5c,36,and that is to take us home.
5fb402a66cba9801673f2b5c,37,The policeman took us back to the house from about 5th street
5fb402a66cba9801673f2b5c,38,and when we got there he got out and helped mother down from the door.
5fb402a66cba9801673f2b5c,39,All the people were there standing outside
5fb402a66cba9801673f2b5c,40,and she said to them you all know whats happened
5fb402a66cba9801673f2b5c,41,and I don't know who did it
5fb402a66cba9801673f2b5c,42,but I do know I'm not going to move.
5fb402a66cba9801673f2b5c,43,I just moved in here and spent all my money to rent this house for a month
5fb402a66cba9801673f2b5c,44,and don't have any more money.
5fb402a66cba9801673f2b5c,45,You might as well make up your minds that I will be here for this month
5fb402a66cba9801673f2b5c,46,and if you want me to move then you all can put your money together for me.
5fb402a66cba9801673f2b5c,47,It is winter and cold
5fb402a66cba9801673f2b5c,48,and I don't have any money to be buying windows.
5fb402a66cba9801673f2b5c,49,I don't even know if I will have enough money to stay here for another month.
5fb402a66cba9801673f2b5c,50,After that the neighbours we very friendly
5fb402a66cba9801673f2b5c,51,and my dad got sick while we were living there
5fb402a66cba9801673f2b5c,52,and everyone wanted to help us
5fb402a66cba9801673f2b5c,53,and was kind.
5fb402a66cba9801673f2b5c,54,That was my introduction to the neighbourhood
5fb402a66cba9801673f2b5c,55,and it was terrifying.
5e9ffcf4db51941ad78e04f3,1,We moved to Forth and Wharton.
5e9ffcf4db51941ad78e04f3,2,My father drank.
5e9ffcf4db51941ad78e04f3,3,He took the horses.
5e9ffcf4db51941ad78e04f3,4,My mother went to the shops and left me with the kids.
5e9ffcf4db51941ad78e04f3,5,Stones broke to windows and I took the kids somewhere safe and then went to get my mother.
5e9ffcf4db51941ad78e04f3,6,I was 10 years old and did not know if I would be hit.
5e9ffcf4db51941ad78e04f3,7,The shops were open late and I reached my mother.
5e9ffcf4db51941ad78e04f3,8,I could hardly tell her what happens my voice failed me.
5e9ffcf4db51941ad78e04f3,9,A policeman came and said that he could do nothing it was a bad neighbourhood Irish and they did not like black people.
5e9ffcf4db51941ad78e04f3,10,We should move out.
5e9ffcf4db51941ad78e04f3,11,My mother who was educated and had finished High School said she had only just moved in and could not afford to move out.
5e9ffcf4db51941ad78e04f3,12,She wanted to know where the precinct was.
5e9ffcf4db51941ad78e04f3,13,The Captain she spoke to said that he could do nothing.
5e9ffcf4db51941ad78e04f3,14,My mother said that one thing they could do is give us a lift home in a police wagon.
5e9ffcf4db51941ad78e04f3,15,"We went back in a police wagon that went clank, clank, clank pulled by horses."
5e9ffcf4db51941ad78e04f3,16,When we got home my mother addressed the crowd saying that she had only just moved in and had paid the rent so had nothing left.
5e9ffcf4db51941ad78e04f3,17,If they want her to move out they should pay her rent.
5e9ffcf4db51941ad78e04f3,18,They did not do that.
5e9ffcf4db51941ad78e04f3,19,Later my dad fell ill and the neighbours were really nice.
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,1,We moved in to Third and Warton
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,2,and not long after my dad got drunk
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,3,and went out back to try and take the horses out.
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,4,"My mother had gone to the store to get some groceries on Fourth,"
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,5,"not long after my mom, we call mother mom had gone to the store"
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,6,and my father had gone out
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,7,"there was stones being thrown at our house,"
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,8,"I quickly moved my siblings to hide under the stairwell,"
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,9,"I told them ""Do not move because you will be safe here and no stone will hit you""."
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,10,I was very frightened
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,11,"but prepared myself to go look for my mother,"
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,12,but was not sure what would happen immediately I stepped through the door
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,13,"and ran to Fourth as that's where the carts where being pushed,"
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,14,I looked for my mom and found her
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,15,"and while trying to explain what had happened, a police officer happened to pass by,"
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,16,"so after I composed myself a bit,"
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,17,I explained to him what had happened
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,18,"and all he could say to my mother and I was ""You have to move"""
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,19,"the town is Irish,"
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,20,my mom being angry and asked how he could say something like that
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,21,and explained we had only moved here recently
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,22,and she doesn't have money to move again.
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,23,"The officer said he could not do anything as it sort of a norm here as we are black,"
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,24,"he didn't say black because they didn't say that then but that's basically what he meant,"
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,25,the officer was Irish as well.
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,26,My mom angrily asked for his station and to speak to the captain.
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,27,"We went over to the police station which wasn't too far from where we were,"
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,28,it was on Fifth.
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,29,"We entered and demanded to speak to the captain,"
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,30,we explained the situation and he basically said the same thing as the police officer.
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,31,"I was surprised and impressed by my mom,"
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,32,she stood her ground as she was more educated having gone to school in nineteen twenty-five.
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,33,"She explained to the captain that we have only moved here and have no money to go someplace else,"
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,34,"and he said there was not much he could do as there was no one to blame,"
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,35,"he also asked me if it was possible that there have been multiple people, which would make it harder to but the blame on someone."
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,36,My mother suggested arresting the real estate agents as they sold the property to her despite knowing the situation in the town.
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,37,My mother then said the least they could do was to drop off home
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,38,and since the captain was tired of us being there because the conversation was long and loud he agreed.
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,39,We went into the station patrol vehicle that had a bell attached to it
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,40,"and made a  ""Clang clang clang"" sound as we moved,"
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,41,"during the journey, due to the bell a number of people came out of their homes to watch what was going on."
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,42,"When we reached our house, my mom turned to address the people watching,"
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,43,she said we had just moved here and paid money for rent for the month
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,44,and that we were going to stay for the month
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,45,"and that after that she didn't know,"
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,46,she also told them apart from the colour of their skin they were all the same people
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,47,and that they should get used to us being here.
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,48,"She also suggested that if they all really wanted us to leave they should donate money for the family to move somewhere else,"
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,49,which they didn't because they probably didn't have any money either.
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,50,"After that day, everyone seemed to be nicer"
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,51,and even when my dad was sick they helped and offered whatever they had just like anyone else would.
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,52,It was all good
60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df,53,but my first initially welcome to that area was terrible!
5a86e1a4eea3d300016e7981,1,The family had moved into a new neighbourhood
5a86e1a4eea3d300016e7981,2,and had paid the rent a month up front.
5a86e1a4eea3d300016e7981,3,The father had gone to tend to the horses
5a86e1a4eea3d300016e7981,4,and then some people came
5a86e1a4eea3d300016e7981,5,and threw stones at the house.
5a86e1a4eea3d300016e7981,6,The family were all afraid
5a86e1a4eea3d300016e7981,7,and so they fled.
5a86e1a4eea3d300016e7981,8,They asked for help in a Jewish neighbourhood
5a86e1a4eea3d300016e7981,9,and then were directed to a police station.
5a86e1a4eea3d300016e7981,10,The police were unhelpful initially
5a86e1a4eea3d300016e7981,11,and told the family the solution was to move.
5a86e1a4eea3d300016e7981,12,The mother explained that due to financial reasons this was impossible.
5a86e1a4eea3d300016e7981,13,She insisted that the police take them home
5a86e1a4eea3d300016e7981,14,and so they rode in the back of the police wagon with the bell clanging.
5a86e1a4eea3d300016e7981,15,They arrived home
5a86e1a4eea3d300016e7981,16,and climbed down the back steps of the wagon
5a86e1a4eea3d300016e7981,17,to be met by several neighbours watching.
5a86e1a4eea3d300016e7981,18,"The mother gave an impassioned speech about how, despite their colour they were just the same as everyone else."
5a86e1a4eea3d300016e7981,19,This changed people's opinions
5a86e1a4eea3d300016e7981,20,and they then helped and supported the family
5a86e1a4eea3d300016e7981,21,even when the Father became ill.
5fcfc5d2efeec61409aa6cf7,1,It happened in 1925.
5fcfc5d2efeec61409aa6cf7,2,The narrator was 10.
5fcfc5d2efeec61409aa6cf7,3,"The father was day drinking and out of the house,"
5fcfc5d2efeec61409aa6cf7,4,after he'd moved their furniture into the house.
5fcfc5d2efeec61409aa6cf7,5,The mother was out shopping.
5fcfc5d2efeec61409aa6cf7,6,A rock crashed through the windows of the house.
5fcfc5d2efeec61409aa6cf7,7,The children hid in the hallway to avoid the glass.
5fcfc5d2efeec61409aa6cf7,8,"The oldest of the children ran out of the house to Fourth Street,"
5fcfc5d2efeec61409aa6cf7,9,where the mother was.
5fcfc5d2efeec61409aa6cf7,10,"There, they found a policeman."
5fcfc5d2efeec61409aa6cf7,11,"He told them that this was a bad neighbourhood,"
5fcfc5d2efeec61409aa6cf7,12,and that they should move.
5fcfc5d2efeec61409aa6cf7,13,He was Irish.
5fcfc5d2efeec61409aa6cf7,14,"The mother told him that they didn't have any money to move,"
5fcfc5d2efeec61409aa6cf7,15,and they had just moved into the house.
5fcfc5d2efeec61409aa6cf7,16,He said there was nothing he could do.
5fcfc5d2efeec61409aa6cf7,17,"She was a smart black woman,"
5fcfc5d2efeec61409aa6cf7,18,the only one in her family to have finished high school.
5fcfc5d2efeec61409aa6cf7,19,"She asked where the nearest police station was,"
5fcfc5d2efeec61409aa6cf7,20,so that she could ask someone who would be able to do something.
5fcfc5d2efeec61409aa6cf7,21,"At the station, she got the same answer:"
5fcfc5d2efeec61409aa6cf7,22,"that there was nothing to be done,"
5fcfc5d2efeec61409aa6cf7,23,except move.
5fcfc5d2efeec61409aa6cf7,24,She then told them there was one thing they could do:
5fcfc5d2efeec61409aa6cf7,25,to drive them home in the patrol car.
5fcfc5d2efeec61409aa6cf7,26,They did.
5fcfc5d2efeec61409aa6cf7,27,The car made such a clanging noise
5fcfc5d2efeec61409aa6cf7,28,that all of their neighbours came out of their houses to see what was happening.
5fcfc5d2efeec61409aa6cf7,29,"When she got out of the police car,"
5fcfc5d2efeec61409aa6cf7,30,"the mother announced to the neighbours that she knows she looks different due to having different skin colour,"
5fcfc5d2efeec61409aa6cf7,31,but that they could only afford to stay in the house a month.
5fcfc5d2efeec61409aa6cf7,32,"Perhaps they would get enough money to afford to stay another month,"
5fcfc5d2efeec61409aa6cf7,33,"but in the meantime, the neighbours only had to put up with them for a month."
5fcfc5d2efeec61409aa6cf7,34,"She didn't know who threw the rock, she told them,"
5fcfc5d2efeec61409aa6cf7,35,"but it was winter and it was cold,"
5fcfc5d2efeec61409aa6cf7,36,and she couldn't afford new windows.
5fcfc5d2efeec61409aa6cf7,37,"She said that she had no money to move right away,"
5fcfc5d2efeec61409aa6cf7,38,"but if they wanted, the neighbours could give her the money to move."
5fcfc5d2efeec61409aa6cf7,39,"They didn't do that,"
5fcfc5d2efeec61409aa6cf7,40,"but afterwards, when the father got sick, they were kind and courteous to the family."
5f6c238ed9915e19408f161b,1,A black family moved to an all white neighbourhood
5f6c238ed9915e19408f161b,2,and someone through a stone through their window in protest.
5f6c238ed9915e19408f161b,3,The mother went to the police station to complain
5f6c238ed9915e19408f161b,4,but they didn't want to do anything
5f6c238ed9915e19408f161b,5,since it was a white irish neighbourhood.
5f6c238ed9915e19408f161b,6,"The mother was upset after paying a month's rent,"
5f6c238ed9915e19408f161b,7,knowing she and her family would have to stay
5f6c238ed9915e19408f161b,8,so she told the police to escort her home
5f6c238ed9915e19408f161b,9,so the neighbours would all come out to see her with the police
5f6c238ed9915e19408f161b,10,(there was a loud bell attached to the police wagon
5f6c238ed9915e19408f161b,11,so all neighbours heard it
5f6c238ed9915e19408f161b,12,and came outside to watch)
5f6c238ed9915e19408f161b,13,When the neighbors were outside
5f6c238ed9915e19408f161b,14,the Mom announced that she had no money to move
5f6c238ed9915e19408f161b,15,so the neighbours could give her money to move
5f6c238ed9915e19408f161b,16,or put up with them.
5f6c238ed9915e19408f161b,17,In the end the neighbours came around
5f6c238ed9915e19408f161b,18,"even being there for the family when the Dad got sick,"
5f6c238ed9915e19408f161b,19,but it was a scary beginning to moving into the white neighbourhood
5f6c238ed9915e19408f161b,20,for this black family.
5c4f30828f1259000172240d,1,The story is about a ten year old child in a Black family in 1925.
5c4f30828f1259000172240d,2,"One day they come home,"
5c4f30828f1259000172240d,3,and after their parents go out
5c4f30828f1259000172240d,4,"(their father to fetch some horses,"
5c4f30828f1259000172240d,5,"their mother to shop at the local Jewish market which stays open late),"
5c4f30828f1259000172240d,6,"someone throws a stone through the window of their home,"
5c4f30828f1259000172240d,7,smashing the glass
5c4f30828f1259000172240d,8,and scaring the child and their siblings.
5c4f30828f1259000172240d,9,"They go to find their mother,"
5c4f30828f1259000172240d,10,and encounter a policeman.
5c4f30828f1259000172240d,11,The child and their mother complain to the policeman about what happens;
5c4f30828f1259000172240d,12,"the policeman blames the Irish neighbourhood,"
5c4f30828f1259000172240d,13,"being Irish himself,"
5c4f30828f1259000172240d,14,and attributes it to them not wanting Black neighbours.
5c4f30828f1259000172240d,15,"He says he can't do anything about it,"
5c4f30828f1259000172240d,16,"so the mother insists on attending his precinct,"
5c4f30828f1259000172240d,17,and speaking to his captain.
5c4f30828f1259000172240d,18,"The captain also claims not to be able to help,"
5c4f30828f1259000172240d,19,so the mother asks him to drive them home in the patrol vehicle.
5c4f30828f1259000172240d,20,"They're dropped off near their home,"
5c4f30828f1259000172240d,21,"the noise of the vehicle draws out their neighbours,"
5c4f30828f1259000172240d,22,"and she addresses them all,"
5c4f30828f1259000172240d,23,"telling them that if they don't want her and her family there,"
5c4f30828f1259000172240d,24,"they should pay for them to move house,"
5c4f30828f1259000172240d,25,"as she can't afford it,"
5c4f30828f1259000172240d,26,and will be there for at least a month.
5c4f30828f1259000172240d,27,"Thereafter, the neighbours are kind to them,"
5c4f30828f1259000172240d,28,"especially when the child's father is sick,"
5c4f30828f1259000172240d,29,but the child holds onto the memory of that frightening welcome to the neighbourhood.
5c6088630112a60001a2b1e7,1,A man is recalling a time
5c6088630112a60001a2b1e7,2,"when, as a ten year old, having just moved to a new rental unit in an Irish neighborhood."
5c6088630112a60001a2b1e7,3,He's alone
5c6088630112a60001a2b1e7,4,and his mom is at the market
5c6088630112a60001a2b1e7,5,and stones start to fly through the windows.
5c6088630112a60001a2b1e7,6,He hides his siblings under the stairs
5c6088630112a60001a2b1e7,7,and runs out to the market to find his mother.
5c6088630112a60001a2b1e7,8,She approaches a police officer
5c6088630112a60001a2b1e7,9,"who tells her that black people aren't welcome in Irish neighborhoods,"
5c6088630112a60001a2b1e7,10,and that there's nothing he can do.
5c6088630112a60001a2b1e7,11,She tells him that she will go to the precinct
5c6088630112a60001a2b1e7,12,and find someone who can help.
5c6088630112a60001a2b1e7,13,The man recalls her mother as being unusual among black people of the time
5c6088630112a60001a2b1e7,14,in that she was not afraid to confront authority or people in uniforms.
5c6088630112a60001a2b1e7,15,When she talks to the police chief at the precinct
5c6088630112a60001a2b1e7,16,he repeats the same advice- to move
5c6088630112a60001a2b1e7,17,and that he can't help her as she hasn't identified the suspect.
5c6088630112a60001a2b1e7,18,She tells him all her money has gone to rent
5c6088630112a60001a2b1e7,19,and she can't afford to move.
5c6088630112a60001a2b1e7,20,"She asks for a ride home,"
5c6088630112a60001a2b1e7,21,and the officer agrees.
5c6088630112a60001a2b1e7,22,"She confronts her neighbors,"
5c6088630112a60001a2b1e7,23,tells them she's paid for a month
5c6088630112a60001a2b1e7,24,"and can't afford to move anywhere else,"
5c6088630112a60001a2b1e7,25,"and that she will not be moving,"
5c6088630112a60001a2b1e7,26,and can't afford new windows.
5c6088630112a60001a2b1e7,27,She reminds the neighborhood that she's fundamentally the same as them despite her difference in color-
5c6088630112a60001a2b1e7,28,that she's trying to look after her family
5c6088630112a60001a2b1e7,29,and make ends meet.
5f933255e25f2b0e6f794a54,1,A family moved into an area
5f933255e25f2b0e6f794a54,2,that I presume to be white.
5f933255e25f2b0e6f794a54,3,They were a family of colour.
5f933255e25f2b0e6f794a54,4,There were horses involved at the start of the story.
5f933255e25f2b0e6f794a54,5,"Their house, which was rented,"
5f933255e25f2b0e6f794a54,6,was damaged by stones
5f933255e25f2b0e6f794a54,7,which they didn't have the money to fix.
5f933255e25f2b0e6f794a54,8,"They had enough money for one month,"
5f933255e25f2b0e6f794a54,9,paid in advance.
5f933255e25f2b0e6f794a54,10,"After being brought home by police,"
5f933255e25f2b0e6f794a54,11,the family confronted the neighbours
5f933255e25f2b0e6f794a54,12,who were watching their return
5f933255e25f2b0e6f794a54,13,"and stated that if they were not wanted in the neighbourhood,"
5f933255e25f2b0e6f794a54,14,they could all scrape together some cash for them to move.
5f933255e25f2b0e6f794a54,15,"This didn't happen,"
5f933255e25f2b0e6f794a54,16,and while they were living in the property
5f933255e25f2b0e6f794a54,17,the father became sick
5f933255e25f2b0e6f794a54,18,and all the neighbours were nice to them.
60a2df32808ac76c056b37b9,1,A black family moved into an Irish neighborhood.
60a2df32808ac76c056b37b9,2,"While they were moving their stuff in the house,"
60a2df32808ac76c056b37b9,3,The mother decided to go buy food at a store
60a2df32808ac76c056b37b9,4,while the children stayed with the dad.
60a2df32808ac76c056b37b9,5,While the dad was busy with the horses and packages
60a2df32808ac76c056b37b9,6,the children had a crash.
60a2df32808ac76c056b37b9,7,Someone was throwing stones at their house.
60a2df32808ac76c056b37b9,8,The older child quickly ran with the younger children
60a2df32808ac76c056b37b9,9,and hid them
60a2df32808ac76c056b37b9,10,and told them to stay there
60a2df32808ac76c056b37b9,11,as it was safe from glasses
60a2df32808ac76c056b37b9,12,and them being hurt.
60a2df32808ac76c056b37b9,13,The older boy was very frightened
60a2df32808ac76c056b37b9,14,but he bravely went out to go look for his mother.
60a2df32808ac76c056b37b9,15,He knew his mom went to a local shop at long street
60a2df32808ac76c056b37b9,16,that opens for long hours to get maximum profit.
60a2df32808ac76c056b37b9,17,When he got there
60a2df32808ac76c056b37b9,18,he tried explaining to his mom what happened
60a2df32808ac76c056b37b9,19,when a policeman noticed the commotion.
60a2df32808ac76c056b37b9,20,He went to them
60a2df32808ac76c056b37b9,21,and asked what the matter was.
60a2df32808ac76c056b37b9,22,The child explained everything
60a2df32808ac76c056b37b9,23,and the policeman told him there's nothing they could do
60a2df32808ac76c056b37b9,24,as it is an Irish neighborhood.
60a2df32808ac76c056b37b9,25,He also told her that they would not even know who to put the blame on
60a2df32808ac76c056b37b9,26,as they didn't know who threw the stone.
60a2df32808ac76c056b37b9,27,He told him the best thing he thinks they should do is move out.
60a2df32808ac76c056b37b9,28,The mother was upset
60a2df32808ac76c056b37b9,29,and told the man he is not going to do that
60a2df32808ac76c056b37b9,30,because she used the last money she had on paying rent.
60a2df32808ac76c056b37b9,31,The mother asked the policeman to be taken home
60a2df32808ac76c056b37b9,32,and the man escorted them back home.
60a2df32808ac76c056b37b9,33,When they got home
60a2df32808ac76c056b37b9,34,they found a crowd facing her house.
60a2df32808ac76c056b37b9,35,When they were heading to their new place
60a2df32808ac76c056b37b9,36,the mom faced the crowd
60a2df32808ac76c056b37b9,37,and told them she has nowhere else to go
60a2df32808ac76c056b37b9,38,and has no money to move out
60a2df32808ac76c056b37b9,39,but if they had money they can contribute to move them out.
60a2df32808ac76c056b37b9,40,She told them she is just as the same as them
60a2df32808ac76c056b37b9,41,besides the color of her skin
60a2df32808ac76c056b37b9,42,and it should not matter.
60a2df32808ac76c056b37b9,43,During their time there
60a2df32808ac76c056b37b9,44,the father got sick
60a2df32808ac76c056b37b9,45,and the neighborhood was extremely nice
60a2df32808ac76c056b37b9,46,but the child still remembers the first day as very frightening.
5ea166af93435d0008a8a341,1,We moved to Lackton on fourth street.
5ea166af93435d0008a8a341,2,"Well, my father was a drunk and went out."
5ea166af93435d0008a8a341,3,Then my mum went out too and I was looking after the kids.
5ea166af93435d0008a8a341,4,Then there was a mighty crash and a brick came through the window.
5ea166af93435d0008a8a341,5,"I didn't know where my mom was, I was only 10, but I guess she had gone shopping in the Fifth."
5ea166af93435d0008a8a341,6,"It's a Jewish quarter and they stay open all hours, you know, to make money."
5ea166af93435d0008a8a341,7,I found my mom and told her what had happened.
5ea166af93435d0008a8a341,8,"She found a policeman, who was Irish, and said that the Irish were dangerous and he couldn't do anything."
5ea166af93435d0008a8a341,9,My mom asked him to take her to the police station where they still had wagons pulled by horses.
5ea166af93435d0008a8a341,10,She found the commissioner who asked her if I'd seen who dunnit.
5ea166af93435d0008a8a341,11,I hadn't and he said there was nothing he could do.
5ea166af93435d0008a8a341,12,They don't like black people round here.
5ea166af93435d0008a8a341,13,My mom was strong and didn't accept that.
5ea166af93435d0008a8a341,14,She told the commissioner to take her home in the police wagon.
5ea166af93435d0008a8a341,15,"When they got back to fourth street she stood on the steps of the wagon and said 'Look here I've paid my rent for a month, its all we have and we are not moving."
5ea166af93435d0008a8a341,16,If you want us to move then give us a months rent'.
5ea166af93435d0008a8a341,17,They didn't have any money either.
5ea166af93435d0008a8a341,18,Then dad came back and became sick.
5ea166af93435d0008a8a341,19,They were nice to him and cared for him.
62d7e6e7eb53424768b99d3b,1,"Girl aged 10 moved to 3rd & Warton with her mother, father & kids presumably the siblings."
62d7e6e7eb53424768b99d3b,2,Father drank.
62d7e6e7eb53424768b99d3b,3,As soon as they had moved in the mother went to a shop.
62d7e6e7eb53424768b99d3b,4,The father went out.
62d7e6e7eb53424768b99d3b,5,A crash sounded & a big stone came through the window.
62d7e6e7eb53424768b99d3b,6,I moved the kids and told them to stay there.
62d7e6e7eb53424768b99d3b,7,I was scared to death but ran out thinking something might hit me.
62d7e6e7eb53424768b99d3b,8,I ran to the shop.
62d7e6e7eb53424768b99d3b,9,It was owned by Jews & stayed open late.
62d7e6e7eb53424768b99d3b,10,I found my mother was telling her what happened & a policeman was there.
62d7e6e7eb53424768b99d3b,11,I tried to tell my story.
62d7e6e7eb53424768b99d3b,12,He told my mother it was a bad Irish neighbourhood.
62d7e6e7eb53424768b99d3b,13,Policeman was Irish too.
62d7e6e7eb53424768b99d3b,14,My mother asked for a lift home in the police wagon.
62d7e6e7eb53424768b99d3b,15,It was 1925 she was black but not cowed by authority.
62d7e6e7eb53424768b99d3b,16,As she went to school we got a lift in the police wagon with the horses and the bell clanging.
62d7e6e7eb53424768b99d3b,17,We made a lot of noise.
62d7e6e7eb53424768b99d3b,18,The policeman told us to move.
62d7e6e7eb53424768b99d3b,19,My mother said she had no money.
5f107aa051372032695c8e2f,1,In 1925 a black family moved into an irish neighborhood.

5f107aa051372032695c8e2f,5,He found her in the market and told her what was happening.
5f107aa051372032695c8e2f,6,"When she tried to explain things to the police, the police said that they couldn't do anything about it as there were no witnesses who could identify the culprits."
5f107aa051372032695c8e2f,7,The police also added that she shouldn't have moved to an irish neighborhood in the first place.
5f107aa051372032695c8e2f,8,"After hearing this she said they had no choice,"
5f107aa051372032695c8e2f,9,and that they were there until the end of the month at least.

605ba57d2842d8291b4afd24,2,"On the day they moved,"
605ba57d2842d8291b4afd24,3,"after the father had put the furniture inside the house,"
605ba57d2842d8291b4afd24,4,"left to drink,"
605ba57d2842d8291b4afd24,5,but that was after the mother had already left to go and do shopping.
605ba57d2842d8291b4afd24,6,"When the parents were gone,"
605ba57d2842d8291b4afd24,7,someone or some people in the neighborhood threw stones to their house.

605ba57d2842d8291b4afd24,10,She then left to the store to tell her mother what had happened.

605ba57d2842d8291b4afd24,15,"the neighborhood is Irish,"
605ba57d2842d8291b4afd24,16,and they don't want people of color.
605ba57d2842d8291b4afd24,17,The mother said that they would not move just because they are black.
605ba57d2842d8291b4afd24,18,The policemen then took them home
605ba57d2842d8291b4afd24,19,and all the neighbors came out when they saw the police horses and heard the bell.
605ba57d2842d8291b4afd24,20,The mother addressed them
605ba57d2842d8291b4afd24,21,"and told that if they wanted her gone, they would have to give her money, otherwise she is not going anywhere."
605ba57d2842d8291b4afd24,22,They continued to live there
605ba57d2842d8291b4afd24,23,and the Neighbours started to help even when the dad got sick.

63d66d856ec54ad9b9cfa338,5,As soon as she had left
63d66d856ec54ad9b9cfa338,6,someone threw a stone through the window
63d66d856ec54ad9b9cfa338,7,and I put the other children by the stairs
63d66d856ec54ad9b9cfa338,8,and I said that they should stay there
63d66d856ec54ad9b9cfa338,9,because they would be safe there.
63d66d856ec54ad9b9cfa338,10,I was frightened
63d66d856ec54ad9b9cfa338,11,but I went out.
63d66d856ec54ad9b9cfa338,12,My mother came back
63d66d856ec54ad9b9cfa338,13,and she saw what had happened
63d66d856ec54ad9b9cfa338,14,and the police came
63d66d856ec54ad9b9cfa338,15,and the police said that this was a bad neighbourhood
63d66d856ec54ad9b9cfa338,16,and we should move.
63d66d856ec54ad9b9cfa338,17,He said it was an Irish neighbourhood
63d66d856ec54ad9b9cfa338,18,and that the Irish did not want us there.
63d66d856ec54ad9b9cfa338,19,And my mother went to the police station with them in a police patrol with a horse.
63d66d856ec54ad9b9cfa338,20,And she said to the officer that she could not move
63d66d856ec54ad9b9cfa338,21,because she had no money
63d66d856ec54ad9b9cfa338,22,because she had to pay the rent in advance.
63d66d856ec54ad9b9cfa338,23,And she said that if the neighbours did not want us there
63d66d856ec54ad9b9cfa338,24,then they should not have taken the rent in advance.
63d66d856ec54ad9b9cfa338,25,"And she said to the police what are you going to do,"
63d66d856ec54ad9b9cfa338,26,but the police said there was nothing they could do.
63d66d856ec54ad9b9cfa338,27,"She said there was something they could do,"
63d66d856ec54ad9b9cfa338,28,they could take her home in the police patrol
63d66d856ec54ad9b9cfa338,29,which they did.
63d66d856ec54ad9b9cfa338,30,All the neighbours came out
63d66d856ec54ad9b9cfa338,31,because they heard the noise of the patrol
63d66d856ec54ad9b9cfa338,32,and my mother said that it was winter
63d66d856ec54ad9b9cfa338,33,and she did not have the money to pay for windows.
63d66d856ec54ad9b9cfa338,34,She said that all she wanted to do was to look after her family
63d66d856ec54ad9b9cfa338,35,and that she had paid in advance
63d66d856ec54ad9b9cfa338,36,and she did not have any money.
63d66d856ec54ad9b9cfa338,37,After that the neighbours were nice
63d66d856ec54ad9b9cfa338,38,and they were nice when my father was ill
63d66d856ec54ad9b9cfa338,39,but at the start they had not been nice.

5d0bedd29d49670018383c20,33,She also said that they do not have the money to move.

5dcc6f91e5e18690a20e74d1,14,where there is a Jewish shop that is open late.
5dcc6f91e5e18690a20e74d1,15,(The narrator comments that they want to make as much money as they can so open all hours)

5dcc6f91e5e18690a20e74d1,19,as the narrator is talking loudly
5dcc6f91e5e18690a20e74d1,20,and asks what has happened.

5dcc6f91e5e18690a20e74d1,22,and is asked what he is going to do.

5dcc6f91e5e18690a20e74d1,24,"and he can do nothing about it,"
5dcc6f91e5e18690a20e74d1,25,it is said he is Irish himself.
5dcc6f91e5e18690a20e74d1,26,Mom asks his precinct
5dcc6f91e5e18690a20e74d1,27,and goes there to complain

5dcc6f91e5e18690a20e74d1,29,to which the Captain explains that if the narrator did not see who threw the stones they cannot know who is to blame.

5dcc6f91e5e18690a20e74d1,37,"and mom tells everyone that although they are a different skin colour, she and her family are the same in every other way"
5dcc6f91e5e18690a20e74d1,38,and she only wants to take care of her family just like they do.

5dcc6f91e5e18690a20e74d1,40,and If they don't want the family there they can give her the money
5dcc6f91e5e18690a20e74d1,41,"and she will happily move,"
5dcc6f91e5e18690a20e74d1,42,of course no one offers
5dcc6f91e5e18690a20e74d1,43,and the narrator comments that no one would have that sort of money in any case.
5dcc6f91e5e18690a20e74d1,44,The narrator tells us that the neighbours were always kind and considerate to them
5dcc6f91e5e18690a20e74d1,45,and when her father got sick they were helpful and kind.
60c283d8d82adfb1f4930352,1,There is a family
60c283d8d82adfb1f4930352,2,who moved out .
60df7ffed00034efd9a002c1,1,They moved to Third and Wharton.
60df7ffed00034efd9a002c1,2,The father was to bring back the horses.
60df7ffed00034efd9a002c1,3,But he didn't come back.
60df7ffed00034efd9a002c1,4,The narrator was to mind the children.
60df7ffed00034efd9a002c1,5,While the mother went shopping.
60df7ffed00034efd9a002c1,6,When she was gone someone threw stones at the house.
60df7ffed00034efd9a002c1,7,And smashed the windows.
60df7ffed00034efd9a002c1,8,The narrator went to find their mother.
60df7ffed00034efd9a002c1,9,As she was shopping in the Jewish district.
60df7ffed00034efd9a002c1,10,And the shops were open longer.
60df7ffed00034efd9a002c1,11,When the narrator found their mother.
60df7ffed00034efd9a002c1,12,And told her what happened.
60df7ffed00034efd9a002c1,13,A police man came across them.
60df7ffed00034efd9a002c1,14,He said it was a bad area for them to be in.
60df7ffed00034efd9a002c1,15,But that he could not help them.
60df7ffed00034efd9a002c1,16,So they went to the police station.
60df7ffed00034efd9a002c1,17,To see who could help.
60df7ffed00034efd9a002c1,18,The captain said the same.
60df7ffed00034efd9a002c1,19,That he could not help.
60df7ffed00034efd9a002c1,20,And so the mother asked him to bring them home in the police patrol.
60df7ffed00034efd9a002c1,21,When they got home a crowd gathered.
60df7ffed00034efd9a002c1,22,And the mother said she had no money left to move anywhere else.
60df7ffed00034efd9a002c1,23,She had paid for a month.
60df7ffed00034efd9a002c1,24,And if the people did not want her there.
60df7ffed00034efd9a002c1,25,They would have to give her money.
60df7ffed00034efd9a002c1,26,So she could move somewhere else.
60df7ffed00034efd9a002c1,27,After that they had no more trouble.
60df7ffed00034efd9a002c1,28,The neighbours were very good to them.
60df7ffed00034efd9a002c1,29,When the father was sick.
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,1,We moved to Third and Wharton.
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,2,"I told you my father used to drink,"
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,3,so he went out.
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,4,"My mother went out to buy some food,"
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,5,leaving me alone with the kids.
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,6,Just after she had left I heard a loud crash.
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,7,I saw stones coming through the window.
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,8,I grabbed the kids
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,9,and hid in the stairs.
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,10,"I told them ""Stay here, nothing can reach you here."
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,11,"I'm going to try to find mom."""
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,12,"(We called our mother ""Mom"".)"
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,13,I was only 10 years old at the time.
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,14,"I was so scared walking towards the front door,"
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,15,I didn't know what I would see.
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,16,"There were shops nearby, in the Jewish neighbourhood."
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,17,They were open all hours because they tried to take what money they could get.
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,18,That's where my mother was.
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,19,There were carts on the street.
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,20,I ran up to my mother
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,21,and started telling her what happened.
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,22,A police officer went past.
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,23,I was so scared I could hardly be understood.
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,24,"The police officer stopped,"
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,25,he wanted to find out what had happened
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,26,and what was wrong with me.
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,27,He started speaking to my mother.
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,28,"""You're in a bad neighbourhood."
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,29,"There's nothing anyone can do for you,"
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,30,"the people there are Irish."""
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,31,He was Irish himself.
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,32,"""They don't want black people living there."""
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,33,But he didn't say black.
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,34,"""They don't want anyone in that house,"
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,35,"you should move."""
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,36,"""We can't move."" My mother said."
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,37,"""We don't have any money."
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,38,"If you can't do anything then tell me where your precinct is."""
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,39,We went to the police station where the officer worked.
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,40,We spoke to another police officer there.
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,41,"""You should move."" he said."
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,42,"A lot of black people were cowed and put down,"
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,43,"so they rarely spoke up for themselves,"
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,44,thankfully my mother was not like that.
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,45,"""We cannot afford to move,"
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,46,surely the estate agency should be held accountable if no one wants someone living in that house.
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,47,"Now if you're not willing to help,"
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,48,"I'll tell you what to do."""
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,49,"""What?"" asked the officer."
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,50,"""Drive me home."" Said my mother."
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,51,We were driven home by the police in a cart pulled by horses.
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,52,There were bells on the cart that would clang.
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,53,"Clang, clang, clang."
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,54,Everyone came out of their houses to see what the noise was over.
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,55,My mother stood up and spoke to everyone.
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,56,"She told them that we had no money,"
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,57,"we had paid rent for a month (we had to pay in advance),"
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,58,we didn't know what would happen in a month
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,59,but we couldn't leave before then.
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,60,She told them that we were different from them
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,61,but that didn't give them a reason to treat us badly.
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,62,"After that my father became ill,"
5e11a7d6feea8982dba1e61c,63,but the neighbours were as nice as they could be to us.
62e1975d947d5f6bcb8113bd,1,"We had just moved to a property on third and wharton,"
62e1975d947d5f6bcb8113bd,2,my father had just finished putting the furniture in when he had to leave to take the horses back.
62e1975d947d5f6bcb8113bd,3,my mother then left to go and get groceries leaving me alone with the kids.
62e1975d947d5f6bcb8113bd,4,My mother was going to get groceries in the jewish shops where they stay open all hours to get as much money as they can.
62e1975d947d5f6bcb8113bd,5,"There was a large crash and the kids were screaming,"
62e1975d947d5f6bcb8113bd,6,I ushered them under the stairs while I looked to see what it was.
62e1975d947d5f6bcb8113bd,7,A stone had been thrown through the window.
62e1975d947d5f6bcb8113bd,8,"I ran out of the house to find my mother,"
62e1975d947d5f6bcb8113bd,9,"I was so scared,"
62e1975d947d5f6bcb8113bd,10,"I ran and ran and found her on forth street,"
62e1975d947d5f6bcb8113bd,11,I was speaking so low that a passing policeman stopped to see what had happened.
62e1975d947d5f6bcb8113bd,12,"My mother asked what he was going to do about it,"
62e1975d947d5f6bcb8113bd,13,"he said nothing,"
62e1975d947d5f6bcb8113bd,14,my mother asked why not as I paid rent for that property and I have no more money.
62e1975d947d5f6bcb8113bd,15,"She asked who could help,"
62e1975d947d5f6bcb8113bd,16,he said no one can.
62e1975d947d5f6bcb8113bd,17,My mother asked for the precinct to get them to help.
62e1975d947d5f6bcb8113bd,18,My mother was an educated black woman who qualified from high school in 1925.
62e1975d947d5f6bcb8113bd,19,We went to the precinct and they said they cannot help
62e1975d947d5f6bcb8113bd,20,"so my mother said you can take us home,"
62e1975d947d5f6bcb8113bd,21,they did so in the wagon that was pulled by horses with a bell that went clang.
62e1975d947d5f6bcb8113bd,22,When we stopped there was a step that was put to the back so we could get out
62e1975d947d5f6bcb8113bd,23,and all the neighbours had come out to see what happened.
62e1975d947d5f6bcb8113bd,24,My mother told them that she had paid rent for a month and had no more money
62e1975d947d5f6bcb8113bd,25,so she was going to stay for the month
62e1975d947d5f6bcb8113bd,26,and if they didn't want us stay then they could pay our rent for us to leave.
62e1975d947d5f6bcb8113bd,27,After that my father got sick
62e1975d947d5f6bcb8113bd,28,and our neighbours helped us.
60c00052c391140811ca1d54,1,They moved to third.
60c00052c391140811ca1d54,2,It was day my father drank and took the horses.
60c00052c391140811ca1d54,3,I was left with kids.
60c00052c391140811ca1d54,4,I was 10 years old my father said they are terrible neighbours.
60c00052c391140811ca1d54,5,We went to the police station to report but they said we must leave.
60c00052c391140811ca1d54,6,Because I said no my mother was an educated person.
5d336b07d343a00016536032,1,This person first started on Wharton.
5d336b07d343a00016536032,2,Their father was at a furniture store.
5d336b07d343a00016536032,3,One day people started throwing stones at their house.
5d336b07d343a00016536032,4,(presumably because they were black and unwanted in the community).
5d336b07d343a00016536032,5,"Given this and the color of the family's skin, they are told that they will be evicted."
5d336b07d343a00016536032,6,The narrator's mother fights against this eviction.
5d336b07d343a00016536032,7,The mother argues that she already paid this month's rent and doesn't have money to pay for rent elsewhere.
5d336b07d343a00016536032,8,"The mother states that this is their home for the month, even if it might not be in the next (because where will the money come from)."
5d336b07d343a00016536032,9,"The mother even says that she doesn't have the money to pay to replace the windows that were shattered by the stones, which will be rough given that it is the winter time."
5d336b07d343a00016536032,10,"However, the apartment is still home and unless people give her money to leave then this is where she will be for the month."
5d336b07d343a00016536032,11,For the narrator this was a traumatizing experience.
5b8ba037bca3400001fad37a,1,They moved to third and wharton.
5b8ba037bca3400001fad37a,2,Mother went out shopping to fourth street.
5b8ba037bca3400001fad37a,3,Father was also out of the house.
5b8ba037bca3400001fad37a,4,"When they were out of the house the storyteller who was ten at the time, recalled of stones smashing the windows."
5b8ba037bca3400001fad37a,5,They moved to other parts of the house for safety.
5b8ba037bca3400001fad37a,6,Then ran out of the house.
5b8ba037bca3400001fad37a,7,They were scared that they were going to get hit by something.
5b8ba037bca3400001fad37a,8,She finally met her mother.
5b8ba037bca3400001fad37a,9,She was that upset she could barely make out what she was saying.
5b8ba037bca3400001fad37a,10,A passing police officer stopped to talk and find out what was wrong.
5b8ba037bca3400001fad37a,11,"Her mother was very assertive, which was not common among black people of the day."
5b8ba037bca3400001fad37a,12,The policeman had said there was nothing he can do.
5b8ba037bca3400001fad37a,13,And that it was an irish neighbourhood that was known for trouble.
5b8ba037bca3400001fad37a,14,He advised her to move house.
5b8ba037bca3400001fad37a,15,The policeman was also irish.
5b8ba037bca3400001fad37a,16,She recalled of how she though her mother was educated and that she finished high school.
5b8ba037bca3400001fad37a,17,She went to lakawana high school and finished in 1925.
5b8ba037bca3400001fad37a,18,The mother wasnt happy with the policemans response.
5b8ba037bca3400001fad37a,19,She asked what precinct he worked out of.
5b8ba037bca3400001fad37a,20,The mother went to the precinct on fifth street and spoke to the captain.
5b8ba037bca3400001fad37a,21,She recalled of seeing lots of police patrols and horses.
5b8ba037bca3400001fad37a,22,The captain was equally unhelpful.
5b8ba037bca3400001fad37a,23,Saying that because they never seen who threw the stones there is nothing they can do.
5b8ba037bca3400001fad37a,24,The mother spoke loud and long.
5b8ba037bca3400001fad37a,25,The captain hadnt dealt with someone like this before.
5b8ba037bca3400001fad37a,26,The mother then asked for a police patrol to give her a lift home.
5b8ba037bca3400001fad37a,27,When she got home there was a crowd waiting for her.
5b8ba037bca3400001fad37a,28,She spoke to the crowd.
5b8ba037bca3400001fad37a,29,Letting them know that they paid for the rent in advance for a month.
5b8ba037bca3400001fad37a,30,And dont have enough money to move.
5b8ba037bca3400001fad37a,31,"Telling them that apart from the colour of her skin, she was the same as them."
5b8ba037bca3400001fad37a,32,And if they want her to move they would have to provide the money as she couldnt afford to move out.
5b8ba037bca3400001fad37a,33,She was just trying to make a home for her family.
5b8ba037bca3400001fad37a,34,Her father got sick during this time.
5b8ba037bca3400001fad37a,35,The neighbours were now really helpful and looked out for them.
5b8ba037bca3400001fad37a,36,Whenever there was any other trouble the neighbours would come out and help them.
5ed931982fb618499fb90bc6,1,"Father was an alcoholic,"
5ed931982fb618499fb90bc6,2,"people were throwing things at the house,"
5ed931982fb618499fb90bc6,3,involving sharp glass.
5ed931982fb618499fb90bc6,4,I gathered the kids
5ed931982fb618499fb90bc6,5,and got them out
5ed931982fb618499fb90bc6,6,because it wasn't safe.
5ed931982fb618499fb90bc6,7,I was only 10 years old.
5ed931982fb618499fb90bc6,8,"I went to find my mother,"
5ed931982fb618499fb90bc6,9,she was shopping in the Jewish district.
5ed931982fb618499fb90bc6,10,We spoke to a policeman
5ed931982fb618499fb90bc6,11,who was Irish
5ed931982fb618499fb90bc6,12,and he said its not safe for us in the area.
5ed931982fb618499fb90bc6,13,"The Irish people of the area do not like Black people,"
5ed931982fb618499fb90bc6,14,although he did not use that term.
5ed931982fb618499fb90bc6,15,He asked me if I saw who did it
5ed931982fb618499fb90bc6,16,I said I hadn't
5ed931982fb618499fb90bc6,17,and he said therefore he cant do anything
5ed931982fb618499fb90bc6,18,because there is no one to blame.
5ed931982fb618499fb90bc6,19,Then we saw another lady
5ed931982fb618499fb90bc6,20,who said if they give her enough money she will move away
5ed931982fb618499fb90bc6,21,but she said they will not have enough money
5ed931982fb618499fb90bc6,22,so we will have to live like this.
5ed931982fb618499fb90bc6,23,Then my dad got sick.
64e603dd69223a81a990ae76,1,The story starts off with the main character moving to a new neighbourhood.
64e603dd69223a81a990ae76,2,"The main plot about one day when her father was drinking,"
64e603dd69223a81a990ae76,3,someone threw a rock through the window.
64e603dd69223a81a990ae76,4,The main character was very scared.
64e603dd69223a81a990ae76,5,They reported the situation to the police.
64e603dd69223a81a990ae76,6,They live largely in a Jewish neighbourhood
64e603dd69223a81a990ae76,7,and the police immediately attributed the crime to racism.
64e603dd69223a81a990ae76,8,They blamed Irish and black people.
64e603dd69223a81a990ae76,9,This became a big issue in the neighborhood
64e603dd69223a81a990ae76,10,and people felt unsafe.
64e603dd69223a81a990ae76,11,"Due to this, the main character moves to a new neighborhood"
64e603dd69223a81a990ae76,12,which is more friendly and less racist.
5b618aef12bf660001275c5d,1,A girl was in a house with her siblings
5b618aef12bf660001275c5d,2,when stones were being thrown through the window
5b618aef12bf660001275c5d,3,so she told her siblings to hide
5b618aef12bf660001275c5d,4,while she went to the town
5b618aef12bf660001275c5d,5,and found her mother
5b618aef12bf660001275c5d,6,and as she was telling her
5b618aef12bf660001275c5d,7,a policeman walked by
5b618aef12bf660001275c5d,8,and heard the commotion
5b618aef12bf660001275c5d,9,so stopped to ask what happened
5b618aef12bf660001275c5d,10,and they told him
5b618aef12bf660001275c5d,11,and he basically refused to do anything about it
5b618aef12bf660001275c5d,12,as the family were black
5b618aef12bf660001275c5d,13,and the Irish didn't like them
5b618aef12bf660001275c5d,14,the mother decided to go to the police station
5b618aef12bf660001275c5d,15,to talk to someone else
5b618aef12bf660001275c5d,16,and they agreed to take them back home in the patrol car
5b618aef12bf660001275c5d,17,so the people would see that
5b618aef12bf660001275c5d,18,and leave them alone
5b618aef12bf660001275c5d,19,which they did
5b618aef12bf660001275c5d,20,and became helpful when their dad was ill.
63ced390ffb149038641f677,1,A black Jewish family had moved in to a new home.
63ced390ffb149038641f677,2,The father was out drinking
63ced390ffb149038641f677,3,and the mother was shopping.
63ced390ffb149038641f677,4,The house got attacked with stones breaking the windows
63ced390ffb149038641f677,5,the oldest of the children hid the other 2 siblings in a cupboard away from the flying glass
63ced390ffb149038641f677,6,so they wouldn't get hurt.
63ced390ffb149038641f677,7,"The eldest sibling ran out of the house,"
63ced390ffb149038641f677,8,frightened and looking for there mum.
63ced390ffb149038641f677,9,They found there mum down the street
63ced390ffb149038641f677,10,where there mum was shopping
63ced390ffb149038641f677,11,and tried to explain in tears what had happened.
63ced390ffb149038641f677,12,A passing police man heard the commotion
63ced390ffb149038641f677,13,and came and asked what was wrong.
63ced390ffb149038641f677,14,They explained that they were a new family in the area
63ced390ffb149038641f677,15,and there house was being attacked.
63ced390ffb149038641f677,16,The police man explained that this would happen to this black family as they lived in a Irish area.
63ced390ffb149038641f677,17,The mother was disgusted to learn the police wouldn't help
63ced390ffb149038641f677,18,so wanted to see the captain.
63ced390ffb149038641f677,19,The mum and child was taken to the station
63ced390ffb149038641f677,20,and pleaded there case to the captain
63ced390ffb149038641f677,21,but was told exactly the same that the police wouldn't help
63ced390ffb149038641f677,22,and the only solution was to move away.
63ced390ffb149038641f677,23,The mother had payed a month's Renton the house
63ced390ffb149038641f677,24,and had no money left.
63ced390ffb149038641f677,25,She demanded that herself and her child to be taken back in the horse drawn wagon.
63ced390ffb149038641f677,26,As they sat in the back neighbours appeared as they arrived at there house.
63ced390ffb149038641f677,27,The mother exclaimed so the neighbours could hear that they had been attacked
63ced390ffb149038641f677,28,and if the group of people who didn't want them there they should get together and give then the money to move
63ced390ffb149038641f677,29,as she didn't have the money to leave.
63ced390ffb149038641f677,30,Also stating that now they would be cold as there windows were broken
63ced390ffb149038641f677,31,and she couldn't afford to fix them.
63ced390ffb149038641f677,32,The neighbours had seem to change there mind once the dad got ill
63ced390ffb149038641f677,33,and all came together to help the black family
63ced390ffb149038641f677,34,and were now friendly to the family.
5ffd80c185e28327669b51f5,1,it a story about a family with one kid
5ffd80c185e28327669b51f5,2,who was 10 years old at the time
5ffd80c185e28327669b51f5,3,a mother and father
5ffd80c185e28327669b51f5,4,and they moved in to place
5ffd80c185e28327669b51f5,5,where black people were not treated ok
5ffd80c185e28327669b51f5,6,and one day an incident happened to them
5ffd80c185e28327669b51f5,7,and they went to report this issue
5ffd80c185e28327669b51f5,8,but they did not get the help they thought they would get
5ffd80c185e28327669b51f5,9,they were basically told to move from that place
5ffd80c185e28327669b51f5,10,but they couldn't
5ffd80c185e28327669b51f5,11,because they had no money
63e52debbbb982734deba89a,1,A black family had recently moved into a new neighbourhood of predominantly Irish people.
63e52debbbb982734deba89a,2,This was in the 1920s.
63e52debbbb982734deba89a,3,The father went out (he tended to drink) and left his wife and children at home.
63e52debbbb982734deba89a,4,It was evening time.
63e52debbbb982734deba89a,5,The mother needed to go and get some food so went out to the Jewish shop that stayed open longest.
63e52debbbb982734deba89a,6,She told the eldest child who was 10 to look after the younger children.
63e52debbbb982734deba89a,7,Suddenly there was a crash that scared the children greatly.
63e52debbbb982734deba89a,8,The eldest hurried the children under the stairwell for protection and told them to stay there and that they would be safe.
63e52debbbb982734deba89a,9,A stone had been thrown through their house window.
63e52debbbb982734deba89a,10,"The child was scared but went out to find their mother, correctly guessing where she would be and told her what had happened."
63e52debbbb982734deba89a,11,She was angry and aggrieved at the unfairness of it.
63e52debbbb982734deba89a,12,They were black but they paid their rent like everyone else.
63e52debbbb982734deba89a,13,If they didn't want them there why had they allowed them to rent.
63e52debbbb982734deba89a,14,There was a policeman passing and the mother stopped him asking for him to come and help find who had done this.
63e52debbbb982734deba89a,15,Although he was sympathetic to a degree he said the only thing he could suggest was that they moved somewhere else.
63e52debbbb982734deba89a,16,The mother said she had paid the rent for a month and there was no way she would move.
63e52debbbb982734deba89a,17,Her job as a mother was to protect her children.
63e52debbbb982734deba89a,18,The child was proud of his mother who was educated and strong.
63e52debbbb982734deba89a,19,As the policeman would not help she asked to be taken to someone more senior who could help.
63e52debbbb982734deba89a,20,Again the answer was that all that they could suggest was that she move.
63e52debbbb982734deba89a,21,She and the child were taken in the horse drawn police wagon back home.
63e52debbbb982734deba89a,22,The clanging of the bell alerted the neighbourhood who came out to watch what was happening.
63e52debbbb982734deba89a,23,The mother alighted and spoke to them saying that apart from the colour of their skin they were all the same.
63e52debbbb982734deba89a,24,She had paid rent for a month and she was staying for a month.
63e52debbbb982734deba89a,25,If they wanted to move her they could pay her rent to live elsewhere.
63e52debbbb982734deba89a,26,A while later the father became ill and the people in the neighbourhood behaved towards the family with kindness and empathy.
584c8539e964030001c316fb,1,It is 1925
584c8539e964030001c316fb,2,and coloured boy 10 years old moved into an Irish neighbourhood with his family
584c8539e964030001c316fb,3,while his mum and dad were out
584c8539e964030001c316fb,4,he was left with his siblings
584c8539e964030001c316fb,5,some one threw a stone through the window
584c8539e964030001c316fb,6,so he hid his siblings under the stairs
584c8539e964030001c316fb,7,while he went to search for his mother
584c8539e964030001c316fb,8,he thinks she went to the Jewish neighbourhood
584c8539e964030001c316fb,9,as the shops stayed open longer there
584c8539e964030001c316fb,10,he found his mother
584c8539e964030001c316fb,11,"who informed a police officer,"
584c8539e964030001c316fb,12,who said they could not do any thing
584c8539e964030001c316fb,13,and the Irish people probably did not want them living there.
584c8539e964030001c316fb,14,The boys mother explained she had paid a months rent to the real estate agent
584c8539e964030001c316fb,15,and could not afford to move.
584c8539e964030001c316fb,16,she persuaded the police officer to give her and her son a lift home
584c8539e964030001c316fb,17,in the horse drawn police wagon that went clang.
584c8539e964030001c316fb,18,When she was dropped of in her neighbour hood
584c8539e964030001c316fb,19,all the neighbours were watching as she got out.
584c8539e964030001c316fb,20,She told the neighbours if they wanted her to leave they would have to club together and give her the money to move to some where else.
584c8539e964030001c316fb,21,while they were living at the house
584c8539e964030001c316fb,22,the boys father feel ill
584c8539e964030001c316fb,23,all the neighbours helped out.
5c0239caecc5660001424ed6,1,A Black family moved to a new neighbourhood.
5c0239caecc5660001424ed6,2,Someone smashed a window in the family's home.
5c0239caecc5660001424ed6,3,It was an Irish area.
5c0239caecc5660001424ed6,4,They didn't want any Black people there.
5c0239caecc5660001424ed6,5,The mother called the police.
5c0239caecc5660001424ed6,6,They would not do anything.
5c0239caecc5660001424ed6,7,So the mother went to the police station to complain.
5c0239caecc5660001424ed6,8,Again the police said they could do nothing.
5c0239caecc5660001424ed6,9,They had no evidence.
5c0239caecc5660001424ed6,10,"When the mother got back from the station, she said to the neighbours that no matter what they did, she and her family would be staying there for at least a month."
5c0239caecc5660001424ed6,11,She had paid for a month.
5c0239caecc5660001424ed6,12,She could not afford to move again unless the people paid her to leave.
5c0239caecc5660001424ed6,13,This is something they would not do.
5c0239caecc5660001424ed6,14,They probably could not afford to do.
5c0239caecc5660001424ed6,15,"In the end, it turned out ok."
5c0239caecc5660001424ed6,16,The family got on well with the neighbours.
5e356b29d87fbf512a4cd090,1,"We moved to Wharton,"
5e356b29d87fbf512a4cd090,2,my mum went to the shops.
5e356b29d87fbf512a4cd090,3,There where horses in the road.
5e356b29d87fbf512a4cd090,4,Somebody stoned our house
5e356b29d87fbf512a4cd090,5,and broke all the windows.
5e356b29d87fbf512a4cd090,6,I went to find my mother
5e356b29d87fbf512a4cd090,7,who was working in the jewish district.
5e356b29d87fbf512a4cd090,8,I could barely speak when I found my mother.
5e356b29d87fbf512a4cd090,9,She was good at talking.
5e356b29d87fbf512a4cd090,10,"Called the police about the stoning of the windows in the house,"
5e356b29d87fbf512a4cd090,11,we thought it was because we were black.
5e356b29d87fbf512a4cd090,12,My mum said to the neighbours we are just like you.
5e356b29d87fbf512a4cd090,13,"The policeman said we could move,"
5e356b29d87fbf512a4cd090,14,my mum said no.
5e356b29d87fbf512a4cd090,15,"She said they had rented the house for one month,"
5e356b29d87fbf512a4cd090,16,if the neighbours did not like it they could pay for the windows
5e356b29d87fbf512a4cd090,17,"because my mum said she had no money,"
5e356b29d87fbf512a4cd090,18,neither did the neighbours.
5e356b29d87fbf512a4cd090,19,My father got sick
5e356b29d87fbf512a4cd090,20,and the neighbours were kind.
5a3adfb705f005000104d2a3,1,"Lived in Third and Warton,"
5a3adfb705f005000104d2a3,2,his father was an alcoholic
5a3adfb705f005000104d2a3,3,and fled on a horse.
5a3adfb705f005000104d2a3,4,There was a loud crash
5a3adfb705f005000104d2a3,5,in which someone was throwing stones at their windows.
5a3adfb705f005000104d2a3,6,"The father rushed the kids under the stairway,"
5a3adfb705f005000104d2a3,7,the narrator was only 10 at the time.
5a3adfb705f005000104d2a3,8,This is when his father took off.
5a3adfb705f005000104d2a3,9,"They moved to fourth street,"
5a3adfb705f005000104d2a3,10,"a Jewish town,"
5a3adfb705f005000104d2a3,11,"in which his mother went to a policeman,"
5a3adfb705f005000104d2a3,12,"who was Irish,"
5a3adfb705f005000104d2a3,13,to try and find out who was throwing stones.
5a3adfb705f005000104d2a3,14,"It was a mixed race community,"
5a3adfb705f005000104d2a3,15,"which caused lots of trouble,"
5a3adfb705f005000104d2a3,16,"where the black men cowed,"
5a3adfb705f005000104d2a3,17,although they weren't allowed to call them black.
5a3adfb705f005000104d2a3,18,The policeman said she doesn't know who to blame
5a3adfb705f005000104d2a3,19,so it's pointless
5a3adfb705f005000104d2a3,20,and his only advised was that she moved.
5a3adfb705f005000104d2a3,21,His mother was very poor
5a3adfb705f005000104d2a3,22,and could only afford 1 months rent
5a3adfb705f005000104d2a3,23,but she knew she was staying put despite not having a lot of money.
5a3adfb705f005000104d2a3,24,At the Narrators age of 24/25 he went to fifth street.
5a3adfb705f005000104d2a3,25,"There was more policeman here with horse wagons,"
5a3adfb705f005000104d2a3,26,they said there was nothing they could do about these stones.
5a3adfb705f005000104d2a3,27,The narrator was terrified at such a young age.
5d080cac3ba4580019731a79,1,"A 10 year old child moved into a new neighbourhood with their mum, dad and siblings."
5d080cac3ba4580019731a79,2,"Just after moving in the mother decided she had to pop out for some shopping,"
5d080cac3ba4580019731a79,3,so off she went.
5d080cac3ba4580019731a79,4,The father then decided he had to out too.
5d080cac3ba4580019731a79,5,"So the children were left alone in new home,"
5d080cac3ba4580019731a79,6,all by themselves.
5d080cac3ba4580019731a79,7,Suddenly rocks and stones were being thrown at the front room windows.
5d080cac3ba4580019731a79,8,The child took her brothers and sisters and hid under the stairs.
5d080cac3ba4580019731a79,9,When the noise stopped she took out the children and went to find the policemen.
5d080cac3ba4580019731a79,10,When the mother was located she was very angry and spoke to a policeman
5d080cac3ba4580019731a79,11,"who told her she needed to move house,"
5d080cac3ba4580019731a79,12,however the mother argued that she had no money to move house.
5d080cac3ba4580019731a79,13,She asked the policeman to take them home.
5d080cac3ba4580019731a79,14,On arriving home the neighbours all came out of their homes to look at who was being driven home by the police.
5d080cac3ba4580019731a79,15,The mother then explained the situation she was in.
5d080cac3ba4580019731a79,16,If the neighbours wanted the family to leave they must all give her money to do so.
5d080cac3ba4580019731a79,17,"She went onto explain that she wanted to make a home for her family just like themselves,"
5d080cac3ba4580019731a79,18,even though her family had different coloured skin to them they were just the same as any other family.
5e852dd84fc423121601a0f8,1,There was a ten-year-old child
5e852dd84fc423121601a0f8,2,who was babysitting one day
5e852dd84fc423121601a0f8,3,"when, out of nowhere, something struck the window."
5e852dd84fc423121601a0f8,4,"Their parents were not at home,"
5e852dd84fc423121601a0f8,5,and they lived in a Jewish neighborhood.
5e852dd84fc423121601a0f8,6,"Startled by the incident,"
5e852dd84fc423121601a0f8,7,the child quickly gathered the other kids
5e852dd84fc423121601a0f8,8,and moved them to safety.
5e852dd84fc423121601a0f8,9,The child then decided to investigate what had hit the window.
5e852dd84fc423121601a0f8,10,"While searching for their mom at a nearby store,"
5e852dd84fc423121601a0f8,11,they caught the attention of an Irish police officer.
5e852dd84fc423121601a0f8,12,The officer inquired why the child appeared scared.
5e852dd84fc423121601a0f8,13,When the mom finally arrived
5e852dd84fc423121601a0f8,14,"and learned about the incident,"
5e852dd84fc423121601a0f8,15,she asked the officer for assistance.
5e852dd84fc423121601a0f8,16,"However, the officer regretfully responded, ""I can't do anything about it."""
5e852dd84fc423121601a0f8,17,The mom became upset
5e852dd84fc423121601a0f8,18,and requested the officer's captain's name
5e852dd84fc423121601a0f8,19,so she could discuss the matter at the police station.
5e852dd84fc423121601a0f8,20,"Upon speaking to the police captain,"
5e852dd84fc423121601a0f8,21,she was met with a similar response.
5e852dd84fc423121601a0f8,22,"The captain explained that their hands were tied,"
5e852dd84fc423121601a0f8,23,and they couldn't take any action.
5e852dd84fc423121601a0f8,24,"Frustrated, the mom expressed her inability to move out of the neighborhood"
5e852dd84fc423121601a0f8,25,due to financial constraints.
600ed894271cf07f30826df6,1,A black family moves to Third and Wharton
600ed894271cf07f30826df6,2,and their house is attacked by neighbours throwing rocks through their windows.
600ed894271cf07f30826df6,3,"The mother goes out to get police help,"
600ed894271cf07f30826df6,4,but the police officer blames the issue on the Irish neighbourhood
600ed894271cf07f30826df6,5,and advises that the family move.
600ed894271cf07f30826df6,6,The mother says she can't
600ed894271cf07f30826df6,7,and asks where the officer's precinct is.
600ed894271cf07f30826df6,8,He tells her
600ed894271cf07f30826df6,9,"and she goes there to speak to the captain,"
600ed894271cf07f30826df6,10,who also tells her that there is nothing he can do except to advise her to move.
600ed894271cf07f30826df6,11,She tells him she has no money as the rent is paid in advance for her home.
600ed894271cf07f30826df6,12,She asks the captain for a ride home
600ed894271cf07f30826df6,13,"and once she arrives home,"
600ed894271cf07f30826df6,14,she tells her neighbours her situation
600ed894271cf07f30826df6,15,"and after that they were kind neighbours,"
600ed894271cf07f30826df6,16,even helping when the father became ill.
5f392fae9168cc472f0468f6,1,"One evening when we lived on the corner of 4th and Westbuty my father went out with the team of horses,"
5f392fae9168cc472f0468f6,2,and then my mother went out
5f392fae9168cc472f0468f6,3,and I was there.
5f392fae9168cc472f0468f6,4,There was a huge crash
5f392fae9168cc472f0468f6,5,and a stone came through the window.
5f392fae9168cc472f0468f6,6,I took the others under the stairs
5f392fae9168cc472f0468f6,7,"and I said you stay there,"
5f392fae9168cc472f0468f6,8,"I'm gonna get Mam,"
5f392fae9168cc472f0468f6,9,we called our mother mam in those days.
5f392fae9168cc472f0468f6,10,I knew she would be shopping somewhere on fourth
5f392fae9168cc472f0468f6,11,because there were shops there
5f392fae9168cc472f0468f6,12,and they kept open late
5f392fae9168cc472f0468f6,13,because they - jews - wanted to make as much as they could.
5f392fae9168cc472f0468f6,14,I found her there
5f392fae9168cc472f0468f6,15,and told her.
5f392fae9168cc472f0468f6,16,There was a policeman there
5f392fae9168cc472f0468f6,17,and my voice was so low and shaky
5f392fae9168cc472f0468f6,18,that he asked what the problem was.
5f392fae9168cc472f0468f6,19,My mother told him
5f392fae9168cc472f0468f6,20,and asked him what he could do.
5f392fae9168cc472f0468f6,21,"I can't do nothing, he said"
5f392fae9168cc472f0468f6,22,"the Irish don't like a black living there - he didn't use the work black, it wasn't used then."
5f392fae9168cc472f0468f6,23,"So what can i do, my mother said."
5f392fae9168cc472f0468f6,24,You'll have to move he said.
5f392fae9168cc472f0468f6,25,"I can't move she said,"
5f392fae9168cc472f0468f6,26,I don't have any money.
5f392fae9168cc472f0468f6,27,I paid rent in advance so I just can't move.
5f392fae9168cc472f0468f6,28,Why did they let me rent it if they don't want us there.
5f392fae9168cc472f0468f6,29,Where is your precinct.
5f392fae9168cc472f0468f6,30,He told us
5f392fae9168cc472f0468f6,31,and we went there.
5f392fae9168cc472f0468f6,32,"Captain, she said, what can you do."
5f392fae9168cc472f0468f6,33,"Nothing he said, I'm Irish too, all you can do is move."
5f392fae9168cc472f0468f6,34,I can't move she said.
5f392fae9168cc472f0468f6,35,"I'll tell you one thing you can do for us, take us there in your horse and wagon."
5f392fae9168cc472f0468f6,36,"He said yes, probably he just wanted to get rid of this woman."
5f392fae9168cc472f0468f6,37,He hadn't seen anyone like her before.
5f392fae9168cc472f0468f6,38,She was the only black woman I knew who had finished High School.
5f392fae9168cc472f0468f6,39,We sat in back of the carriage
5f392fae9168cc472f0468f6,40,and the bell went Clang clang.
5f392fae9168cc472f0468f6,41,"You know those trams go Clang, well this went Clang Clang Clang."
5f392fae9168cc472f0468f6,42,When we got to the house the policeman opened the long back door
5f392fae9168cc472f0468f6,43,and we had to walk down the steps.
5f392fae9168cc472f0468f6,44,A crowd was looking at us.
5f392fae9168cc472f0468f6,45,My mother said.
5f392fae9168cc472f0468f6,46,I can't afford to move from here for a month because I paid rent in advance.
5f392fae9168cc472f0468f6,47,It's winter and cold.
5f392fae9168cc472f0468f6,48,I can't afford to new windows.
5f392fae9168cc472f0468f6,49,I'm just like you except for skin wise.
5f392fae9168cc472f0468f6,50,I am just the same.
5f392fae9168cc472f0468f6,51,So they just accepted us from then on
5f392fae9168cc472f0468f6,52,and when my father got sick they all helped
5f392fae9168cc472f0468f6,53,and treated us just like one of them.
5f392fae9168cc472f0468f6,54,The year probably was nineteen twenty five.
5c98310742270c0014d0287a,1,This person lives with their parents and siblings.
5c98310742270c0014d0287a,2,This person's mother went shopping.
5c98310742270c0014d0287a,3,Father went somewhere.
5c98310742270c0014d0287a,4,People threw rocks at their house.
5c98310742270c0014d0287a,5,The narrator ran to mom at 4th street.
5c98310742270c0014d0287a,6,There were horses.
5c98310742270c0014d0287a,7,On the way there the narrator saw a policeman.
5c98310742270c0014d0287a,8,They lived in an Irish neighborhood.
5c98310742270c0014d0287a,9,Where blacks were not welcome.
5c98310742270c0014d0287a,10,The mom asked the policeman what they can do.
5c98310742270c0014d0287a,11,Nothing could be done.
5c98310742270c0014d0287a,12,They went to the police station.
5c98310742270c0014d0287a,13,The chief said to move out.
5c98310742270c0014d0287a,14,But they had already paid their rent for the month.
5c98310742270c0014d0287a,15,And did not have any money to go anywhere else.
5c98310742270c0014d0287a,16,So she suggested that if people wanted them gone they get enough money to move out.
5c98310742270c0014d0287a,17,But those people probably didn't have money either.
60bab50bcdd5d7ad3ee97479,1,"The story was based in a Jewish neighbourhood,"
60bab50bcdd5d7ad3ee97479,2,in which a policeman recalls to be a dangerous neighbourhood.
60bab50bcdd5d7ad3ee97479,3,Apparently black people aren't allowed to live there.
60bab50bcdd5d7ad3ee97479,4,Their mother went out to the market
60bab50bcdd5d7ad3ee97479,5,while they hid under the stairs to avoid the flying glass.
60bab50bcdd5d7ad3ee97479,6,"They were all scared,"
60bab50bcdd5d7ad3ee97479,7,but the narrator went to find their mother.
60bab50bcdd5d7ad3ee97479,8,"Along the way she spoke to a policeman,"
60bab50bcdd5d7ad3ee97479,9,who said everything about the neighbourhood.
60bab50bcdd5d7ad3ee97479,10,"Later on, the father had to go until hospital."
60bab50bcdd5d7ad3ee97479,11,"Overall, it was quite a frighening story"
60bab50bcdd5d7ad3ee97479,12,as reflected upon towards the end by the narrator.
62e952d57a788507f98964ba,1,We had to go to Wharton.
62e952d57a788507f98964ba,2,The house was stoned
62e952d57a788507f98964ba,3,and there was flying glass everywhere.
62e952d57a788507f98964ba,4,I had to make sure the kids were safe
62e952d57a788507f98964ba,5,but I couldn't find mom.
62e952d57a788507f98964ba,6,We ended up in a Jewish neighborhood
62e952d57a788507f98964ba,7,and was told they didn't like black people there.
62e952d57a788507f98964ba,8,At that time you didn't say black people
62e952d57a788507f98964ba,9,so they said they didn't like other people there.
5cb3d74a0225590017acda81,1,the window got smashed
5cb3d74a0225590017acda81,2,they were very scared
5cb3d74a0225590017acda81,3,and voice was shaking
5cb3d74a0225590017acda81,4,they ran to get his mum
5cb3d74a0225590017acda81,5,and the police told the mum
5cb3d74a0225590017acda81,6,they should move
5cb3d74a0225590017acda81,7,because it's full of Irish people
606f18e0f46c7435dd00838c,1,A brother and his siblings were left home by their parents.
606f18e0f46c7435dd00838c,2,Some unknown people threw stones at the windows of their home.
606f18e0f46c7435dd00838c,3,This frightened the 10-year-old and his sisters.
606f18e0f46c7435dd00838c,4,He got them to a safe spot on the stairway.
606f18e0f46c7435dd00838c,5,He went about to look for his mother.
606f18e0f46c7435dd00838c,6,He found her at some Jewish shop doing some grocery shopping.
606f18e0f46c7435dd00838c,7,He relayed the story of what had happened to his mother.
606f18e0f46c7435dd00838c,8,There was a police officer in the vicinity.
606f18e0f46c7435dd00838c,9,The boy told the cop what had happened.
606f18e0f46c7435dd00838c,10,The cop said there was nothing they could do about it.
606f18e0f46c7435dd00838c,11,The cop suggested that the boy and his mother move to another neighborhood.
606f18e0f46c7435dd00838c,12,"Since the area was Irish, the boy and his mother were black."
606f18e0f46c7435dd00838c,13,The boy's mother refused to move.
606f18e0f46c7435dd00838c,14,She requested to be taken to the precinct to speak to someone else who could help her.
606f18e0f46c7435dd00838c,15,They got on a horse cart as this was back in the 1925s.
606f18e0f46c7435dd00838c,16,"At the precinct, she was told the same story about not being able to be assisted."
606f18e0f46c7435dd00838c,17,Especially with the identity of the perpetrators not being known.
606f18e0f46c7435dd00838c,18,"After realizing that she was not getting the help she required, she asked to be escorted back home by the police patrol."
606f18e0f46c7435dd00838c,19,The police patrol had a bell that clanged.
606f18e0f46c7435dd00838c,20,The clanging noise aroused the curiosity of the neighbors.
606f18e0f46c7435dd00838c,21,They came out of their homes to see what was happening.
606f18e0f46c7435dd00838c,22,She got out and addressed them.
606f18e0f46c7435dd00838c,23,"She told them that unless they were willing to make donations towards her getting her down payment for her monthly rent for the house, there was no way she was going anywhere."
606f18e0f46c7435dd00838c,24,She couldn't afford to pay rent elsewhere for at least a month.
606f18e0f46c7435dd00838c,25,So she was stuck with them and they were stuck with her for at least a month until she could find somewhere else.
606f18e0f46c7435dd00838c,26,That was their welcoming into the neighborhood.
606f18e0f46c7435dd00838c,27,"From then, neighbors started warming up to them."
606f18e0f46c7435dd00838c,28,They would step in to help whenever something happened.
606f18e0f46c7435dd00838c,29,Even the boy's father got ill.
5b0e8d65d282ff00015bb9d1,1,A family moved into an Irish community in 1925
5b0e8d65d282ff00015bb9d1,2,and the father went out to the horses
5b0e8d65d282ff00015bb9d1,3,and the mother went shopping to 4 th street
5b0e8d65d282ff00015bb9d1,4,which was a Jewish area.
5b0e8d65d282ff00015bb9d1,5,While array the 10 year old looked after the others.
5b0e8d65d282ff00015bb9d1,6,Someone put a brick through the window.
5b0e8d65d282ff00015bb9d1,7,They hid under the stairs.
5b0e8d65d282ff00015bb9d1,8,The 10 year old went to find his mother
5b0e8d65d282ff00015bb9d1,9,and also told a policeman what had happened.
5b0e8d65d282ff00015bb9d1,10,The family had paid a months rent
5b0e8d65d282ff00015bb9d1,11,so couldn’t afford to move.
5b0e8d65d282ff00015bb9d1,12,They went to the police station
5b0e8d65d282ff00015bb9d1,13,and were brought home in the police patrol.
5b0e8d65d282ff00015bb9d1,14,The mother who was black told the neighbours she was staying a month
5b0e8d65d282ff00015bb9d1,15,unless they paid her the money to move on.
636419013bc521fae9f7db90,1,A black family moved into a neighborhood.
636419013bc521fae9f7db90,2,One day something was thrown into the window.
636419013bc521fae9f7db90,3,[Something] shattered the glass.
636419013bc521fae9f7db90,4,The narrator - a child - ran.
636419013bc521fae9f7db90,5,[The child] found their mother.
636419013bc521fae9f7db90,6,[The mother] reported it to someone.
636419013bc521fae9f7db90,7,[The mother] can't recall who [she reported it to].
636419013bc521fae9f7db90,8,That person said the trouble was owing to the neighborhood being largely Irish.
636419013bc521fae9f7db90,9,[The person said] they didn't want black people living there.
636419013bc521fae9f7db90,10,The person noted that they themselves were Irish too.
636419013bc521fae9f7db90,11,So the mother went to report it to the police.
636419013bc521fae9f7db90,12,[The mother] asked what they would do about it.
636419013bc521fae9f7db90,13,The police said there was nothing they could do.
636419013bc521fae9f7db90,14,[The police] could only advise that the family moved somewhere else.
636419013bc521fae9f7db90,15,The mother said that she can't afford to move.
636419013bc521fae9f7db90,16,[The mother] asked that police at least give them a lift home in the police car.
636419013bc521fae9f7db90,17,"Given that it was in the 1920s, the car had a bell that clanged."
636419013bc521fae9f7db90,18,[The bell] clanged like the 'clang clang' of a trolley as they went.
636419013bc521fae9f7db90,19,The noise caused a small crowd to assemble.
636419013bc521fae9f7db90,20,[The crowd] assembled when they arrived in the neighborhood.
636419013bc521fae9f7db90,21,When she got out of the car the mother asked the crowd why they were 'doing this' to them.
636419013bc521fae9f7db90,22,[The mother said] they were just like them only looked different.
636419013bc521fae9f7db90,23,At this stage I got distracted and sleepy.
636419013bc521fae9f7db90,24,[I] missed a few lines.
636419013bc521fae9f7db90,25,Towards the end the neighbors were friendly.
60475f1790672f23136c2cc4,1,This ten year old was sitting in the house with her siblings
60475f1790672f23136c2cc4,2,when stones were thrown through the window
60475f1790672f23136c2cc4,3,"and she told the kids to hide by the staircase to avoid getting hurt,"
60475f1790672f23136c2cc4,4,she then opened the door
60475f1790672f23136c2cc4,5,"ran in the streets to where her mother worked ,"
60475f1790672f23136c2cc4,6,and a policeman was close by

60475f1790672f23136c2cc4,9,her mother asked the police officer to help
60475f1790672f23136c2cc4,10,but he said he cannot help
60475f1790672f23136c2cc4,11,all he knows is they wont people like them there(black people)
60475f1790672f23136c2cc4,12,but he could not say it
60475f1790672f23136c2cc4,13,he just said to her they must move.
60475f1790672f23136c2cc4,14,"she then told him she cant move because she just moved in,"
60475f1790672f23136c2cc4,15,she then told him to take her to the police station
60475f1790672f23136c2cc4,16,where she spoke to another officer
60475f1790672f23136c2cc4,17,who told her he too could not help her
60475f1790672f23136c2cc4,18,"the only solution is for her to move,"
60475f1790672f23136c2cc4,19,she told him she already paid the months rent with all the money she has
60475f1790672f23136c2cc4,20,so she cant afford to move
60475f1790672f23136c2cc4,21,she asked him to take her home
60475f1790672f23136c2cc4,22,and he took her home in horse pulled police carriage
60475f1790672f23136c2cc4,23,it made a clang clang sound when it went to her house
60475f1790672f23136c2cc4,24,and the neighbours came rushing out to see what was going on
60475f1790672f23136c2cc4,25,then they saw this woman coming out of the carriage
60475f1790672f23136c2cc4,26,and she addressed the public
60475f1790672f23136c2cc4,27,told them she just paid rent with her last money
60475f1790672f23136c2cc4,28,and she cant afford to move
60475f1790672f23136c2cc4,29,so they should get used to having them there
60475f1790672f23136c2cc4,30,because she is not even sure if she will have money for the next rent
60475f1790672f23136c2cc4,31,add to that it is winter and her windows are broken.
60475f1790672f23136c2cc4,32,from that day the people became more neighbourly.
601f08cba1191642cadf59c1,1,A black family live together in a rented house in a Jewish or Irish neighbourhood on fourth street.
601f08cba1191642cadf59c1,2,"One day, after the father had had a drink whilst moving fur and the mother had gone out, some people started throwing stones at the house, breaking the windows."
601f08cba1191642cadf59c1,3,The daughter was inside and was very afraid and trying to look after the young children in the house and protect them.
601f08cba1191642cadf59c1,4,They ended up calling the police who didn't do anything so they went to the precinct where they explained the situation.
601f08cba1191642cadf59c1,5,These police also didn't do much so the mother asked for a lift back to the house.
601f08cba1191642cadf59c1,6,"On the way back, around 5th Street, they saw all the neighbours."
601f08cba1191642cadf59c1,7,"The mother was quite smart as she had completed school, finishing around 1925 and spoke to all the neighbours."
601f08cba1191642cadf59c1,8,"She told them that apart from their colour, they were the same as everyone else."
601f08cba1191642cadf59c1,9,"They paid their rent and didn't have any money to currently move, explaining that they would stay in the rented house for another month, as they had paid for this."
604a8a4926724aaed69b940b,1,"From what I recall from the story,"
604a8a4926724aaed69b940b,2,there was some racism for black people in an Irish neighborhood.
604a8a4926724aaed69b940b,3,The mother and the child both had to deal with tough times.
604a8a4926724aaed69b940b,4,"The mother/child received word that they could not provide for the child properly,"
604a8a4926724aaed69b940b,5,at least that was what the child was complaining about.
604a8a4926724aaed69b940b,6,I know that the mother went to a high school in 1925.
604a8a4926724aaed69b940b,7,I remember something about Younge street.
604a8a4926724aaed69b940b,8,The story was taking place in Canada I believe.
604a8a4926724aaed69b940b,9,That is all I recall words were moving fast.
604a8a4926724aaed69b940b,10,Thanks.
5ec83217e7e29110f1f1cde0,1,"A person moved house,"
5ec83217e7e29110f1f1cde0,2,their Dad was a drunk.
5ec83217e7e29110f1f1cde0,3,Their mother went out to the shop
5ec83217e7e29110f1f1cde0,4,and their father also left.
5ec83217e7e29110f1f1cde0,5,Whilst they were left alone
5ec83217e7e29110f1f1cde0,6,a stone was thrown through the window.
5ec83217e7e29110f1f1cde0,7,The person looked after their siblings
5ec83217e7e29110f1f1cde0,8,who were crying.
5ec83217e7e29110f1f1cde0,9,They went to find their mother
5ec83217e7e29110f1f1cde0,10,and eventually found her
5ec83217e7e29110f1f1cde0,11,but a police officer wondered why the person was so distressed.
5ec83217e7e29110f1f1cde0,12,The police man said he could not help
5ec83217e7e29110f1f1cde0,13,and claimed the Mum was loud
5ec83217e7e29110f1f1cde0,14,and talked for a long time.
5ec83217e7e29110f1f1cde0,15,The Mum said he was being racist
5ec83217e7e29110f1f1cde0,16,because of her skin colour.
5ec83217e7e29110f1f1cde0,17,She then asked for a lift home.
5daa828510839e0016aa193b,1,It's about a black family moving into a neighbourhood
5daa828510839e0016aa193b,2,that is hostile to those that aren't white.
5daa828510839e0016aa193b,3,"There are three kids and their parents,"
5daa828510839e0016aa193b,4,the kids are left at home while the parents are out.
5daa828510839e0016aa193b,5,"Suddenly their window is hit and broken by a rock,"
5daa828510839e0016aa193b,6,the assumed eldest of the kids takes them away from the window to hide
5daa828510839e0016aa193b,7,while the assumed eldest goes to find their mother.
5daa828510839e0016aa193b,8,Their mother goes to the police
5daa828510839e0016aa193b,9,"and tries to see what they can do,"
5daa828510839e0016aa193b,10,but all they can say is for them to leave the neighbourhood.
5daa828510839e0016aa193b,11,"So the mother takes it on herself to speak to the neighbours,"
5daa828510839e0016aa193b,12,and that's all i got.
56e6f0dec89073000de74780,1,"When the boy was about 10 years old,"
56e6f0dec89073000de74780,2,his family moved to a house on Third and Wharton.
56e6f0dec89073000de74780,3,"On the day they moved in,"
56e6f0dec89073000de74780,4,his father left to get the horses
56e6f0dec89073000de74780,5,and his mother went to get groceries at the store owned by Jewish people that opened later than usual.
56e6f0dec89073000de74780,6,He was left home minding his younger siblings
56e6f0dec89073000de74780,7,and someone threw stones through the windows.
56e6f0dec89073000de74780,8,He moved the kids under the stairs to be safe from the glass
56e6f0dec89073000de74780,9,and went to find his mother on 4th street.
56e6f0dec89073000de74780,10,A passing policeman heard him telling his mom what happened
56e6f0dec89073000de74780,11,and she asked him what he was going to do.
56e6f0dec89073000de74780,12,He said there was nothing he could do
56e6f0dec89073000de74780,13,and that they should probably move because they weren't welcome.
56e6f0dec89073000de74780,14,She asked him where his station was
56e6f0dec89073000de74780,15,and went there to see if anyone could help her.
56e6f0dec89073000de74780,16,They told her the same thing
56e6f0dec89073000de74780,17,but gave them a ride home on the police carriage when she asked.
56e6f0dec89073000de74780,18,"When she arrived,"
56e6f0dec89073000de74780,19,"she told her neighbors that had gathered because of the loud noise for the carriage bells,"
56e6f0dec89073000de74780,20,that she would be there for a month because she had paid for a month
56e6f0dec89073000de74780,21,and if they wanted her to leave then they could give her the money.
56e6f0dec89073000de74780,22,Nobody bothered them after that
56e6f0dec89073000de74780,23,and were even quite friendly when his Dad got sick.
5716a297c5aca200128d2c52,1,There is a family that just moved to a rental house on Third and Wharton.
5716a297c5aca200128d2c52,2,The story is told from the perspective of a child aged 10 and set around 1925 so there are horses and carts.
5716a297c5aca200128d2c52,3,The father was a drunk and had to go out and get the horses.
5716a297c5aca200128d2c52,4,The mother left the house and came back on that day.
5716a297c5aca200128d2c52,5,When the whole family was in the house a stone came crashing through the window and broke it.
5716a297c5aca200128d2c52,6,There were people outside throwing stones at the house.
5716a297c5aca200128d2c52,7,The narrator gathered the younger children in the stairway so they would not be harmed and the mother ran out of the house.
5716a297c5aca200128d2c52,8,The narrator followed.
5716a297c5aca200128d2c52,9,They went to fourth street because that was a Jewish neighbourhood where things were open late and there were horses and carts.
5716a297c5aca200128d2c52,10,They came across a policeman who was Irish.
5716a297c5aca200128d2c52,11,He said it is a bad neighbourhood and an Irish one.
5716a297c5aca200128d2c52,12,He said they don't want black people living there and that is why the stone was thrown at the window and told the mother they should just move.
5716a297c5aca200128d2c52,13,The mother and narrator walk to the precint on fifth street where the policeman worked.
5716a297c5aca200128d2c52,14,She spoke to another police who told her the same thing and she should move.
5716a297c5aca200128d2c52,15,She said that they do not have the money and they gave all their money for rent and the least he could do was take them home.
5716a297c5aca200128d2c52,16,The policeman took them in a police horse and cart with a large bell on it.
5716a297c5aca200128d2c52,17,So all the neighbours came out of their homes to see it.
5716a297c5aca200128d2c52,18,The mother then tells them how she has no money and will definitely be there for the month but maybe not longer if they cannot afford the next months rent.
5716a297c5aca200128d2c52,19,She tells the crowd that they can give her money to move if they don't want them there but they do not give money.
5716a297c5aca200128d2c52,20,The father becomes ill during this and the neighbours act nice and help.
5716a297c5aca200128d2c52,21,The mother said they cannot afford to fix the window and it is cold.
62ade6ed8f62ae5ea2ac12e1,1,"It’s 1925,"
62ade6ed8f62ae5ea2ac12e1,2,a black family moved into a house in an Irish neighbourhood
62ade6ed8f62ae5ea2ac12e1,3,and had stones thrown through their window
62ade6ed8f62ae5ea2ac12e1,4,so went to the police
62ade6ed8f62ae5ea2ac12e1,5,and the police told them to move
62ade6ed8f62ae5ea2ac12e1,6,but they couldn’t afford to
62ade6ed8f62ae5ea2ac12e1,7,as they had paid a months rent
62ade6ed8f62ae5ea2ac12e1,8,so had no money.
62ade6ed8f62ae5ea2ac12e1,9,"Police took the home,"
62ade6ed8f62ae5ea2ac12e1,10,"the mum shouted at the neighbours,"
62ade6ed8f62ae5ea2ac12e1,11,and then the neighbours were all nice
62ade6ed8f62ae5ea2ac12e1,12,when the dad got sick.
62ade6ed8f62ae5ea2ac12e1,13,The author was 10.
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,1,We moved to Third and Whardoff.
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,2,My father went out - did I tell you he drank?
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,3,And my mother went to the store to get some things for our home.
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,4,When my father left people began throwing stones - stones flying through the window.
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,5,"Of course, I was left at home with the children."
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,6,"So I rushed them to the stairway, because that was the only place where they wouldn't get hit by flying glass."
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,7,"Once they were there I said ""You stay here, I am going to get mom"" (We called our mother mom)."
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,8,I ran out the door and didn't know what to expect.
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,9,I ran to Fourth.
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,10,"The neighbourhood was Jewish, and so the stores stayed open until late."
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,11,"Any bit of money they could earn, they did."
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,12,When I reached my mother I couldn't make sense in what I was saying.
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,13,A passing policeman heard the commotion and wanted to find out why I was in such a state.
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,14,"Once he found out, he told my mother that the neighbourhood is Irish, and that we should move out because we're black."
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,15,"He didn't say 'black' but he said ""They don't want somebody living there""."
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,16,"My mother said to him that she had spent all of her savings on that months rent, and didn't have enough to move."
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,17,"She said ""You're civil service, you must protect us""."
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,18,He said that he couldn't do that - he was Irish too.
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,19,"My mother asked ""Where is the precinct you work""."
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,20,"He told her, but I don't remember the exact details, even though I was standing with my mother."
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,21,"We went to the precinct and spoke to the head officer, but he told my mother the same thing ""Move away""."
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,22,"She explained the situation to him, but he said he couldn't help."
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,23,"She finally said ""The least you can do is drive me home""."
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,24,So he did.
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,25,"The police car, hors and cart, mad a clanging sound."
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,26,Clang clang clang.
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,27,"As we turned the corner - the precinct wasn't far, maybe on Fifth - everyone turned and came out of their homes to hear the noise."
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,28,"The policeman sat up front, and we were let out the wide back door of the cart."
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,29,"As my mother got out she turned to face all the people and asked ""Why do you do this to me?"
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,30,"We are the same, maybe not color wise, but in every other respect, we are the same."
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,31,I have spent all of my savings on moving here.
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,32,"We are living here for a month at least, I don't have enough to move away."
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,33,I am just trying to provide a home for my family.
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,34,"I don't have enough money to fix my windows, so unless you want to get together and pay for me to move, I am staying for a month""."
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,35,"Of course they didn't pay, but during that month, my father got sick."
603659d5c391045d1e4b332b,36,The people were as sweet as can be.
5d5e66b3844f160001f24150,1,The child was left home alone except for his/her siblings
5d5e66b3844f160001f24150,2,because his mum had gone shopping
5d5e66b3844f160001f24150,3,and his father had gone to (I think) take some horses back to their stables.
5d5e66b3844f160001f24150,4,Shortly after his mother left
5d5e66b3844f160001f24150,5,there was a huge crash
5d5e66b3844f160001f24150,6,and a window in the house was smashed.
5d5e66b3844f160001f24150,7,"The child was afraid,"
5d5e66b3844f160001f24150,8,but he managed to move the younger children into the stairwell where no stones could reach.
5d5e66b3844f160001f24150,9,He ran out to look for his mother
5d5e66b3844f160001f24150,10,"who was shopping in the Jewish area,"
5d5e66b3844f160001f24150,11,where shop-keepers worked long hours to maximise their income.
5d5e66b3844f160001f24150,12,He managed to find her
5d5e66b3844f160001f24150,13,and tell her what had happened.
5d5e66b3844f160001f24150,14,She asked for directions to the police station
5d5e66b3844f160001f24150,15,"and she, and the child, went there."
5d5e66b3844f160001f24150,16,The police were sympathetic
5d5e66b3844f160001f24150,17,but unable to offer any help.
5d5e66b3844f160001f24150,18,"They didn't expressly say it,"
5d5e66b3844f160001f24150,19,but they indicated that the trouble was because the family are black
5d5e66b3844f160001f24150,20,and this is a predominantly Irish neighbourhood.
5d5e66b3844f160001f24150,21,Their only suggestion was that she move the family into a different area.
5d5e66b3844f160001f24150,22,The mother was indignant at this
5d5e66b3844f160001f24150,23,and pointed out that she could not afford to move again.
5d5e66b3844f160001f24150,24,"As the police could not offer any help,"
5d5e66b3844f160001f24150,25,"she asked them to at least take her and the child home,"
5d5e66b3844f160001f24150,26,"which they did, in a noisy, horse-drawn police vehicle."
5d5e66b3844f160001f24150,27,"The noise brought out all her neighbours,"
5d5e66b3844f160001f24150,28,which gave the mother the opportunity to address them all.
5d5e66b3844f160001f24150,29,"She told them that she could not afford to move,"
5d5e66b3844f160001f24150,30,she had paid a month's rent on the property
5d5e66b3844f160001f24150,31,and would be there for at least that time.
5d5e66b3844f160001f24150,32,"After that, who knew."
5d5e66b3844f160001f24150,33,"She was defiant and strong when she spoke to them,"
5d5e66b3844f160001f24150,34,pointed out that other than skin colour they were the same
5d5e66b3844f160001f24150,35,and that she should be allowed to live there in peace.
5a5f945176d1c60001ab7e30,1,We moved onto Third and Wharton.
5a5f945176d1c60001ab7e30,2,My father drank a lot.
5a5f945176d1c60001ab7e30,3,"When he took the team of horses, used to move us in, back, he then didn't return."
5a5f945176d1c60001ab7e30,4,My mother left the house to buy some food from the Jewish shop as they stayed open all hours.
5a5f945176d1c60001ab7e30,5,I was in charge of the children.
5a5f945176d1c60001ab7e30,6,I was ten years old.
5a5f945176d1c60001ab7e30,7,"After my mother and father left, there was an almighty crash."
5a5f945176d1c60001ab7e30,8,A stone had been thrown through the window.
5a5f945176d1c60001ab7e30,9,I told the children to hide in the stairwell so that they wouldn't be injured.
5a5f945176d1c60001ab7e30,10,The house was stoned.
5a5f945176d1c60001ab7e30,11,I ran out of the house to find my mother.
5a5f945176d1c60001ab7e30,12,"When I was telling her what happened, a policeman heard me."
5a5f945176d1c60001ab7e30,13,"He said it was a rough area and that the Irish didn't want black people there, though he didn't say black."
5a5f945176d1c60001ab7e30,14,My mother asked him what he was going to do.
5a5f945176d1c60001ab7e30,15,He said there was nothing he could do and we should move.
5a5f945176d1c60001ab7e30,16,He was Irish too.
5a5f945176d1c60001ab7e30,17,My mother said we had spent the money on rent for a month so couldn't move.
5a5f945176d1c60001ab7e30,18,She asked him where his station was.
5a5f945176d1c60001ab7e30,19,We went there to see the captain but he said the same.
5a5f945176d1c60001ab7e30,20,The captain wasn't used to a black woman standing up for herself as most were cowed by the white people.
5a5f945176d1c60001ab7e30,21,"She made him bring us home in the police patrol, which was a cart with horses."
5a5f945176d1c60001ab7e30,22,It was 1925.
5a5f945176d1c60001ab7e30,23,"At the house, she told the people waiting that she would be there for the month as she had paid the rent and that, apart from being black, she was the same as them."
5a5f945176d1c60001ab7e30,24,"Later, my father became ill."
5a5f945176d1c60001ab7e30,25,The neighbours were helpful.
64287b2deed56861af146830,1,"We arrived at 3rd & Wharton,"
64287b2deed56861af146830,2,it was olden times.
64287b2deed56861af146830,3,We were in the front room
64287b2deed56861af146830,4,"when we heard a crash,"
64287b2deed56861af146830,5,looked and there was a stone in the middle of the room.
64287b2deed56861af146830,6,They were smashing the windows.
64287b2deed56861af146830,7,Mum took us to the stairs
64287b2deed56861af146830,8,so we wouldn’t get hit by flying glass.
64287b2deed56861af146830,9,We were told it was an Irish neighbourhood
64287b2deed56861af146830,10,and they didn’t want black people there.
64287b2deed56861af146830,11,"Mum told them she had paid all the money she had to move in,"
64287b2deed56861af146830,12,so there was no way she would move out.
64287b2deed56861af146830,13,She said it was the real estate agents fault.
64287b2deed56861af146830,14,This was in 1925
64287b2deed56861af146830,15,and horse pulled police cabins.
64287b2deed56861af146830,16,We rode in one
64287b2deed56861af146830,17,and went home.
64287b2deed56861af146830,18,It was a very terrifying experience for me.
60c1d285791d2605d8d7d131,1,"In the 1920s, a boy was living with her mother and father and siblings in an irish neighborhood."
60c1d285791d2605d8d7d131,2,They were a black family who rented in an irish neighborhood for a month.
60c1d285791d2605d8d7d131,3,The boy's father went to attend the horses outside.
60c1d285791d2605d8d7d131,4,The mother went to fourth street which is a market.
60c1d285791d2605d8d7d131,5,The boy was home alone with just his younger siblings.
60c1d285791d2605d8d7d131,6,He heard a loud noise crashing through the window.
60c1d285791d2605d8d7d131,7,The loud crash was a rock that was thrown through the window.
60c1d285791d2605d8d7d131,8,The boy managed to keep his siblings protected from the window glass by standing on the staircase.
60c1d285791d2605d8d7d131,9,He was scared and ran outside to find his mom at fourth street.
60c1d285791d2605d8d7d131,10,When the boy found his mother there was surprisingly a policeman passing by.
60c1d285791d2605d8d7d131,11,He managed to explain the story of what happened to the policeman and his mother.
60c1d285791d2605d8d7d131,12,The policeman was understanding but mentioned that there was nothing he could do to help.
60c1d285791d2605d8d7d131,13,Probably due to the racial segregation existing at those times.
60c1d285791d2605d8d7d131,14,The mother was relentless and opted to go to the nearest police station to find someone to help with this matter if this policeman can't.
60c1d285791d2605d8d7d131,15,She went to the police station where they told her the same thing and suggested she moved out.
60c1d285791d2605d8d7d131,16,She mentions she can't move out because she paid the rent for the month with her last money.
60c1d285791d2605d8d7d131,17,She asked the policeman take her home in his carriage instead.
60c1d285791d2605d8d7d131,18,When she arrived she told the irish people in the neighborhood if they want her to leave they must collectively contribute enough money for her to move out because she doesn't have any money left over to move out.
60c1d285791d2605d8d7d131,19,"After her speech, the neighborhood treated her better and more neighborly after that."
5e98ce846515431026d195c6,1,We move to a new neighbourhood.
5e98ce846515431026d195c6,2,We made from a different neighbourhood as my dad was an alcoholic.
5e98ce846515431026d195c6,3,We moved in and my dad went out to drink.
5e98ce846515431026d195c6,4,My mum went out to go shopping.
5e98ce846515431026d195c6,5,I was left at home.
5e98ce846515431026d195c6,6,Then a stone came through the window and smash the window.
5e98ce846515431026d195c6,7,I was scared.
5e98ce846515431026d195c6,8,But I went outside and there were people.
5e98ce846515431026d195c6,9,I didn’t know what to do.
5e98ce846515431026d195c6,10,I had to look after the children.
5e98ce846515431026d195c6,11,The children were in the hallway.
5e98ce846515431026d195c6,12,I had to find my mum.
5e98ce846515431026d195c6,13,My mum had gone to a place a place where you can get what you want for money.
5e98ce846515431026d195c6,14,A shop.
5e98ce846515431026d195c6,15,My mum was shopping.
5e98ce846515431026d195c6,16,I found my mum and tried to tell her what had happened.
5e98ce846515431026d195c6,17,A police man had come by and tried to say what had happened.
5e98ce846515431026d195c6,18,The policeman said this is a bad neighbourhood.
5e98ce846515431026d195c6,19,People called us black but they didn’t say black back them.
5e98ce846515431026d195c6,20,My mum asked the police man to help but he said he couldn’t help.
5e98ce846515431026d195c6,21,He said we should move.
5e98ce846515431026d195c6,22,This is a bad neighbourhood.
5e98ce846515431026d195c6,23,This is an Irish neighbourhood.
5e98ce846515431026d195c6,24,my mum said you need to find who did this.
5e98ce846515431026d195c6,25,The policeman said he could not help you did not see them.
5e98ce846515431026d195c6,26,You do not know who to blame.
5e98ce846515431026d195c6,27,He told my mum that we should move.
5e98ce846515431026d195c6,28,But she said she couldn’t move.
5e98ce846515431026d195c6,29,She paid rent upfront.
5e98ce846515431026d195c6,30,This is all the money she had.
5e98ce846515431026d195c6,31,The estate agent is to blame if they didn’t want us living here they should’ve rented us the house.
5e98ce846515431026d195c6,32,My mum told the police officer to take us back in the patrol car.
5e98ce846515431026d195c6,33,We drove back home in the patrol car.
5e98ce846515431026d195c6,34,When we got back home we had to get out the back of the patrol car.
5e98ce846515431026d195c6,35,It was one of those ones that have steps to get out the back.
5e98ce846515431026d195c6,36,"As we were driving, the car goes, clang clang clang, that’s the sound of the car."
5e98ce846515431026d195c6,37,When we got back all the neighbours had come out to see what was happening.
5e98ce846515431026d195c6,38,My mum said that if you don’t want us here you can’t do anything I have rented this house.
5e98ce846515431026d195c6,39,I have spent all my money on rent.
5e98ce846515431026d195c6,40,I will be here for a month I can’t afford windows.
5e98ce846515431026d195c6,41,my mum was smart.
5e98ce846515431026d195c6,42,She went to high school.
5e98ce846515431026d195c6,43,This is 1925.
5e98ce846515431026d195c6,44,Soon after we moved in my dad got sick.
5e98ce846515431026d195c6,45,The neighbours were supportive like you would expect.
5e98ce846515431026d195c6,46,The neighbours did what you would expect neighbours to do.
5fad0a601ab00734f83bf339,1,A black family is moving into a white neighborhood.
5fad0a601ab00734f83bf339,2,Mom and Dad leave the house
5fad0a601ab00734f83bf339,3,and someone throws a stone through the window
5fad0a601ab00734f83bf339,4,while the kids are there.
5fad0a601ab00734f83bf339,5,They have enough sense to run upstairs
5fad0a601ab00734f83bf339,6,and the eldest decides to go look for their mother
5fad0a601ab00734f83bf339,7,as they know where they are.
5fad0a601ab00734f83bf339,8,The eldest finds the mother
5fad0a601ab00734f83bf339,9,and they talk to a police officer
5fad0a601ab00734f83bf339,10,"who urges them to leave,"
5fad0a601ab00734f83bf339,11,the mom refuses
5fad0a601ab00734f83bf339,12,and demands to be taken to the precinct.
5fad0a601ab00734f83bf339,13,There she talks to the officer's superior
5fad0a601ab00734f83bf339,14,"and also ends up nowhere with him,"
5fad0a601ab00734f83bf339,15,this is when she asks to be taken home with a police patrol.
5fad0a601ab00734f83bf339,16,"When they get home,"
5fad0a601ab00734f83bf339,17,the neighbors are looking outside to see them
5fad0a601ab00734f83bf339,18,and the mom gives them a piece of her mind.
5fad0a601ab00734f83bf339,19,Some of the neighbors are nice
5fad0a601ab00734f83bf339,20,and help the family
5fad0a601ab00734f83bf339,21,and the dad becomes sick.
60c0c4333e49151d768bb35b,1,The incident the narrator is telling took place in 1925 in New York City.
60c0c4333e49151d768bb35b,2,The narrator was 10 years old at the time.
60c0c4333e49151d768bb35b,3,He and his family had just rented a house and moved their furniture in.
60c0c4333e49151d768bb35b,4,It was an Irish neighbourhood and not integrated.
60c0c4333e49151d768bb35b,5,They must have been the first black family that had tried to live there.
60c0c4333e49151d768bb35b,6,The father and the mother had had to go out separately on errands.
60c0c4333e49151d768bb35b,7,This left the narrator to look after his siblings.
60c0c4333e49151d768bb35b,8,Suddenly a rock came through the front window.
60c0c4333e49151d768bb35b,9,This was followed by a shower of other stones.
60c0c4333e49151d768bb35b,10,The narrator hid his siblings on the stairs where they would be safe from flying glass.
60c0c4333e49151d768bb35b,11,He went out to find his mom.
60c0c4333e49151d768bb35b,12,His mom was shopping in the Jewish neighbourhood a little way away.
60c0c4333e49151d768bb35b,13,He was telling his mom about the attack.
60c0c4333e49151d768bb35b,14,A policeman came by and heard their conversation.
60c0c4333e49151d768bb35b,15,"The policeman, who was Irish himself, said that he couldn't do anything."
60c0c4333e49151d768bb35b,16,This was especially since the narrator didn't know who had attacked them.
60c0c4333e49151d768bb35b,17,The policeman said that the only thing they could do was move out of the neighbourhood.
60c0c4333e49151d768bb35b,18,The mother stood up to the policeman.
60c0c4333e49151d768bb35b,19,She said she could not move for lack of money.
60c0c4333e49151d768bb35b,20,They had paid a month's rent in advance.
60c0c4333e49151d768bb35b,21,Perhaps the real estate agent should not have rented them the house?
60c0c4333e49151d768bb35b,22,Then they went to the police station.
60c0c4333e49151d768bb35b,23,The other policemen were equally unhelpful.
60c0c4333e49151d768bb35b,24,They advised them to move out.
60c0c4333e49151d768bb35b,25,But the police drove them home.
60c0c4333e49151d768bb35b,26,The whole neighbourhood saw them arrive in the police wagon.
60c0c4333e49151d768bb35b,27,The mother then explained to the neighbours that she realized they were different.
60c0c4333e49151d768bb35b,28,She couldn't move because it was winter.
60c0c4333e49151d768bb35b,29,She had no money to go anywhere else.
60c0c4333e49151d768bb35b,30,"Eventually, the neighbours actually became helpful."
60c0c4333e49151d768bb35b,31,They showed the kind of solidarity neighbours should show to each other.
64e7dcdda57ceb0c4584ffe5,1,A family moved to an Irish neighbourhood on a street called Wharton.
64e7dcdda57ceb0c4584ffe5,2,"One day when the father was out tending to the horses and the mom was out shopping, someone started throwing stones through the windows."
64e7dcdda57ceb0c4584ffe5,3,The 10 year old child of the family told the other kids to hide so they wouldn't be hurt.
64e7dcdda57ceb0c4584ffe5,4,The child then ran out to fifth street to search for their mom.
64e7dcdda57ceb0c4584ffe5,5,"Upon finding the mom, the mom then talks to a police officer and asks for help."
64e7dcdda57ceb0c4584ffe5,6,"The officer, who is also Irish, says that there is nothing he can do and implies that moving out of that neighbourhood is the best course of action."
64e7dcdda57ceb0c4584ffe5,7,"Unsatisfied with this answer, the mom goes to the police station to talk to someone higher up."
64e7dcdda57ceb0c4584ffe5,8,"She is received better here, but is still told nothing can be done because she didn't see who threw the stones."
64e7dcdda57ceb0c4584ffe5,9,The officer gives the mom a ride back home in a carriage with the clanging bells.
64e7dcdda57ceb0c4584ffe5,10,The mom then addresses the neighbourhood and tells them they will be there for at least the next month and so they should be more accepting of them.
5fc423afc5dad58229f0c1c0,1,"Honestly,"
5fc423afc5dad58229f0c1c0,2,that felt like pure nonsense
5fc423afc5dad58229f0c1c0,3,and it's difficult to recall.
5fc423afc5dad58229f0c1c0,4,I remember
5fc423afc5dad58229f0c1c0,5,there were race issues.
5fc423afc5dad58229f0c1c0,6,They were staying for a month.
5fc423afc5dad58229f0c1c0,7,She didn't have any money to pay rent.
5fc423afc5dad58229f0c1c0,8,She went to the police to complain.
5fc423afc5dad58229f0c1c0,9,"She was being kicked out of her place,"
5fc423afc5dad58229f0c1c0,10,and she just wanted a place for her family.
5fc423afc5dad58229f0c1c0,11,Her son was telling the story.
5fc423afc5dad58229f0c1c0,12,There was a lot of stuttering
5fc423afc5dad58229f0c1c0,13,and repetition.
5f0d5e8b03b5db770f95690d,1,"We moved into a neighbourhood between Third and Walton,"
5f0d5e8b03b5db770f95690d,2,where mainly Irish people lived.
5f0d5e8b03b5db770f95690d,3,My father was a drunk
5f0d5e8b03b5db770f95690d,4,and used to manage the horses.
5f0d5e8b03b5db770f95690d,5,"One day when my mother had gone shopping,"
5f0d5e8b03b5db770f95690d,6,people began to throw stones at our house.
5f0d5e8b03b5db770f95690d,7,We were scared
5f0d5e8b03b5db770f95690d,8,and didn't know what to do.
5f0d5e8b03b5db770f95690d,9,I went out to look for my mom
5f0d5e8b03b5db770f95690d,10,"who I spotted near a Jewish neighbourhood,"
5f0d5e8b03b5db770f95690d,11,their shops were always open till late
5f0d5e8b03b5db770f95690d,12,because they wanted to make money.
5f0d5e8b03b5db770f95690d,13,I told her what had happened
5f0d5e8b03b5db770f95690d,14,when we spotted a policeman.
5f0d5e8b03b5db770f95690d,15,My mom told him what had happened
5f0d5e8b03b5db770f95690d,16,but he wasn't interested in helping us.
5f0d5e8b03b5db770f95690d,17,He implied that people of our colour didn't belong in an Irish neighbourhood.
5f0d5e8b03b5db770f95690d,18,My mom enquired about this his precinct
5f0d5e8b03b5db770f95690d,19,and then we made our way there.
5f0d5e8b03b5db770f95690d,20,We went through various cases
5f0d5e8b03b5db770f95690d,21,"ad they admitted that they couldn't help,"
5f0d5e8b03b5db770f95690d,22,so my mom asked them to take us back in a patrol car.
5f0d5e8b03b5db770f95690d,23,"When we returned,"
5f0d5e8b03b5db770f95690d,24,my mom spoke to the people in the neighbourhood
5f0d5e8b03b5db770f95690d,25,and asked them to either give us enough money to move out or leave as be.
5f0d5e8b03b5db770f95690d,26,"Following this incident,"
5f0d5e8b03b5db770f95690d,27,we were able to move on
5f0d5e8b03b5db770f95690d,28,and enjoy ourselves with the support of people in our neighbourhood.
64ac5569f232b08a6da326bd,1,The story is told from the perspective of a 10-year-old child.
64ac5569f232b08a6da326bd,2,"The family, a mom, dad, and 2 - 3 children (not sure if it said), had just moved into a house in a predominately Irish area."
64ac5569f232b08a6da326bd,3,"The dad went out to check on the horses,"
64ac5569f232b08a6da326bd,4,while the mom went to the store down the road (on Fifth) that was run by Jewish people and open 24 hours.
64ac5569f232b08a6da326bd,5,"When the kids were home alone, somebody(ies) threw a rock into one of their windows."
64ac5569f232b08a6da326bd,6,"At this time, the narrator explains how they put their siblings into a room or closet nearby and told them that they would be safe there."
64ac5569f232b08a6da326bd,7,The narrator then runs to the store their mom went to and starts explaining what was happening.
64ac5569f232b08a6da326bd,8,A police officer arrives and they explain to the police officer what has happened.
64ac5569f232b08a6da326bd,9,The police officer tells them that this neighborhood is Irish and that they do not like the new family living in that house because they are black.
64ac5569f232b08a6da326bd,10,"Since this was 1925, there has been A LOT of outward racial prejudice, racism, and oppression."
64ac5569f232b08a6da326bd,11,"The police officer told them to move,"
64ac5569f232b08a6da326bd,12,to which the mom had made him aware that they did not have enough money to move and that they spent all their money on the rent for this new place.
64ac5569f232b08a6da326bd,13,The mom then asked to go to the precinct where this officer works and the officer took the mom and child to the precinct.
64ac5569f232b08a6da326bd,14,"Here, the mom spoke with another officer (possibly a supervisor) about the situation and got a pretty similar response."
64ac5569f232b08a6da326bd,15,She reiterated that she had to spend all of the money paying for rent upfront.
64ac5569f232b08a6da326bd,16,She also states that they should not have rented to her if they did not want her there and that the realtor should be liable.
64ac5569f232b08a6da326bd,17,"The police officer also asked the child if they saw the face of the person who threw the rock,"
64ac5569f232b08a6da326bd,18,to which the kid did not and the police officer stated they cannot do anything without anyone to blame.
64ac5569f232b08a6da326bd,19,"With this, the mom asked the officer to give them a ride home."
64ac5569f232b08a6da326bd,20,The officer took them home in a horse and buggy with bells on it.
64ac5569f232b08a6da326bd,21,"The bells were being rung as they arrived home (making a ""clang"" sound, as described) and the neighbors were outside watching."
64ac5569f232b08a6da326bd,22,"The mom and child were let out, walking down the steps from the buggy/carriage to peering eyes."
64ac5569f232b08a6da326bd,23,"The mom then addressed people in the neighbourhood letting them know that the family will be there for the month since they have already paid, that they do not have enough money to move, and don't know if they will even have enough money for next month's rent."
64ac5569f232b08a6da326bd,24,"She then posited that if they do not want them to live there, they can raise the funds themselves to move them out."
64ac5569f232b08a6da326bd,25,"The narrator then continues to explain that nobody raised the funds themselves, speculating that they don't have the money either and that the neighbors were being as ""normal"" or ""typical"" as one can hope."
64ac5569f232b08a6da326bd,26,We also learn that the father falls ill.
6160c8f657e3c4094b01614a,1,"A family moved into a new neighbourhood,"
6160c8f657e3c4094b01614a,2,"they were a black family,"
6160c8f657e3c4094b01614a,3,different from everyone else in the area
6160c8f657e3c4094b01614a,4,which was composed of irish people.
6160c8f657e3c4094b01614a,5,As soon as they moved into the house
6160c8f657e3c4094b01614a,6,some locals threw stones through the family's windows
6160c8f657e3c4094b01614a,7,causing the younger members of the family to be scared.
6160c8f657e3c4094b01614a,8,"The mother of the family requested help from the police officer,"
6160c8f657e3c4094b01614a,9,who was also irish
6160c8f657e3c4094b01614a,10,"and he wasn't very helpful,"
6160c8f657e3c4094b01614a,11,"he seemed to share the same disdain for the family,"
6160c8f657e3c4094b01614a,12,though more veiled due to his position.
6160c8f657e3c4094b01614a,13,"The officers only solution to the familys predicament was to move away,"
6160c8f657e3c4094b01614a,14,"the mother said she couldnt possibly since she has just moved in,"
6160c8f657e3c4094b01614a,15,paid for a months rent
6160c8f657e3c4094b01614a,16,so told the officer and whoever else nearby that was listening
6160c8f657e3c4094b01614a,17,that they have no choice but to accept that they will be there for at least a month
6160c8f657e3c4094b01614a,18,"and if they want them to leave that badly they should pool together enough money so they can afford to move away,"
6160c8f657e3c4094b01614a,19,they of course didn't do this since they are likely struggling just as much as them.
6160c8f657e3c4094b01614a,20,"Relations within the community got a lot better,"
6160c8f657e3c4094b01614a,21,"when the father became ill,"
6160c8f657e3c4094b01614a,22,the community was very attentive and helpful.
614b8cd74302e5942b70bde6,1,Their father drank
614b8cd74302e5942b70bde6,2,and mother went to get food
614b8cd74302e5942b70bde6,3,but father didn't come home.
614b8cd74302e5942b70bde6,4,I was there with the kids
614b8cd74302e5942b70bde6,5,and my mother went out of the house too
614b8cd74302e5942b70bde6,6,and then a crash happened
614b8cd74302e5942b70bde6,7,and it was a big stone through our window.
614b8cd74302e5942b70bde6,8,I went to find mom
614b8cd74302e5942b70bde6,9,and I ran to fourth street in a Jewish neighborhood
614b8cd74302e5942b70bde6,10,and I found my mom
614b8cd74302e5942b70bde6,11,and then we talked to a cop
614b8cd74302e5942b70bde6,12,who said you better move out of there
614b8cd74302e5942b70bde6,13,it is a bad neighborhood
614b8cd74302e5942b70bde6,14,and that he couldn't do anything to help my mom.
614b8cd74302e5942b70bde6,15,Mom didn't have enough money to move though
614b8cd74302e5942b70bde6,16,so the cops took us home
614b8cd74302e5942b70bde6,17,and then mom said she has rented the house for a month
614b8cd74302e5942b70bde6,18,so she told the cops that the only way she will move is if they give her the money to do so.
614b8cd74302e5942b70bde6,19,Our neighbors were nice though
614b8cd74302e5942b70bde6,20,and helped us out.
5954fca53e9d73000192588f,1,The child was around 10 years old
5954fca53e9d73000192588f,2,and had recently moved in to a rented house in a new neighbourhood.
5954fca53e9d73000192588f,3,The child had been in the house with their siblings.
5954fca53e9d73000192588f,4,The child's mother had gone to the shop
5954fca53e9d73000192588f,5,and the child's father had gone to tend the horses.
5954fca53e9d73000192588f,6,While the parents were away the house was stoned.
5954fca53e9d73000192588f,7,The child tried to make their siblings safe
5954fca53e9d73000192588f,8,and then left the house to find their mother.
5954fca53e9d73000192588f,9,They found the mother at the shop
5954fca53e9d73000192588f,10,and while trying to communicate to her what had happened they were overheard by a policeman.
5954fca53e9d73000192588f,11,The mother asked the policeman for assistance
5954fca53e9d73000192588f,12,but he replied there was nothing he could do.
5954fca53e9d73000192588f,13,He suggested that the family should move to another area
5954fca53e9d73000192588f,14,(there appears to have been issues with racism in the neighbourhood).
5954fca53e9d73000192588f,15,The mother advised that moving was unaffordable
5954fca53e9d73000192588f,16,and went with the child to the police station to seek assistance.
5954fca53e9d73000192588f,17,At the police station the mother confronted another police officer
5954fca53e9d73000192588f,18,and asked for assistance.
5954fca53e9d73000192588f,19,The officer declined to investigate as no suspects had been identified.
5954fca53e9d73000192588f,20,The officer was not prepared to make any effort to investigate or find the criminals.
5954fca53e9d73000192588f,21,"The mother is described as being educated, having completed high school"
5954fca53e9d73000192588f,22,and despite experiencing prejudice and discrimination was not afraid to try and secure her basic rights.
5954fca53e9d73000192588f,23,The mother requested that she and her child were transported back to the property in the police vehicle.
5954fca53e9d73000192588f,24,The police vehicle was a horse drawn cart with a bell.
5954fca53e9d73000192588f,25,On arriving at the property the mother and child exited the police vehicle
5954fca53e9d73000192588f,26,and the mother addressed her neighbours who had gathered nearby.
5954fca53e9d73000192588f,27,She explained the she had paid a month rent
5954fca53e9d73000192588f,28,"and could not afford to move,"
5954fca53e9d73000192588f,29,nor could she afford the cost of window replacement.
5954fca53e9d73000192588f,30,She acknowledged that despite the difference in her skin colour she had much in common with others in the neighbourhood.
5954fca53e9d73000192588f,31,Speaking frankly appears to have made an impact
5954fca53e9d73000192588f,32,"as the description of how the family were treated after this shows some improvement,"
5954fca53e9d73000192588f,33,especially when the father became ill.
6318e2c61780455450fe4199,1,It was 1930 in the USA.
6318e2c61780455450fe4199,2,I'm a black child aged 10 and we'd just moved into an Irish neighbourhood.
6318e2c61780455450fe4199,3,My father had gone out and hadn't returned so we were worried.
6318e2c61780455450fe4199,4,"Suddenly, stones began hitting the windows,"
6318e2c61780455450fe4199,5,"so my mother went out to see what was happening,"
6318e2c61780455450fe4199,6,and I went with her.
6318e2c61780455450fe4199,7,We saw that people were throwing stones at our house.
6318e2c61780455450fe4199,8,"We found a police officer,"
6318e2c61780455450fe4199,9,who advised us to move out of the neighbourhood as we wouldn't be welcome.
6318e2c61780455450fe4199,10,We went to the police station to report the incident.
6318e2c61780455450fe4199,11,My mother told the office in charge that the police should protect them.
6318e2c61780455450fe4199,12,He asked if my mother had seen the face of anyone throwing stones.
6318e2c61780455450fe4199,13,"She said she hadn't,"
6318e2c61780455450fe4199,14,so the officer asked how he could punish anyone if he didn't know who to punish.
6318e2c61780455450fe4199,15,"My mother asked him to drive us home,"
6318e2c61780455450fe4199,16,so he did.
6318e2c61780455450fe4199,17,"To my admiration, my mother said to the stone-throwers that we'd just moved in to the house"
6318e2c61780455450fe4199,18,"and we didn't have enough money to pay to move out,"
6318e2c61780455450fe4199,19,so she asked the people to collectively find enough money to give us so we could move out.
6318e2c61780455450fe4199,20,"People didn't give us any money,"
6318e2c61780455450fe4199,21,but they did leave us alone.
6318e2c61780455450fe4199,22,"However, the whole experience made my father unwell."
5c3cc3bad06aa00001ebc484,1,We had just gotten moved to Third and Horton.
5c3cc3bad06aa00001ebc484,2,My mother went to get food
5c3cc3bad06aa00001ebc484,3,and my father left with the horses
5c3cc3bad06aa00001ebc484,4,to take the pack of horses back.
5c3cc3bad06aa00001ebc484,5,I was alone in the house with the kids.
5c3cc3bad06aa00001ebc484,6,Then they started throwing the stones.
5c3cc3bad06aa00001ebc484,7,"I was so scared,"
5c3cc3bad06aa00001ebc484,8,I was only 10 years old.
5c3cc3bad06aa00001ebc484,9,I got the kids out of there
5c3cc3bad06aa00001ebc484,10,and ran and ran to Fourth which was a Jewish neighbourhood.
5c3cc3bad06aa00001ebc484,11,Then I found my mother
5c3cc3bad06aa00001ebc484,12,and told her what had happened.
5c3cc3bad06aa00001ebc484,13,She told a policeman what had happened
5c3cc3bad06aa00001ebc484,14,but I was so scared that my voice shook.
5c3cc3bad06aa00001ebc484,15,"He said, ""It's an Irish neighbourhood, you'll have to move""."
5c3cc3bad06aa00001ebc484,16,"My mother, the smartest person I know,"
5c3cc3bad06aa00001ebc484,17,"she's the only person I know that completed high school,"
5c3cc3bad06aa00001ebc484,18,she went to Lackawanna high school.
5c3cc3bad06aa00001ebc484,19,"My mother said she's not moving,"
5c3cc3bad06aa00001ebc484,20,we just moved and haven't got any money to move again.
5c3cc3bad06aa00001ebc484,21,The policeman said we had to move.
5c3cc3bad06aa00001ebc484,22,He was Irish himself.
5c3cc3bad06aa00001ebc484,23,The year was around 1925
5c3cc3bad06aa00001ebc484,24,and times were what they were.
5c3cc3bad06aa00001ebc484,25,"My mother told him to drive us home in the patrol car,"
5c3cc3bad06aa00001ebc484,26,"it went clang, clang a great bell that rang, clang, clang."
5c3cc3bad06aa00001ebc484,27,A crowd of people were on the streets.
5c3cc3bad06aa00001ebc484,28,My mother got out of the police patrol around where the horses came.
5c3cc3bad06aa00001ebc484,29,She told the people that they we didn't have enough money to move
5c3cc3bad06aa00001ebc484,30,and if the people wanted her to move they had to get together and find the money for them to move.
5c3cc3bad06aa00001ebc484,31,We already paid 1 months rent
5c3cc3bad06aa00001ebc484,32,and couldn't afford to move again.
5c3cc3bad06aa00001ebc484,33,Of course that never happened
5c3cc3bad06aa00001ebc484,34,and when my father got sick the neighbours were as nice as could be.
5fb2e72ac95e4c9ab7a082da,1,The brief summary of the story is that a family moved into a new neighborhood.
5fb2e72ac95e4c9ab7a082da,2,When they arrived a stone was thrown into their window.
5fb2e72ac95e4c9ab7a082da,3,The police arrived and explained to the family that it is because they are in an Irish community.
5fb2e72ac95e4c9ab7a082da,4,"and that their kind if not welcome, they are most likely a black family."
5fb2e72ac95e4c9ab7a082da,5,The cop says there is nothing they can do and suggest that the family moves.
5fb2e72ac95e4c9ab7a082da,6,The family is in shock and can't believe that this how the police answered them.
55881a68fdf99b1c9154fe4a,1,The dad was a drunk
55881a68fdf99b1c9154fe4a,2,and was at home
55881a68fdf99b1c9154fe4a,3,and had to put the furniture in the right place.
55881a68fdf99b1c9154fe4a,4,Then the dad left
55881a68fdf99b1c9154fe4a,5,and the mum left to go to the shops
55881a68fdf99b1c9154fe4a,6,and they were left with the kids.
55881a68fdf99b1c9154fe4a,7,Then someone through stones thorough the window.
55881a68fdf99b1c9154fe4a,8,So they moved the kids to hide
55881a68fdf99b1c9154fe4a,9,so they would not get hurt.
55881a68fdf99b1c9154fe4a,10,They went through the door
55881a68fdf99b1c9154fe4a,11,but was scared as they did not know what would be thrown.
55881a68fdf99b1c9154fe4a,12,They went to look for they mom who was at fourth street.
55881a68fdf99b1c9154fe4a,13,The shops shut late as they wanted to make as much money as possible.
55881a68fdf99b1c9154fe4a,14,They found there mom
55881a68fdf99b1c9154fe4a,15,and told them what happened
55881a68fdf99b1c9154fe4a,16,it took a while to make her understand.
55881a68fdf99b1c9154fe4a,17,A policeman was passing
55881a68fdf99b1c9154fe4a,18,and the sound of their voice stopped the policeman.
55881a68fdf99b1c9154fe4a,19,They told the policeman what happened
55881a68fdf99b1c9154fe4a,20,and he said that it was a bad area
55881a68fdf99b1c9154fe4a,21,the people were Irish
55881a68fdf99b1c9154fe4a,22,and they did not like black people.
55881a68fdf99b1c9154fe4a,23,They should move.
55881a68fdf99b1c9154fe4a,24,The mum said they had just moved there
55881a68fdf99b1c9154fe4a,25,and could not afford to move.
55881a68fdf99b1c9154fe4a,26,"the Policeman said there was nothing he could do,"
55881a68fdf99b1c9154fe4a,27,and the mum said where was the precinct
55881a68fdf99b1c9154fe4a,28,so she could find someone who could help her.
55881a68fdf99b1c9154fe4a,29,"At the precinct she spoke to the captain,"
55881a68fdf99b1c9154fe4a,30,he said there was nothing he could do
55881a68fdf99b1c9154fe4a,31,and she should move.
55881a68fdf99b1c9154fe4a,32,the mum asked for a lift home
55881a68fdf99b1c9154fe4a,33,and they were taken home by horse and cart
55881a68fdf99b1c9154fe4a,34,and there was a clang noise from the cart.
55881a68fdf99b1c9154fe4a,35,Once home all the neighbours were watching
55881a68fdf99b1c9154fe4a,36,"and the mum asked them why they did what they did,"
55881a68fdf99b1c9154fe4a,37,"and that she would be here for at least a month,"
55881a68fdf99b1c9154fe4a,38,as she had no money to move.
55881a68fdf99b1c9154fe4a,39,or if they wanted her to move they needed to give her the money to move.
55881a68fdf99b1c9154fe4a,40,While they were there the dad got sick
55881a68fdf99b1c9154fe4a,41,and the neighbours were kind and helpful.
6416d1aad8b7e8743fac6df0,1,They moved to third and wantan.
6416d1aad8b7e8743fac6df0,2,Dad was a drinker
6416d1aad8b7e8743fac6df0,3,and mum went to shops on fourth street
6416d1aad8b7e8743fac6df0,4,where there were horses and carts.
6416d1aad8b7e8743fac6df0,5,During this time both parents were gone
6416d1aad8b7e8743fac6df0,6,the neighbours threw stones through the window
6416d1aad8b7e8743fac6df0,7,the narrator took their siblings to the stairwell
6416d1aad8b7e8743fac6df0,8,to keep them safe from the glass.
