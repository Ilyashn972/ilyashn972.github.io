"(8, 14)","He – stopped somewhere on – I dunno, but he – how he – why he wasn't in the house. And of course I was left there with the kids. Well no sooner did my mother get out of the house – my father went first – then – oh it was such an awful crash came through the window. And I – and I looked and it was a big stone.
