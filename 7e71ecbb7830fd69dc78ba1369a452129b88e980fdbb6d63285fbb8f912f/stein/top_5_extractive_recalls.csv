One day, while the mother of the family was out shopping, the other people in the neighborhood threw rocks at the black family's house. The oldest of the children got the other kids away from the windows, and then, after saying a prayer to himself, ran out the front door to go find his mother. He found her in the market and told her what was happening. When she tried to explain things to the police, the police said that they couldn't do anything about it as there were no witnesses who could identify the culprits. The police also added that she shouldn't have moved to an irish neighborhood in the first place. After hearing this she said they had no choice, and that they were there until the end of the month at least. After asking the police to take her and her son back to her house, she explained this again to the crowd gathered around outside. After that incident the neighbors treated them like any other family in the neighborhood, and though the father of the family got sick during their time there, there were no other incidents while they lived in that house.",1134,58.29064555744008,0.05
60c0c4333e49151d768bb35b,37.0,"The incident the narrator is telling took place in 1925 in New York City. The narrator was 10 years old at the time and he and his family had just rented a house and moved their furniture in. It was an IRish neighbourhood and not integrated. They must have been the first black family that had tried to live there. The father and the mother had had to go out separately on errands, leaving the narrator to look after his siblings. Suddenly a rock came through the front window, followed by a shower of other stones. The narrator hid his siblings on the stairs where they would be safe from flying glass and went out to find his mom, who was shopping in the Jewish neighbourhood a little way away. He was telling his mom about the attack when a policeman came by and heard their conversation. The policeman, who was Irish himself said that he couldn't do anything, especially since the narrator didn't know who had attacked them. The policeman said that the only thing they could do was move out of the neighbourhood. The mother stood up to the policeman and said she could not move for lack of money and that they had paid a month's rent in advance. Perhaps the real estate agent should not have rented them the house? Then they went to the police station, where the other policemen were equally unhelpful, advising them to move out. But the police drove them home and the whole neighbourhood saw them arrive in the police wagon. The mother then explained to the neighbours that she realized they were different but she couldn't move because it was winter and she had no money to go anywhere else. Eventually, the neighbours actually became helpful and showed the kind of solidarity neighbours should show to each other.",1720,136.82508467768,0.08

The boy told the cop what had happened the cop said there was nothing they could do about it and suggested that the boy and his mother move to another neighborhood. Since the area was Irish the boy and his mother were black. The boy's mother refused to move and requested to be taken to the precinct to speak to someone else who could help her. They got on a horse cart as this was back in the 1925s. At the precinct, she was told the same story about not being able to be assisted especially with the identity of the perpetrators not being known. After realizing that she was not getting the help she required she asked to be escorted back home by the police patrol, which had a bell that clanged. The clanging noise aroused the curiosity of the neighbors, they came out of their homes to see what was happening. She got out and addressed them, telling them that unless they were willing to make donations towards her getting her down payment for her monthly rent for the house there was no way she was going anywhere for at least a month as she couldn't afford to pay rent elsewhere. So she was stuck with them and they were stuck with her for at least a month until she could find somewhere else. That was their welcoming into the neighborhood. From then neighbors started warming up to them and would step in to help whenever something happened even the boy's father got ill.",1796,105.93745813804003,0.06
