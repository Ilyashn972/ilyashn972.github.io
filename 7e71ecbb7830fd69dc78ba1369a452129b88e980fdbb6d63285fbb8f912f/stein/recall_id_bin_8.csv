There was a large crash and the kids were screaming, I ushered them under the stairs while I looked to see what it was. A stone had been thrown through the window. I ran out of the house to find my mother, I was so scared, I ran and ran and found her on forth street, I was speaking so low that a passing policeman stopped to see what had happened. My mother asked what he was going to do about it, he said nothing, my mother asked why not as I paid rent for that property and I have no more money. She asked who could help, he said no one can. My mother asked for the precinct to get them to help. My mother was an educated black woman who qualified from high school in 1925. We went to the precinct and they said they cannot help so my mother said you can take us home, they did so in the wagon that was pulled by horses with a bell that went clang. When we stopped there was a step that was put to the back so we could get out and all the neighbours had come out to see what happened. My mother told them that she had paid rent for a month and had no more money so she was going to stay for the month and if they didn't want us stay then they could pay our rent for us to leave. After that my father got sick and our neighbours helped us."

The narrator was 10 years old at the time. He and his family had just rented a house and moved their furniture in. It was an Irish neighbourhood and not integrated. They must have been the first black family that had tried to live there. The father and the mother had had to go out separately on errands. This left the narrator to look after his siblings. Suddenly a rock came through the front window. This was followed by a shower of other stones. The narrator hid his siblings on the stairs where they would be safe from flying glass. He went out to find his mom. His mom was shopping in the Jewish neighbourhood a little way away. He was telling his mom about the attack. A policeman came by and heard their conversation. The policeman, who was Irish himself, said that he couldn't do anything. This was especially since the narrator didn't know who had attacked them. The policeman said that the only thing they could do was move out of the neighbourhood. The mother stood up to the policeman. She said she could not move for lack of money. They had paid a month's rent in advance. Perhaps the real estate agent should not have rented them the house? Then they went to the police station. The other policemen were equally unhelpful. They advised them to move out. But the police drove them home. The whole neighbourhood saw them arrive in the police wagon. The mother then explained to the neighbours that she realized they were different. She couldn't move because it was winter. She had no money to go anywhere else. Eventually, the neighbours actually became helpful. The incident the narrator is telling took place in 1925 in New York City."

The child had been in the house with their siblings. The child's mother had gone to the shop and the child's father had gone to tend the horses. While the parents were away the house was stoned. The child tried to make their siblings safe and then left the house to find their mother. They found the mother at the shop and while trying to communicate to her what had happened they were overheard by a policeman. The mother asked the policeman for assistance but he replied there was nothing he could do. He suggested that the family should move to another area (there appears to have been issues with racism in the neighbourhood). The mother advised that moving was unaffordable and went with the child to the police station to seek assistance. At the police station the mother confronted another police officer and asked for assistance. The officer declined to investigate as no suspects had been identified. The officer was not prepared to make any effort to investigate or find the criminals. The mother is described as being educated, having completed high school and despite experiencing prejudice and discrimination was not afraid to try and secure her basic rights. The mother requested that she and her child were transported back to the property in the police vehicle. The police vehicle was a horse drawn cart with a bell. On arriving at the property the mother and child exited the police vehicle and the mother addressed her neighbours who had gathered nearby. She explained the she had paid a month rent and could not afford to move, nor could she afford the cost of window replacement. She acknowledged that despite the difference in her skin colour she had much in common with others in the neighbourhood. Speaking frankly appears to have made an impact as the description of how the family were treated after this shows some improvement, especially when the father became ill."

My father drank a lot. When he took the team of horses, used to move us in, back, he then didn't return. My mother left the house to buy some food from the Jewish shop as they stayed open all hours. I was in charge of the children. I was ten years old. After my mother and father left, there was an almighty crash. A stone had been thrown through the window. I told the children to hide in the stairwell so that they wouldn't be injured. The house was stoned. I ran out of the house to find my mother. When I was telling her what happened, a policeman heard me. He said it was a rough area and that the Irish didn't want black people there, though he didn't say black. My mother asked him what he was going to do. He said there was nothing he could do and we should move. He was Irish too. My mother said we had spent the money on rent for a month so couldn't move. She asked him where his station was. We went there to see the captain but he said the same. The captain wasn't used to a black woman standing up for herself as most were cowed by the white people. She made him bring us home in the police patrol, which was a cart with horses. It was 1925. At the house, she told the people waiting that she would be there for the month as she had paid the rent and that, apart from being black, she was the same as them. Later, my father became ill. The neighbours were helpful."

The narrator who is only 10 years old, takes their younger siblings into the stairwell to protect them from flying glass. They are all very scared by the experience and the narrator has to go and find their mom, which is what they call their mother. The narrator knows to go to 4th Street where there is a Jewish shop that is open late. (The narrator comments that they want to make as much money as they can so open all hours) The narrator finds mom and tells her what has happened. At the same time a policeman hears the story as the narrator is talking loudly and asks what has happened. The policeman is told and is asked what he is going to do. He replies that they will not be welcome in an Irish neighbourhood and he can do nothing about it, it is said he is Irish himself. Mom asks his precinct and goes there to complain and see what the captain will do about the incident, to which the Captain explains that if the narrator did not see who threw the stones they cannot know who is to blame. The mom then asks to be taken home in the patrol wagon and the Captain agrees. The narrator comments that her mom is educated and the only person they knew at the time with a high school diploma. The narrator mentioned that it was 1925 but I am not sure if that was the date of the incident or when mom graduated high school. the whole neighbourhood come out to the sound of the patrols clanging bell and mom tells everyone that although they are a different skin colour, she and her family are the same in every other way and she only wants to take care of her family just like they do. She has paid all the money she has upfront to live in the house and If they don't want the family there they can give her the money and she will happily move, of course no one offers and the narrator comments that no one would have that sort of money in any case. The narrator tells us that the neighbours were always kind and considerate to them and when her father got sick they were helpful and kind."
