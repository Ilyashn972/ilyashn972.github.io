She told the people that they we didn't have enough money to move and if the people wanted her to move they had to get together and find the money for them to move. We already paid 1 months rent and couldn't afford to move again. Of course that never happened and when my father got sick the neighbours were as nice as could be."

They were black. They had troubles with the people in the neighborhood who were throwing rocks at their windows. The child who was left at home was scared. He tried to call his mother. But she did not answer. He waited until he thought it was safe. Then he came out of his hiding spot. His mother got home. He told her everything that happened. They then called the police. The police told them that they could do nothing about it. They told them because they are black and this is an Irish neighborhood, they should just move out because the circumstances won't change. The mother was very smart from a very well known high school. She told the policeman that she will not move because she does not have enough money. The police insisted on them moving. She spent the whole time telling them that they don't have any money. The police then offered to take them home because they were tired of her speaking. She was the first person who actually spoke out on the situation. As they were going out, there were people surrounding them telling them that they had to move out. The mother said that in order for them to move out all of them had to come up with enough money for a month's rent. They had to pay for that house in advance. She does not have the money to move anywhere else. The story ends with the mother, saying that she will stay where she is. They have to accept that she is there. Because even if she is black, she is no different to them."
