The narrator knows to go to 4th Street where there is a Jewish shop that is open late. (The narrator comments that they want to make as much money as they can so open all hours) The narrator finds mom and tells her what has happened. At the same time a policeman hears the story as the narrator is talking loudly and asks what has happened. The policeman is told and is asked what he is going to do. He replies that they will not be welcome in an Irish neighbourhood and he can do nothing about it, it is said he is Irish himself. Mom asks his precinct and goes there to complain and see what the captain will do about the incident, to which the Captain explains that if the narrator did not see who threw the stones they cannot know who is to blame. The mom then asks to be taken home in the patrol wagon and the Captain agrees. The narrator comments that her mom is educated and the only person they knew at the time with a high school diploma. The narrator mentioned that it was 1925 but I am not sure if that was the date of the incident or when mom graduated high school. the whole neighbourhood come out to the sound of the patrols clanging bell and mom tells everyone that although they are a different skin colour, she and her family are the same in every other way and she only wants to take care of her family just like they do. She has paid all the money she has upfront to live in the house and If they don't want the family there they can give her the money and she will happily move, of course no one offers and the narrator comments that no one would have that sort of money in any case.

I'm going to try to find mom."" (We called our mother ""Mom"".) I was only 10 years old at the time. I was so scared walking towards the front door, I didn't know what I would see. There were shops nearby, in the Jewish neighbourhood. They were open all hours because they tried to take what money they could get. That's where my mother was. There were carts on the street. I ran up to my mother and started telling her what happened. A police officer went past. I was so scared I could hardly be understood. The police officer stopped, he wanted to find out what had happened and what was wrong with me. He started speaking to my mother. ""You're in a bad neighbourhood. There's nothing anyone can do for you, the people there are Irish."" He was Irish himself. ""They don't want black people living there."" But he didn't say black. ""They don't want anyone in that house, you should move."" ""We can't move."" My mother said. ""We don't have any money. If you can't do anything then tell me where your precinct is."" We went to the police station where the officer worked. We spoke to another police officer there. ""You should move."" he said. A lot of black people were cowed and put down, so they rarely spoke up for themselves, thankfully my mother was not like that. ""We cannot afford to move, surely the estate agency should be held accountable if no one wants someone living in that house. Now if you're not willing to help, I'll tell you what to do."" ""What?"" asked the officer. ""Drive me home."" Said my mother. We were driven home by the police in a cart pulled by horses. There were bells on the cart that would clang. Clang, clang, clang. Everyone came out of their houses to see what the noise was over. My mother stood up and spoke to everyone. She told them that we had no money, we had paid rent for a month (we had to pay in advance), we didn't know what would happen in a month but we couldn't leave before then.

So they went to the station on 5th and explained the situation, how they had the windows stoned, how it would make their place unbearable in the cold of winter as they had no money to fix it. The police at the station also said there was nothing they could do but did offer her a ride back in the police wagon, a wagon still driven by horses even though it was 1925. They were thankful she accepted as she talked long and hard. Clang, Clang clang went the bells as they went down the street which caused all the neighbours to come onto the street upon the wagon's arrival to see what the fuss was about. The mother took the opportunity to explain to those gathered that she had used all the family money to pay a full months rent so she was staying the month, in these cold winter days she was, colour aside, just like them in that she wanted to put a roof over her children's head and if the locals didn't want them there because they were black then they'd have to provide the money for them to move on. Naturally, this didn't happen, as likely the locals were in the same financial predicament.

Once he found out, he told my mother that the neighbourhood is Irish, and that we should move out because we're black. He didn't say 'black' but he said ""They don't want somebody living there"".

We are living here for a month at least, I don't have enough to move away. I am just trying to provide a home for my family.

The mother of the family requested help from the police officer, who was also irish and he wasn't very helpful, he seemed to share the same disdain for the family, though more veiled due to his position. The officers only solution to the familys predicament was to move away, the mother said she couldnt possibly since she has just moved in, paid for a months rent so told the officer and whoever else nearby that was listening that they have no choice but to accept that they will be there for at least a month and if they want them to leave that badly they should pool together enough money so they can afford to move away, they of course didn't do this since they are likely struggling just as much as them.

She was angry and aggrieved at the unfairness of it. They were black but they paid their rent like everyone else. If they didn't want them there why had they allowed them to rent. There was a policeman passing and the mother stopped him asking for him to come and help find who had done this. Although he was sympathetic to a degree he said the only thing he could suggest was that they moved somewhere else. The mother said she had paid the rent for a month and there was no way she would move. Her job as a mother was to protect her children. The child was proud of his mother who was educated and strong. As the policeman would not help she asked to be taken to someone more senior who could help. Again the answer was that all that they could suggest was that she move. She and the child were taken in the horse drawn police wagon back home. The clanging of the bell alerted the neighbourhood who came out to watch what was happening. The mother alighted and spoke to them saying that apart from the colour of their skin they were all the same. She had paid rent for a month and she was staying for a month.
