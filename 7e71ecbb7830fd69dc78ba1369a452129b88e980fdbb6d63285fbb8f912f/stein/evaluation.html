<p>This black family moved from a Jewish to an Irish neighbourhood. When they arrived someone stoned their windows. As the father was drunk, the narrator ran to find the Mum who they thought would know how to resolve the situation given her schooling at Lackanawny. The &#x27;Mom&#x27; sought and found a policeman on the street. He said he would like to help but there was nothing he could do even though, or in spite of, he was Irish too. So they went to the station on 5th and explained the situation, how they had the windows stoned, how it would make their place unbearable in the cold of winter as they had no money to fix it; the police at the station also said there was nothing they could do but did offer her a ride back in the police wagon, a wagon still driven by horses even though it was 1925. They were thankful she accepted as she talked long and hard. Clang, Clang clang went the bells as they went down the street which caused all the neighbours to come onto the street upon the wagon&#x27;s arrival to see what the fuss was about. The mother took the opportunity to explain to those gathered that she had used all the family money to pay a full months rent so she was staying the month, in these cold winter days she was, colour aside, just like them in that she wanted to put a roof over her children&#x27;s head and if the locals didn&#x27;t want them there because they were black then they&#x27;d have to provide the money for them to move on. Naturally, this didn&#x27;t happen, as likely the locals were in the same financial predicament however after this episode they became much friendlier, helping out wherever possible in times of need such as when the drunken father became ill.</p>

<p>A family moved into a house in a new neighbourhood. After they had moved in, the father took the horses away and the mother went shopping. While the narrator was at home with the other children, their house was attacked and stones were thrown through the window.  Once the narrator had hidden the children he went to find his mother at the Jewish shop, which stayed open late and served anyone. Once the shopkeeper had heard what had happened he told yhe mother that they lived in a bad neighbourhood and should leave. The mother said she couldn&#x27;t leave because she had used all her money for the first month&#x27;s rent. The mother went to the police to complain and they also told her to leave. It was an Irish neighbourhood in the 1920s and, because they were black, they would never fit in. The mother insisted the police drive her home. When she got home, she addressed the neighbours - explaining that she had no money to move and they were stuck with her for the month and better get used to the idea. After that the neighbours were much friendlier and even helped when the father got sick</p>

<p>The story was about a family that just moved into a neighborhood. They were black and they had troubles with the people in the neighborhood who were throwing rocks at their windows. The child who was left at home was scared and tried to call his mother. But she did not answer, he waited until he thought it was safe and then came out of his hiding spot. His mother got home and he told her everything that happened. They then called the police, and the police told them that they could do nothing about it. They told them because they are black and this is an Irish neighborhood, they should just move out because the circumstances won&#x27;t change. The mother was very smart from a very well known high school and told the policeman that she will not move because she does not have enough money. The police insisted on them moving. And she spent the whole time telling them that they don&#x27;t have any money. The police then offered to take them home because they were tired of her speaking, as she was the first person who actually spoke out on the situation. As they were going out, there were people surrounding them telling them that they had to move out. And they mother said that in order for them to move out all of them had to come up with enough money for a month&#x27;s rent as they had to pay for that house in advance and she does not have the money to move anywhere else. The story ends with the mother, saying that she will stay where she is and they have to accept that she is there because even if she is black, she is no different to them.</p>

<p>The family had recently moved house. The father wasn’t there and the mother had gone to the store when a window in the house was smashed by people in the neighbourhood. Even though the narrator was scared at what they would find outside, they left the house and tracked down the mother at the store. A policeman heard them tell what had happened and said it’s a neighbourhood of Irish people and they don’t want you there because you are black - he didn’t actually say the word black. This was in 1925 and the narrator was 10. The mother asked which precinct he worked from and they went there. She spoke to someone there who told her she was best to pack up and leave, which she couldn’t afford to do. She made them give a lift home with the police patrol and when they arrived she spoke to the crowd. She said you don’t want me here but I am paid for a month. If you want us out then you need to give us the money to go. Of course the neighbours didn’t. The mother was educated and had been to Lackawanna high school. Later then the dad was ill, the neighbours rallied round.</p>

<p>This is a story of a family that moved to a new neighbourhood and a ten year old is telling us how they were welcomed by a flock of people who threw stones in their house and broke windows. The ten year old was home alone with their young siblings whilst the mom was out to to some late night shopping in the jewish sho[s that opened until very late. The ten year old was faced with a challenge of calming their siblings down and ask them to hide ina place where they would not be hit by the stones. The ten year old later ran out to look for the mom, being careful not to be hit by the stones. They finally found the mom in the jewish stores and let her know what was happening. Whilst the ten year old was trying to tell their mom, they coul not breath or even utter the words properly because due to being frightened. There were police patrollers around who kind od understood what the ten year old was trying to say and they warned the mom about the are. The advised her to move to another area, as that area was not &quot;good for them&quot;, and according to them people like them(blacks) were not welcomed in the area. The mother told the patol that there&#x27;s no way that they can move because they had just moved in and paid rent, ad the people took their money. The mom insisted that the police help them and they told her that there&#x27;s nothing they can do. She went to the station with them and asked them to take them hoe, which they did. Eventually the family felt accepted in the neghbourhood when their father fell ill, the neighbours came by to visit them and sent well wishes. This all happened withi the Irish community during arounf 1925.</p>

<p>The day that she moved into Third and Wharton, when she was 10, her father left to return the team of horses and her mother went to do shopping on Fourth.  Some people began to throw stones through the windows of the house they had rented.  She took the other children into the stairway and told them to stay there because they would be safe from flyin&#x27; glass.  She left the house, and prayed, not knowing if they would throw things at them.  She found her mother shopping and explained what had happened.  A police officer came over and asked.  He said that the neighbourhood was bad and they were likely Irish.  He was also Irish.  He said he couldn&#x27;t do anything. Her mother asked what precinct he was from and he told her, although the narrator didn&#x27;t remember.  Likely on Fifth.  The captain was told the story and also said he couldn&#x27;t do anything because the girl didn&#x27;t see who threw the stones, and it was likely a number of people. Both the original police officer and captain suggested the family move out, because black people were not welcome there.  But her mother refused, as they didn&#x27;t have any more money, having rented the home for one month with all their money.  She told the Captain to take them home in the Police Patrol, which had a clanging bell and was pulled by horses.  As they got home a crowd had gathered.  Her mother came out the long door in the back and confronted the crowd, saying that despite being a different colour she was the same as them and was staying at least a month, couldn&#x27;t afford new windows, and if they wanted her to leave they had to give her enough money to go live somewhere else.  The crowd did not do so.  While they lived there, her father got sick, and the neighbours were very helpful and friendly.  But her welcome to the neighbourhood had been terrifying.</p>

My mother said we should go to the police station to find someone who could help us but the officer in charge said he could not help us as well.so my mother asked the police officer to take us home with their cart which had a bell which goes clang clang clang. So when we approached our area everyone rushed outside to see when the door was opened for us a lot of people where standing outside and my mother addressed them.

In the meantime some people came and smashed the windows of the house with rocks but luckily none of us got hurt but after that I went to find my mama, she was near by.

The parents were away from the house at the time and so the youngster left the house to find them.
The mother was shopping at the time and she asked for help from the police who were less than helpful, told her that as she was a Black family they were not welcome in what was an Irish area and told her to move.
She explained that she had just moved in and had done so using a real estate agent who had been happy to take her money and she now had no money with which to move.
She then insisted that they be taken home by the police patrol.
Upon arriving at the house they were greeted by the neighbours who she assumed had thrown the brick. 
She addressed them and explained that she could not afford to repair the windows and that winter was coming and requested a stop to this.
She told them that she had paid for a month and after that she wasn&#x27;t sure of their plans unless they were going to pay to have her leave she was staying, so that was that!

<p>We were at third and wharton and father had gone out and mother had gone to the market to buy some food. I was in the house with the children and people started throwing rocks through the window and there was a big crash. I realised what was happening and put the children under the stairs to shelter there. Mother had gone to fourth street to buy food at the market. It was a jewish market and they were open all hours to make as much money as they could. I decided to go find her at the market, I didn&#x27;t know what was going to happen when I got outside so I said a prayer and then ran all the way there. When I got there I found her and I was trying to tell her what happened but I was so upset my voice was such that she couldn&#x27;t understand. While I was there a policeman walked by and stopped to see what was happening and we told him. Mother said what are you going to do about it and he said the only thing to do is to move. She said I&#x27;m not going to move because I only just moved there. He said it&#x27;s an Irish neighbourhood and they dont want any black people there. Well he didn&#x27;t say black, he just said they don&#x27;t want anybody there. She asked him what precinct he is from to find someone else who would help us and he told us but I can&#x27;t remember where it was. We went there and spoke to the captain and said what are you going to do about it and he said nothing and said you have to move, same as the other policeman. Mother said well I know one thing you can do and that is to take us home. The policeman took us back to the house from about 5th street and when we got there he got out and helped mother down from the door. All the people were there standing outside and she said to them you all know whats happened and I don&#x27;t know who did it but I do know I&#x27;m not going to move. I just moved in here and spent all my money to rent this house for a month and don&#x27;t have any more money. You might as well make up your minds that I will be here for this month and if you want me to move then you all can put your money together for me. It is winter and cold and I don&#x27;t have any money to be buying windows. I don&#x27;t even know if I will have enough money to stay here for another month. After that the neighbours we very friendly and my dad got sick while we were living there and everyone wanted to help us and was kind. That was my introduction to the neighbourhood and it was terrifying.</p>

<h2>Recall 60fe26abdb9284fdf954f6df</h2>
<p>We moved in to Third and Warton and not long after my dad got drunk and went out back to try and take the horses out. My mother had gone to the store to get some groceries on Fourth, not long after my mom, we call mother mom had gone to the store and my father had gone out - there was stones being thrown at our house, I quickly moved my siblings to hide under the stairwell, I told them &quot;Do not move because you will be safe here and no stone will hit you&quot;. I was very frightened but prepared myself to go look for my mother, but was not sure what would happen immediately I stepped through the door and ran to Fourth as that&#x27;s where the carts where being pushed, I looked for my mom and found her and while trying to explain what had happened, a police officer happened to pass by, so after I composed myself a bit, I explained to him what had happened and all he could say to my mother and I was &quot;You have to move&quot; the town is Irish, my mom being angry and asked how he could say something like that and explained we had only moved here recently and she doesn&#x27;t have money to move again. The officer said he could not do anything as it sort of a norm here as we are black, he didn&#x27;t say black because they didn&#x27;t say that then but that&#x27;s basically what he meant, the officer was Irish as well. My mom angrily asked for his station and to speak to the captain. We went over to the police station which wasn&#x27;t too far from where we were, it was on Fifth. We entered and demanded to speak to the captain, we explained the situation and he basically said the same thing as the police officer. I was surprised and impressed by my mom, she stood her ground as she was more educated having gone to school in nineteen twenty-five. She explained to the captain that we have only moved here and have no money to go someplace else, and he said there was not much he could do as there was no one to blame, he also asked me if it was possible that there have been multiple people, which would make it harder to but the blame on someone. My mother suggested arresting the real estate agents as they sold the property to her despite knowing the situation in the town. My mother then said the least they could do was to drop off home and since the captain was tired of us being there because the conversation was long and loud he agreed. We went into the station patrol vehicle that had a bell attached to it and made a  &quot;Clang clang clang&quot; sound as we moved, during the journey, due to the bell a number of people came out of their homes to watch what was going on. When we reached our house, my mom turned to address the people watching, she said we had just moved here and paid money for rent for the month and that we were going to stay for the month and that after that she didn&#x27;t know, she also told them apart from the colour of their skin they were all the same people and that they should get used to us being here. She also suggested that if they all really wanted us to leave they should donate money for the family to move somewhere else, which they didn&#x27;t because they probably didn&#x27;t have any money either. After that day, everyone seemed to be nicer and even when my dad was sick they helped and offered whatever they had just like anyone else would. It was all good but my first initially welcome to that area was terrible!</p>

The family were all afraid and so they fled. they asked for help in a Jewish neighbourhood and then were directed to a police station. The police were unhelpful initially and told the family the solution was to move. the mother explained that due to financial reasons this was impossible. She insisted that the police take them home and so they w=rode in the back of the police wagon with the bell clanging. They arrived home and climbed down the back steps of the wagon to be met by several neighbours watching. The mother gave an impassioned speech about how, despite their colour they were just the same as everyone else.

<p>It happened in 1925. The narrator was 10. The father was day drinking and out of the house, after he&#x27;d moved their furniture into the house. The mother was out shopping. A rock crashed through the windows of the house. The children hid in the hallway to avoid the glass. The oldest of the children ran out of the house to Fourth Street, where the mother was. There, they found a policeman. He told them that this was a bad neighbourhood, and that they should move. He was Irish. The mother told him that they didn&#x27;t have any money to move, and they had just moved into the house. He said there was nothing he could do. She was a smart black woman, the only one in her family to have finished high school. She asked where the nearest police station was, so that she could ask someone who would be able to do something. At the station, she got the same answer: that there was nothing to be done, except move. She then told them there was one thing they could do: to drive them home in the patrol car. They did. The car made such a clanging noise that all of their neighbours came out of their houses to see what was happening. When she got out of the police car, the mother announced to the neighbours that she knows she looks different due to having different skin colour, but that they could only afford to stay in the house a month. Perhaps they would get enough money to afford to stay another month, but in the meantime, the neighbours only had to put up with them for a month. She didn&#x27;t know who threw the rock, she told them, but it was winter and it was cold, and she couldn&#x27;t afford new windows. She said that she had no money to move right away, but if they wanted, the neighbours could give her the money to move. They didn&#x27;t do that, but afterwards, when the father got sick, they were kind and courteous to the family.</p>

The mother was upset after paying a month&#x27;s rent, knowing she and her family would have to stay so she told the police to escort her home so the neighbours would all come out to see her with the police (there was a loud bell attached to the police wagon so all neighbours heard it and came outside to watch) When the neighbors were outside the Mom announced that she had no money to move so the neighbours could give her money to move or put up with them.

<p>The story is about a ten year old child in a Black family in 1925. One day they come home, and after their parents go out (their father to fetch some horses, their mother to shop at the local Jewish market which stays open late), someone throws a stone through the window of their home, smashing the glass and scaring the child and their siblings. They go to find their mother, and encounter a policeman. The child and their mother complain to the policeman about what happens; the policeman blames the Irish neighbourhood, being Irish himself, and attributes it to them not wanting Black neighbours. He says he can&#x27;t do anything about it, so the mother insists on attending his precinct, and speaking to his captain. The captain also claims not to be able to help, so the mother asks him to drive them home in the patrol vehicle. They&#x27;re dropped off near their home, the noise of the vehicle draws out their neighbours, and she addresses them all, telling them that if they don&#x27;t want her and her family there, they should pay for them to move house, as she can&#x27;t afford it, and will be there for at least a month. Thereafter, the neighbours are kind to them, especially when the child&#x27;s father is sick, but the child holds onto the memory of that frightening welcome to the neighbourhood.</p>

<h2>Recall 5c6088630112a60001a2b1e7</h2>
<p>A man is recalling a time when, as a ten year old, having just moved to a new rental unit in an Irish neighborhood. He&#x27;s alone and his mom is at the market and stones start to fly through the windows. He hides his siblings under the stairs and runs out to the market to find his mother. She approaches a police officer who tells her that black people aren&#x27;t welcome in Irish neighborhoods, and that there&#x27;s nothing he can do. She tells him that she will go to the precinct and find someone who can help. The man recalls her mother as being unusual among black people of the time in that she was not afraid to confront authority or people in uniforms. When she talks to the police chief at the precinct he repeats the same advice- to move and that he can&#x27;t help her as she hasn&#x27;t identified the suspect. She tells him all her money has gone to rent and she can&#x27;t afford to move. She asks for a ride home, and the officer agrees. She confronts her neighbors, tells them she&#x27;s paid for a month and can&#x27;t afford to move anywhere else, and that she will not be moving, and can&#x27;t afford new windows. She reminds the neighborhood that she&#x27;s fundamentally the same as them despite her difference in color- that she&#x27;s trying to look after her family and make ends meet.</p>

I found my mom and told her what had happened. She found a policeman, who was Irish, and said that the Irish were dangerous and he couldnt do anything. My mom asked him to take her to the police station where they still had wagons pulled by horses. She found the commissioner who asked her if I&#x27;d seen who dunnit. I hadn&#x27;t and he said there was nothing he could do. They don&#x27;t like black people round here. My mom was strong and didn&#x27;t accept that. She told the commissioner to take her home in the police wagon.When they got back to fourth street she stood on the steps of the wagon and said &#x27;Look here I&#x27;ve paid my rent for a month, its all we have and we are not moving.

<p>They moved to Third and Walden. I was around ten at the time and it was 1925. My father went out of the house and my mom had left to go to the market to do some shopping. 
Stones were thrown at our windows and smashed all the glass. I moved the kids to the stairway to keep them safe and they were crying and very scared.
I left the house and found my mom at the market. She told a police officer what had happened and they told her that the Irish do not like black people, although he did not specifically use the word black. The police man told her that they could not do anything and she should move. The police man was also Irish. My mom said that it is their job to protect them.
My mom went to the police station and they also said that they cannot do anything and they should move. My mom said that we cannot afford to move and if they were not going to do anything they should at least take them home in the police patrol wagon. The wagon was pulled by horses and clanged.
The police took me and mom home and the neighbours watched us return home with the wagon clanging down the road. My mom told the neighbours that she does not know why they have smashed her windows as even though she is black so different in colour she is otherwise just the same as them. She also said that they do not have the money to move. The rent is paid in advance and she had paid for the month, so she does not know if she can afford next month, but she will be there for at least a month, so if they want her to move then they should pay for her to move.
Later on my father then got sick and the neighbours treat us the same and helped as they would with any other neighbour.</p>

<h2>Recall 5dcc6f91e5e18690a20e74d1</h2>
<p>The narrator and her family are black and they move into an Irish neighbourhood.  They dont know this at the time.
One night when the narrators father, who drinks, is out tending the horses and their mother has gone to the shop the house has stones thrown at the windows and the window breaks.
The narrator who is only 10 years old, takes their younger siblings into the stairwell to protect them from flying glass.  They are all very scared by the experience and the narrator has to go and find their mom, which is what they call their mother.
The narrator knows to go to 4th Street where there is a Jewish shop that is open late. (The narrator comments that they want to make as much money as they can so open all hours)
The narrator finds mom and tells her what has happened.  At the same time a policeman hears the story as the narrator is talking loudly and asks what has happened.
The policeman is told and is asked what he is going to do.  He replies that they will not be welcome in an Irish neighbourhood and he can do nothing about it, it is said he is Irish himself.
Mom asks his precinct and goes there to complain and see what the captain will do about the incident, to which the Captain explains that if the narrator did not see who threw the stones they cannot know who is to blame.
The mom then asks to be taken home in the patrol wagon and the Captain agrees.  The narrator comments that her mom is educated and the only person they knew at the time with a high school diploma.  
The narrator mentioned that it was 1925 but I am not sure if that was the date of the incident or when mom graduated high school.
the whole neighbourhood come out to the sound of the patrols clanging bell and mom tells everyone that although they are a different skin colour, she and her family are the same in every other way and she only wants to take care of her family just like they do. She has paid all the money she has upfront to live in the house and If they don&#x27;t want the family there they can give her the money and she will happily move, of course no one offers and the narrator comments that no one would have that sort of money in any case.
The narrator tells us that the neighbours were always kind and considerate to them and when her father got sick they were helpful and kind.</p>

When the narrator found their mother and told her what happened a police man came across them. He said it was a bad area for them to be in but that he could not help them. So they went to the police station to see who could help. The captain said the same, that he could not help and so the mother asked him to bring them home in the police patrol. When they got home a crowd gathered and the mother said she had no money left to move anywhere else, she had paid for a month and if the people did not want her there they would have to give her money so she could move somewhere else. After that they had no more trouble, the neighbours were very good to them when the father was sick.</p>

<p>We moved to Third and Wharton. I told you my father used to drink, so he went out. My mother went out to buy some food, leaving me alone with the kids. Just after she had left I heard a loud crash. I saw stones coming through the window. I grabbed the kids and hid in the stairs. I told them &quot;Stay here, nothing can reach you here. I&#x27;m going to try to find mom.&quot; (We called our mother &quot;Mom&quot;.) I was only 10 years old at the time. I was so scared walking towards the front door, I didn&#x27;t know what I would see. There were shops nearby, in the Jewish neighbourhood. They were open all hours because they tried to take what money they could get. That&#x27;s where my mother was. There were carts on the street. I ran up to my mother and started telling her what happened. A police officer went past. I was so scared I could hardly be understood. The police officer stopped, he wanted to find out what had happened and what was wrong with me. He started speaking to my mother. &quot;You&#x27;re in a bad neighbourhood. There&#x27;s nothing anyone can do for you, the people there are Irish.&quot; He was Irish himself. &quot;They don&#x27;t want black people living there.&quot; But he didn&#x27;t say black. &quot;They don&#x27;t want anyone in that house, you should move.&quot; &quot;We can&#x27;t move.&quot; My mother said. &quot;We don&#x27;t have any money. If you can&#x27;t do anything then tell me where your precinct is.&quot; We went to the police station where the officer worked. We spoke to another police officer there. &quot;You should move.&quot; he said. A lot of black people were cowed and put down, so they rarely spoke up for themselves, thankfully my mother was not like that. &quot;We cannot afford to move, surely the estate agency should be held accountable if no one wants someone living in that house. Now if you&#x27;re not willing to help, I&#x27;ll tell you what to do.&quot; &quot;What?&quot; asked the officer. &quot;Drive me home.&quot; Said my mother. We were driven home by the police in a cart pulled by horses. There were bells on the cart that would clang. Clang, clang, clang. Everyone came out of their houses to see what the noise was over. My mother stood up and spoke to everyone. She told them that we had no money, we had paid rent for a month (we had to pay in advance), we didn&#x27;t know what would happen in a month but we couldn&#x27;t leave before then. She told them that we were different from them but that didn&#x27;t give them a reason to treat us badly. After that my father became ill, but the neighbours were as nice as they could be to us.</p>

The Irish people of the area do not like Black people, although he did not use that term.

<h2>Recall 63e52debbbb982734deba89a</h2>
<p>A black family had recently moved into a new neighbourhood of predominantly Irish people. This was in the 1920s. The father went out {he tended to drink) and left his wife and children at home. it was evening time. The mother needed to go and get sosme food so went out to the jewish shop that stayed open longest. She told the eldest child who was 10 to look after the younger children. Suddenly there was a crash that scared the children greatly. The eldest hurried the children under the stairwell for protection and told them to stay there and that they would be safe. 
A stone had been thrown through their house window. T

The child was scared but went out to find their mother, correctly guessing where she would be and told her what had happened. She was angry and aggrieved at the unfairness of it. They were black but they paid their rent like everyone else. if they didnt want them there why had they allowed them to rent.
There was a policeman passing and the mother stopped him asking for him to come and help find who had done this. Although he was sssympathetic to a degree he said the only thing he could suggest was that they moved somewhere else.
The mother said she had paid the rent for a month and there was no way she would move. Her job as a mother was to protect her children. The child was proud of his mother who was educated and strong.
As the policeman would not help she asked to be taken to someone more senior who could help. Again the answer was that all that they could suggest was that she move.
She and the child were taken in the horse drawn police wagon back home. The clanging of the bell alerted the neighbourhood who came out to watch what was happening.
The mother alighted and spoke to them saying that apart from the colour of their skin they were all the same. She had paid rent for a month and she was staying for a month. if they wanted to move her they could pay her rent to live elsewhere.
A while later the father became ill and the people in the neighbourhood behaved towards the family with kindness and empathy.

<p>A Black family moved to a new neighbourhood. Someone smashed a window in the family&#x27;s home as it was an Irish area and they didn&#x27;t want any Black people there. The mother called the police but they would not do anything.
So the mother went to the police station to complain. Again the police said they could do nothing as they had no evidence. When the mother got back from the station she said to the neighbours that no matter what they did, she and her family would be staying there for at least a month because she had paid for a month and could not afford to move again unless the people paid her to leave, which is something they would not do and probably could not afford to do.
In the end it turned out ok and the family got on well with the neighbours.</p>

<p>There was a ten-year-old child who was babysitting one day when, out of nowhere, something struck the window. Their parents were not at home, and they lived in a Jewish neighborhood. Startled by the incident, the child quickly gathered the other kids and moved them to safety.

The child then decided to investigate what had hit the window. While searching for their mom at a nearby store, they caught the attention of an Irish police officer. The officer inquired why the child appeared scared.

When the mom finally arrived and learned about the incident, she asked the officer for assistance. However, the officer regretfully responded, &quot;I can&#x27;t do anything about it.&quot; The mom became upset and requested the officer&#x27;s captain&#x27;s name so she could discuss the matter at the police station.

Upon speaking to the police captain, she was met with a similar response. The captain explained that their hands were tied, and they couldn&#x27;t take any action. Frustrated, the mom expressed her inability to move out of the neighborhood due to financial constraints.</p>

<p>One evening when we lived on the corner of 4th and Westbuty my father went out with the team of horses, and then my mother went out and I was there. There was a huge crash and a stone came through the window. I took the others under the stairs and I said you staay there, I&#x27;m gonna get Mam, we called our mother mam in those days. I knew she would be shopping somewhere on fourth because there were shops there and they kept open late because they - jews - wanted to make as much as they could. I found here there and told her. There was a policeman there and my voice was so low and shaky that he asked what the problem was. My mother told him and asked him what he could do. I can&#x27;t do nothing, he said the Irish don&#x27;t like a black living there - he didn&#x27;t use the work black, it wasn&#x27;t used then. So what can i do, my mother said. You&#x27;ll have to move he said. I can&#x27;t move she said, I don&#x27;t have any money. I paid rent in advance so I just can&#x27;t move. Why did they let me rent it if they don&#x27;t want us there. Where is your precinct. He told us and we went there. Captain, she said, what can you do. Nothing he said, I&#x27;m Irish too, all you can do is move. I can&#x27;t move she said. I&#x27;ll tell you one thing you can do for us, take us there in your horse and wagon. He said yes, probably he just wanted to get rid of this woman. He hadn&#x27;t seen anyone like her before. She was the only black woman I knew who had finished High School. We sat in back of the carriage and the bell wne Clang clang. You know those trams go Clang, well this went Clang Clang Clang. When we got to the house the policeman opened the long back door and we had to walk down the steps. A crowd was looking at us. My mother said. I can&#x27;t afford to move from here for a month because I paid rent in advance. It&#x27;s winter and cold. I can&#x27;t afford to new windows. I&#x27;m just like you except for skin wise. I am just the same. So they just accepted us from then on and when my father got sick they all helped and treated us just like one of them. The year probably was nineteen twenty five.</p>

<p>A brother and his siblings were left home by their parents. Some unknown people threw stones at the windows of their home, this frightened the 10-year-old and his sisters. he got them to a safe spot on the stairway and went about to look for his mother. He found her at some Jewish shop doing some grocery shopping. He relayed the story of what had happened to his mother, there was a police officer in the vicinity. The boy told the cop what had happened the cop said there was nothing they could do about it and suggested that the boy and his mother move to another neighborhood. Since the area was Irish the boy and his mother were black. The boy&#x27;s mother refused to move and requested to be taken to the precinct to speak to someone else who could help her. They got on a horse cart as this was back in the 1925s. At the precinct, she was told the same story about not being able to be assisted especially with the identity of the perpetrators not being known. After realizing that she was not getting the help she required she asked to be escorted back home by the police patrol, which had a bell that clanged. The clanging noise aroused the curiosity of the neighbors, they came out of their homes to see what was happening. She got out and addressed them, telling them that unless they were willing to make donations towards her getting her down payment for her monthly rent for the house there was no way she was going anywhere for at least a month as she couldn&#x27;t afford to pay rent elsewhere. So she was stuck with them and they were stuck with her for at least a month until she could find somewhere else. That was their welcoming into the neighborhood. From then neighbors started warming up to them and would step in to help whenever something happened even the boy&#x27;s father got ill.</p>

<p>A black family moved into a neighborhood. One day something was thrown into the window and shattered the glass. The narrator - a child - ran and found their mother, who reported it to someone (can&#x27;t recall who). That person said the trouble was owing to the neighborhood being largely Irish and that they didn&#x27;t want black people living there. The person noted that they themselves were Irish too.  So the mother went to report it to the police, and asked what they would do about it. The police said there was nothing they could do and could only advise that the family moved somewhere else. The mother said that she can&#x27;t afford to move but asked that police at least give them a lift home in the police car.  Given that it was in the 1920s, the car had a bell that clanged (like the &#x27;clang clang&#x27; of a trolley)as they went. The noise caused a small crowd to assemble when then they arrived in the neighborhood. When she got out of the car the mother asked the crowd why they were &#x27;doing this&#x27; to them; that they were just like them only looked different.  (at this stage I got distracted and sleepy and missed a few lines). Towards the end the neighbors were friendly. </p>

<p>A black family live together in a rented house in a Jewish or Irish neighbourhood on fourth street. One day, after the father had had a drink whilst moving furand the mother had gone out,some people started throwing stones at the house, breaking the windows. The daughter was inside and was very afraid and trying to look after the young children in the house and protect them. They ended up calling the police who didn&#x27;t do anything so they went to the precinct where they explained the situation. These police also didn&#x27;t do much so the mother asked for a lift back to the house. On the way back, around 5th Street, they saw all the neighbours. The mother was quite smart as she had completed school , finishing around 1925 and spoke to all the neighbours. She told them that apart from their colour, they were the same as everyone else. They paid their rent and didn&#x27;t have any money to currently move,  explaining that they would stay in the rented house for another month, as they had paid for this.</p>

<p>From what I recall from the story, there was some racism for black people in an Irish neighborhood. The mother and the child both had to to deal with tough times. The mother/child received word that they could not provide for the child properly, at least that was what the child was complaining about. I know that the mother went to a high school in 1925. I remember something about Younge street. The story was taking place in Canada I believe. That is all I recall words were moving fast. - Thanks  </p>

<p>There is a family that just moved to a rental house on Third and Wharton. The story is told from the perspective of a child aged 10 and set around 1925 so there are horses and carts. The father was a drunk and had to go out and get the horses. The mother left the house and came back on that day. When the whole family was in the house a stone came crashing through the window and broke it. There were people outside throwing stones at the house. The narrator gathered the younger children in the stairway so they would not be harmed and the mother ran out of the house. The narrator followed. They went to fourth street because that was a Jewish neighbourhood where things were open late and there were horses and carts. They came across a policeman who was Irish. He said it is a bad neighbourhood and an Irish one. He said they don&#x27;t want black people living there and that is why the stone was thrown at the window and told the mother they should just move. The mother and narrator walk to the precint on fifth street where the policeman worked. She spoke to another police who told her the same thing and she should move. She said that they do not have the money and they gave all their money for rent and the least he could do was take them home. The policeman took them in a police horse and cart with a large bell on it. So all the neighbours came out of their homes to see it. The mother then tells them how she has no money and will definitely be there for the month but maybe not longer if they cannot afford the next months rent. She tells the crowd that they can give her money to move if they don&#x27;t want them there but they do not give money. The father becomes ill during this and the neighbours act nice and help. The mother said they cannot afford to fix the window and it is cold. </p>

<h2>Recall 603659d5c391045d1e4b332b</h2>
<p>We moved to Third and Whardoff. My father went out - did I tell you he drank? And my mother went to the store to get some things for our home. When my father left people began throwing stones - stones flying through the window. Of course, I was left at home with the children. So I rushed them to the stairway, because that was the only place where they wouldn&#x27;t get hit by flying glass. Once they were there I said &quot;You stay here, I am going to get mom&quot; (We called our mother mom). I ran out the door and didn&#x27;t know what to expect. I ran to Fourth. The neighbourhood was Jewish, and so the stores stayed open until late. Any bit of money they could earn, they did. When I reached my mother I couldn&#x27;t make sense in what I was saying. A passing policeman heard the commotion and wanted to find out why I was in such a state. Once he found out, he told my mother that the neighbourhood is Irish, and that we should move out because we&#x27;re black. He didn&#x27;t say &#x27;black&#x27; but he said &quot;They don&#x27;t want somebody living there&quot;. My mother said to him that she had spent all of her savings on that months rent, and didn&#x27;t have enough to move. She said &quot;You&#x27;re civil service, you must protect us&quot;. He said that he couldn&#x27;t do that - he was Irish too. My mother asked &quot;Where is the precinct you work&quot;. He told her, but I don&#x27;t remember the exact details, even though I was standing with my mother. We went to the precinct and spoke to the head officer, but he told my mother the same thing &quot;Move away&quot;. She explained the situation to him, but he said he couldn&#x27;t help. She finally said &quot;The least you can do is drive me home&quot;. So he did. The police car, hors and cart, mad a clanging sound. Clang clang clang. As we turned the corner - the precinct wasn&#x27;t far, maybe on Fifth - everyone turned and came out of their homes to hear the noise. The policeman sat up front, and we were let out the wide back door of the cart. As my mother got out she turned to face all the people and asked &quot;Why do you do this to me? We are the same, maybe not color wise, but in every other respect, we are the same. I have spent all of my savings on moving here. We are living here for a month at least, I don&#x27;t have enough to move away. I am just trying to provide a home for my family. I don&#x27;t have enough money to fix my windows, so unless you want to get together and pay for me to move, I am staying for a month&quot;. Of course they didn&#x27;t pay, but during that month, my father got sick. The people were as sweet as can be.</p>

<p>The child was left home alone except for his/her siblings because his mum had gone shopping and his father had gone to (I think) take some horses back to their stables. Shortly after his mother left there was a huge crash and a window in the house was smashed. The child was afraid, but he managed to move the younger children into the stairwell where no stones could reach. He ran out to look for his mother who was shopping in the Jewish area, where shop-keepers worked long hours to maximise their income. He managed to find her and tell her what had happened. She asked for directions to the police station and she, and the child, went there. The police were sympathetic but unable to offer any help. They didn&#x27;t expressly say it, but they indicated that the trouble was because the family are black and this is a predominantly Irish neighbourhood. Their only suggestion was that she move the family into a different area. The mother was indignant at this and pointed out that she could not afford to move again. As the police could not offer any help, she asked them to at least take her and the child home, which they did, in a noisy, horse-drawn police vehicle. The noise brought out all her neighbours, which gave the mdother the opportunity to address them all. She told them that she could not afford to move, she had paid a month&#x27;s rent on the property and would be there for at least that time. After that, who knew. She was defiant and strong when she spoke to them, pointed out that other than skin colour they were the same and that she should be allowed to live there in peace.</p>

My mother left the house to buy some food from the Jewish shop as they stayed open all hours. I was in charge of the children. I was ten years old.

The house was stoned. I ran out of the house to find my mother. When I was telling her what happened, a policeman heard me. He said it was a rough area and that the Irish didn&#x27;t want black people there, though he didn&#x27;t say black. My mother asked him what he was going to do and he said there was nothing he could do and we should move. He was Irish too. My mother said we had spent the money on rent for a month so couldn&#x27;t move. She asked him where his station was and we went there to see the captain but he said the same. The captain wasn&#x27;t used to a black woman standing up for herself as most were cowed by the white people. She made him bring us home in the police patrol, which was a cart with horses. It was 1925. At the house, she told the people waiting that she would be there for the month as she had paid the rent and that, apart from being black, she was the same as them.

<p>We arrived at 3rd &amp; Wharton, it was olden times. We were in the front room when we heard a crash, looked and there was a stone in the middle of the room. They were smashing the windows. Mum took us to the stairs so we wouldn’t get hit by flying glass. We were told it was an Irish neighbourhood and they didn’t want black people there. Mum told them she had paid all the money she had to move in, so there was no way she would move out. She said it was the real estate agents fault. This was in 1925 and horse pulled police cabins. We rode in one and went home. It was a very terrifying experience for me.</p>

<p>In the 1920s, a boy was living with her mother and father and siblings in an irish neighborhood. they were a black family who rented in an irish neighborhood for a month, the boy&#x27;s father went to attend the horses outside and the mother went to fourth street which is a market. The boy was home alone with just his younger siblings when he heard a loud noise crashing through the window. The loud crash was a rock that was thrown through the window. the boy managed to keep his siblings protected from the window glass by standing on the staircase. he was scared and ran outside to find his mom at fourth street.
When the boy found his mother there was surprisingly a policeman passing by. He managed to explain the story of what happened to the policeman and his mother. the policeman was understanding but mentioned that there was nothing he could do to help, probably due to the racial segregation existing at those times. The mother was relentless and opted to go to the nearest police station to find someone to help with this matter if this policeman can&#x27;t. She went to the police station where they told her the same thing and suggested she moved out. She mentions she can&#x27;t move out because she paid the rent for the month with her last money and asked the policeman take her home in his carriage instead. when she arrived she told the irish people in the neighborhood if the want her to leave they must collectively contribute enough money for her to move out because she doesn&#x27;t have any money left over to move out. After her speech, the neighborhood treated her better and more neighborly after that.</p>

<p>We move to a new neighbourhood. We made from a different neighbourhood as my dad was an alcoholic. We moved in and my dad went out to drink. My mum went out to go shopping. I was left at home. Then a stone came through the window and smash the window. I was scared. But I went outside and there were people. I didn’t know what to do. I had to look after the children. The children were in the hallway. I had to find my mum.

My mum had gone to a place a place where you can get what you want for money. A shop. My mum was shopping. I found my mum and tried to tell her what had happened. A police man had come by and tried to say what had happened. The policeman said this is a bad neighbourhood. People called us black but they didn’t say black back them. My mum asked the police man to help but he said he couldn’t help. He said we should move. This is a bad neighbourhood. This is an Irish neighbourhood. my mum said you need to find who did this. The policeman said he could not help you did not see them. You do not know who to blame. He told my mum that we should move. But she said she couldn’t move. She paid rent upfront. This is all the money she had. The estate agent is to blame if they didn’t want us living here they should’ve rented us the house. My mum told the police officer to take us back in the patrol car. We drove back home in the patrol car. When we got back home we had to get out the back of the patrol car. It was one of those ones that have steps to get out the back. As we were driving, the car goes, clang clang clang, that’s the sound of the car. When we got back all the neighbours had come out to see what was happening. My mum said that if you don’t want us here you can’t do anything I have rented this house. I have spent all my money on rent. I will be here for a month I can’t afford windows. my mum was smart. She went to high school. This is 1925. Soon after we moved in my dad got sick. The neighbours were supportive like you would expect. The neighbours did what you would expect neighbours to do. </p>

<p>The incident the narrator is telling took place in 1925 in New York City. The narrator was 10 years old at the time and he and his family had just rented a house and moved their furniture in. It was an IRish neighbourhood and not integrated. They must have been the first black family that had tried to live there. The father and the mother had had to go out separately on errands, leaving the narrator to look after his siblings. Suddenly a rock came through the front window, followed by a shower of other stones. The narrator hid his siblings on the stairs where they would be safe from flying glass and went out to find his mom, who was shopping in the Jewish neighbourhood a little way away. He was telling his mom about the attack when a policeman came by and heard their conversation. The policeman, who was Irish himself said that he couldn&#x27;t do anything, especially since the narrator didn&#x27;t know who had attacked them. The policeman said that the only thing they could do was move out of the neighbourhood. The mother stood up to the policeman and said she could not move for lack of money and that they had paid a month&#x27;s rent in advance. Perhaps the real estate agent should not have rented them the house? Then they went to the police station, where the other policemen were equally unhelpful, advising them to move out. But the police drove them home and the whole neighbourhood saw them arrive in the police wagon. The mother then explained to the neighbours that she realized they were different but she couldn&#x27;t move because it was winter and she had no money to go anywhere else. Eventually, the neighbours actually became helpful and showed the kind of solidarity neighbours should show to each other.</p>

She went to the police to complain. She was being kicked out of her place, and she just wanted a place for her family. Her son was telling the story. There was a lot of stuttering and repetition.</p>

I went out to look for my mom who I spotted near a Jewish neighbourhood, their shops were always open till late because they wanted to make money. I told her what had happened when we spotted a policeman. My mom told him what had happened but he wasn&#x27;t interested in helping us. He implied that people of our colour didn&#x27;t belong in an Irish neighbourhood. My mom enquired about this his precinct and then we made our way there. We went through various cases ad they admitted that they couldn&#x27;t help, so my mom asked them to take us back in a patrol car. When we returned, my mom spoke to the people in the neighbourhood and asked them to either give us enough money to move out or leave as be.

<h2>Recall 64ac5569f232b08a6da326bd</h2>
<p>The story is told from the perspective of a 10-year-old child. The family, a mom, dad, and 2 - 3 children (not sure if it said), had just moved into a house in a predominately Irish area. The dad went out to check on the horses, while the mom went to the store down the road (on Fifth) that was run by Jewish people and open 24 hours. When the kids were home alone, somebody(ies) threw a rock into one of their windows. At this time, the narrator explains how they put their siblings into a room or closet nearby and told them that they would be safe there. The narrator then runs to the store their mom went to and starts explaining what was happening. A police officer arrives and they explain to the police officer what has happened. The police officer tells them that this neighborhood is Irish and that they do not like the new family living in that house because they are black. Since this was 1925, there has been A LOT of outward racial prejudice, racism, and oppression. The police officer told them to move, to which the mom had made him aware that they did not have enough money to move and that they spent all their money on the rent for this new place. The mom then asked to go to the precinct where this officer works and the officer took the mom and child to the precinct. Here, the mom spoke with another officer (possibly a supervisor) about the situation and got a pretty similar response. She reiterated that she had to spend all of the money paying for rent upfront. She also states that they should not have rented to her if they did not want her there and that the realtor should be liable. The police officer also asked the child if they saw the face of the person who threw the rock, to which the kid did not and the police officer stated they cannot do anything without anyone to blame. With this, the mom asked the officer to give them a ride home. The officer took them home in a horse and buggy with bells on it. The bells were being rung as they arrived home (making a &quot;clang&quot; sound, as described) and the neighbors were outside watching. The mom and child were let out, walking down the steps from the buggy/carriage to peering eyes. The mom then addressed people in the neighbourhood letting them know that the family will be there for the month since they have already paid, that they do not have enough money to move, and don&#x27;t know if they will even have enough money for next month&#x27;s rent. She then posited that if they do not want them to live there, they can raise the funds themselves to move them out. The narrator then continues to explain that nobody raised the funds themselves, speculating that they don&#x27;t have the money either and that the neighbors were being as &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;typical&quot; as one can hope. We also learn that the father falls ill. </p>

<p>A family moved into a new neighbourhood, they were a black family, different from everyone else in the area which was composed of irish people. As soon as they moved into the house some locals threw stones through the family&#x27;s windows causing the younger members of the family to be scared.
The mother of the family requested help from the police officer, who was also irish and he wasn&#x27;t very helpful, he seemed to share the same disdain for the family, though more veiled due to his position. The officers only solution to the familys predicament was to move away, the mother said she couldnt possibly since she has just moved in, paid for a months rent so told the officer and whoever else nearby that was listening that they have no choice but to accept that they will be there for at least a month and if they want them to leave that badly they should pool together enough money so they can afford to move away, they of course didn&#x27;t do this since they are likely struggling just as much as them.

<h2>Recall 5954fca53e9d73000192588f</h2>
<p>The child was around 10 years old and had recently moved in to a rented house in a new neighbourhood. The child had been in the house with their siblings. The child&#x27;s mother had gone to the shop and the child&#x27;s father had gone to tend the horses. While the parents were away the house was stoned. The child tried to make their siblings safe and then left the house to find their mother.

They found the mother at the shop and while trying to communicate to her what had happened they were overheard by a policeman. The mother asked the policeman for assistance but he replied there was nothing he could do. He suggested that the family should move to another area (there appears to have been issues with racism in the neighbourhood). The mother advised that moving was unaffordable and went with the child to the police station to seek assistance.

At the police station the mother confronted another police officer and asked for assistance. The officer declined to investigate as no suspects had been identified. The officer was not prepared to make any effort to investigate or find the criminals. The mother is described as being educated, having completed high school and despite experiencing prejudice and discrimination was not afraid to try and secure her basic rights. 

The mother requested that she and her child were transported back to the property in the police vehicle. The police vehicle was a horse drawn cart with a bell.

On arriving at the property the mother and child exited the police vehicle and the mother addressed her neighbours who had gathered nearby. She explained the she had paid a month rent and could not afford to move, nor could she afford the cost of window replacement. She acknowledged that despite the difference in her skin colour she had much in common with others in the neighbourhood.

Speaking frankly appears to have made an impact as the description of how the family were treated after this shows some improvement, especially when the father became ill. </p>

<p>It was 1930 in the USA. I&#x27;m a black child aged 10 and we&#x27;d just moved into an Irish neighbourhood. My father had gone out and hadn&#x27;t returned so we were worried. Suddenly, stones began hitting the windows, so my mother went out to see what was happening, and I went with her. We saw that people were throwing stones at our house. We found a police officer, who advised us to move out of the neighbourhood as we wouldn&#x27;t be welcome.

We went to the police station to report the incident. My mother told the office in charge that the police should protect them. He asked if my mother had seen the face of anyone throwing stones. She said she hadn&#x27;t, so the officer asked how he could punish anyone if he didn&#x27;t know who to punish. 

My mother asked him to drive us home, so he did. To my admiration, my mother said to the stone-throwers that we&#x27;d just moved in to the house and we didn&#x27;t have enough money to pay to move out, so she asked the people to collectively find enough money to give us so we could move out. People didn&#x27;t give us any money, but they did leave us alone. However, the whole experience made my father unwell.</p>

The police arrived and explained to the family that it is because they are in an irish community. and that their kind if not welcome, they are most likely a black family. The cop says there is nothing they can do and suggest that the family moves. The family is in shock and cant believe that this how the police answered them.</p>
