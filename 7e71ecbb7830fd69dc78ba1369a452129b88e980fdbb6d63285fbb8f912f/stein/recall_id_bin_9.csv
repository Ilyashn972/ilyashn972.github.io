There was a huge crash and a stone came through the window. I took the others under the stairs and I said you stay there, I'm gonna get Mam, we called our mother mam in those days. I knew she would be shopping somewhere on fourth because there were shops there and they kept open late because they - jews - wanted to make as much as they could. I found her there and told her. There was a policeman there and my voice was so low and shaky that he asked what the problem was. My mother told him and asked him what he could do. I can't do nothing, he said the Irish don't like a black living there - he didn't use the work black, it wasn't used then. So what can i do, my mother said. You'll have to move he said. I can't move she said, I don't have any money. I paid rent in advance so I just can't move. Why did they let me rent it if they don't want us there. Where is your precinct. He told us and we went there. Captain, she said, what can you do. Nothing he said, I'm Irish too, all you can do is move. I can't move she said. I'll tell you one thing you can do for us, take us there in your horse and wagon. He said yes, probably he just wanted to get rid of this woman. He hadn't seen anyone like her before. She was the only black woman I knew who had finished High School. We sat in back of the carriage and the bell went Clang clang. You know those trams go Clang, well this went Clang Clang Clang. When we got to the house the policeman opened the long back door and we had to walk down the steps. A crowd was looking at us. My mother said. I can't afford to move from here for a month because I paid rent in advance. It's winter and cold. I can't afford to new windows. I'm just like you except for skin wise. I am just the same. So they just accepted us from then on and when my father got sick they all helped and treated us just like one of them. The year probably was nineteen twenty five."

The ten year old was home alone with their young siblings whilst the mom was out to do some late night shopping in the Jewish shops that opened until very late. The ten year old was faced with a challenge of calming their siblings down and ask them to hide in a place where they would not be hit by the stones. The ten year old later ran out to look for the mom, being careful not to be hit by the stones. They finally found the mom in the Jewish stores and let her know what was happening. Whilst the ten year old was trying to tell their mom, they could not breathe or even utter the words properly because due to being frightened. There were police patrollers around who kind of understood what the ten year old was trying to say and they warned the mom about the area. They advised her to move to another area, as that area was not ""good for them"", and according to them people like them(blacks) were not welcomed in the area. The mother told the patrol that there's no way that they can move because they had just moved in and paid rent, and the people took their money. The mom insisted that the police help them and they told her that there's nothing they can do. She went to the station with them and asked them to take them home, which they did. Eventually the family felt accepted in the neighbourhood when their father fell ill, the neighbours came by to visit them and sent well wishes. This all happened within the Irish community during around 1925."

The family, a mom, dad, and 2 - 3 children (not sure if it said), had just moved into a house in a predominately Irish area. The dad went out to check on the horses, while the mom went to the store down the road (on Fifth) that was run by Jewish people and open 24 hours. When the kids were home alone, somebody(ies) threw a rock into one of their windows. At this time, the narrator explains how they put their siblings into a room or closet nearby and told them that they would be safe there. The narrator then runs to the store their mom went to and starts explaining what was happening. A police officer arrives and they explain to the police officer what has happened. The police officer tells them that this neighborhood is Irish and that they do not like the new family living in that house because they are black. Since this was 1925, there has been A LOT of outward racial prejudice, racism, and oppression. The police officer told them to move, to which the mom had made him aware that they did not have enough money to move and that they spent all their money on the rent for this new place. The mom then asked to go to the precinct where this officer works and the officer took the mom and child to the precinct. Here, the mom spoke with another officer (possibly a supervisor) about the situation and got a pretty similar response. She reiterated that she had to spend all of the money paying for rent upfront. She also states that they should not have rented to her if they did not want her there and that the realtor should be liable. The police officer also asked the child if they saw the face of the person who threw the rock, to which the kid did not and the police officer stated they cannot do anything without anyone to blame. With this, the mom asked the officer to give them a ride home. The officer took them home in a horse and buggy with bells on it. The bells were being rung as they arrived home (making a ""clang"" sound, as described) and the neighbors were outside watching. The mom and child were let out, walking down the steps from the buggy/carriage to peering eyes. The mom then addressed people in the neighbourhood letting them know that the family will be there for the month since they have already paid, that they do not have enough money to move, and don't know if they will even have enough money for next month's rent. She then posited that if they do not want them to live there, they can raise the funds themselves to move them out. The narrator then continues to explain that nobody raised the funds themselves, speculating that they don't have the money either and that the neighbors were being as ""normal"" or ""typical"" as one can hope. We also learn that the father falls ill."

It was one of those ones that have steps to get out the back. As we were driving, the car goes, clang clang clang, that’s the sound of the car.

She asked what precinct he worked out of. The mother went to the precinct on fifth street and spoke to the captain. She recalled of seeing lots of police patrols and horses. The captain was equally unhelpful. Saying that because they never seen who threw the stones there is nothing they can do. The mother spoke loud and long.

There were people outside throwing stones at the house. The narrator gathered the younger children in the stairway so they would not be harmed and the mother ran out of the house. The narrator followed. They went to fourth street because that was a Jewish neighbourhood where things were open late and there were horses and carts. They came across a policeman who was Irish. He said it is a bad neighbourhood and an Irish one. He said they don't want black people living there and that is why the stone was thrown at the window and told the mother they should just move. The mother and narrator walk to the precint on fifth street where the policeman worked. She spoke to another police who told her the same thing and she should move. She said that they do not have the money and they gave all their money for rent and the least he could do was take them home. The policeman took them in a police horse and cart with a large bell on it. So all the neighbours came out of their homes to see it.

My mother had gone to the store to get some groceries on Fourth, not long after my mom, we call mother mom had gone to the store and my father had gone out there was stones being thrown at our house, I quickly moved my siblings to hide under the stairwell, I told them ""Do not move because you will be safe here and no stone will hit you"". I was very frightened but prepared myself to go look for my mother, but was not sure what would happen immediately I stepped through the door and ran to Fourth as that's where the carts where being pushed, I looked for my mom and found her and while trying to explain what had happened, a police officer happened to pass by, so after I composed myself a bit, I explained to him what had happened and all he could say to my mother and I was ""You have to move"" the town is Irish, my mom being angry and asked how he could say something like that and explained we had only moved here recently and she doesn't have money to move again. The officer said he could not do anything as it sort of a norm here as we are black, he didn't say black because they didn't say that then but that's basically what he meant, the officer was Irish as well. My mom angrily asked for his station and to speak to the captain. We went over to the police station which wasn't too far from where we were, it was on Fifth. We entered and demanded to speak to the captain, we explained the situation and he basically said the same thing as the police officer. I was surprised and impressed by my mom, she stood her ground as she was more educated having gone to school in nineteen twenty-five. She explained to the captain that we have only moved here and have no money to go someplace else, and he said there was not much he could do as there was no one to blame, he also asked me if it was possible that there have been multiple people, which would make it harder to but the blame on someone. My mother suggested arresting the real estate agents as they sold the property to her despite knowing the situation in the town. My mother then said the least they could do was to drop off home and since the captain was tired of us being there because the conversation was long and loud he agreed. We went into the station patrol vehicle that had a bell attached to it and made a  ""Clang clang clang"" sound as we moved, during the journey, due to the bell a number of people came out of their homes to watch what was going on. When we reached our house, my mom turned to address the people watching, she said we had just moved here and paid money for rent for the month and that we were going to stay for the month and that after that she didn't know, she also told them apart from the colour of their skin they were all the same people and that they should get used to us being here. She also suggested that if they all really wanted us to leave they should donate money for the family to move somewhere else, which they didn't because they probably didn't have any money either. After that day, everyone seemed to be nicer and even when my dad was sick they helped and offered whatever they had just like anyone else would.
