When they arrived a stone was thrown into their window. The police arrived and explained to the family that it is because they are in an Irish community. and that their kind if not welcome, they are most likely a black family. The cop says there is nothing they can do and suggest that the family moves. The family is in shock and can't believe that this how the police answered them."

The mother and the child both had to deal with tough times. The mother/child received word that they could not provide for the child properly, at least that was what the child was complaining about. I know that the mother went to a high school in 1925. I remember something about Younge street. The story was taking place in Canada I believe. That is all I recall words were moving fast. Thanks."

When they arrived someone stoned their windows. As the father was drunk, the narrator ran to find the Mum who they thought would know how to resolve the situation given her schooling at Lackanawny. The 'Mom' sought and found a policeman on the street. He said he would like to help but there was nothing he could do even though, or in spite of, he was Irish too. So they went to the station on 5th and explained the situation, how they had the windows stoned, how it would make their place unbearable in the cold of winter as they had no money to fix it. The police at the station also said there was nothing they could do but did offer her a ride back in the police wagon, a wagon still driven by horses even though it was 1925. They were thankful she accepted as she talked long and hard. Clang, Clang clang went the bells as they went down the street which caused all the neighbours to come onto the street upon the wagon's arrival to see what the fuss was about. The mother took the opportunity to explain to those gathered that she had used all the family money to pay a full months rent so she was staying the month, in these cold winter days she was, colour aside, just like them in that she wanted to put a roof over her children's head and if the locals didn't want them there because they were black then they'd have to provide the money for them to move on. Naturally, this didn't happen, as likely the locals were in the same financial predicament. However after this episode they became much friendlier, helping out wherever possible in times of need such as when the drunken father became ill."

The neighborhood was Jewish. My mom had just went to the market so I stayed with the kids. I was ten years old at the time. Clang clang clang. The people in the community threw stones at our windows and they got broken so I searched high and low for my mother. When I had explained to her what happened she reported it to the police officer. The police officer said there's nothing much he can do. He suggested we move. But my mom told him that we had just moved from where we were staying and now we should move again because this community doesn't like the color of our skin. She told him that we are the same people just a different color of skin. She continued to tell him how she paid a month's rent so she's not moving. If these people want her to move they should give her money to do so because she doesn't have any. She also said that the agent should've not taken her money because she knows how this community will react to our family staying there. The police officer told my mom that the people of this community don't have money either and therefore can't give any to her so she can leave. My mom said she will stay the entire month because she paid for it. The community will have to accept them.

This was in the 1920s. The father went out (he tended to drink) and left his wife and children at home. It was evening time. The mother needed to go and get some food so went out to the Jewish shop that stayed open longest. She told the eldest child who was 10 to look after the younger children. Suddenly there was a crash that scared the children greatly. The eldest hurried the children under the stairwell for protection and told them to stay there and that they would be safe. A stone had been thrown through their house window. The child was scared but went out to find their mother, correctly guessing where she would be and told her what had happened. She was angry and aggrieved at the unfairness of it. They were black but they paid their rent like everyone else. If they didn't want them there why had they allowed them to rent. There was a policeman passing and the mother stopped him asking for him to come and help find who had done this. Although he was sympathetic to a degree he said the only thing he could suggest was that they moved somewhere else. The mother said she had paid the rent for a month and there was no way she would move. Her job as a mother was to protect her children. The child was proud of his mother who was educated and strong. As the policeman would not help she asked to be taken to someone more senior who could help. Again the answer was that all that they could suggest was that she move. She and the child were taken in the horse drawn police wagon back home. The clanging of the bell alerted the neighbourhood who came out to watch what was happening. The mother alighted and spoke to them saying that apart from the colour of their skin they were all the same. She had paid rent for a month and she was staying for a month. If they wanted to move her they could pay her rent to live elsewhere. A while later the father became ill and the people in the neighbourhood behaved towards the family with kindness and empathy."

The boy told the cop what had happened. The cop said there was nothing they could do about it. The cop suggested that the boy and his mother move to another neighborhood. Since the area was Irish, the boy and his mother were black. The boy's mother refused to move. She requested to be taken to the precinct to speak to someone else who could help her. They got on a horse cart as this was back in the 1925s. At the precinct, she was told the same story about not being able to be assisted. Especially with the identity of the perpetrators not being known. After realizing that she was not getting the help she required, she asked to be escorted back home by the police patrol. The police patrol had a bell that clanged. The clanging noise aroused the curiosity of the neighbors. They came out of their homes to see what was happening. She got out and addressed them. She told them that unless they were willing to make donations towards her getting her down payment for her monthly rent for the house, there was no way she was going anywhere. She couldn't afford to pay rent elsewhere for at least a month. So she was stuck with them and they were stuck with her for at least a month until she could find somewhere else. That was their welcoming into the neighborhood. From then, neighbors started warming up to them. They would step in to help whenever something happened. Even the boy's father got ill."

My father went out - did I tell you he drank? And my mother went to the store to get some things for our home. When my father left people began throwing stones - stones flying through the window. Of course, I was left at home with the children. So I rushed them to the stairway, because that was the only place where they wouldn't get hit by flying glass. Once they were there I said ""You stay here, I am going to get mom"" (We called our mother mom). I ran out the door and didn't know what to expect. I ran to Fourth. The neighbourhood was Jewish, and so the stores stayed open until late. Any bit of money they could earn, they did. When I reached my mother I couldn't make sense in what I was saying. A passing policeman heard the commotion and wanted to find out why I was in such a state. Once he found out, he told my mother that the neighbourhood is Irish, and that we should move out because we're black. He didn't say 'black' but he said ""They don't want somebody living there"". My mother said to him that she had spent all of her savings on that months rent, and didn't have enough to move. She said ""You're civil service, you must protect us"". He said that he couldn't do that - he was Irish too. My mother asked ""Where is the precinct you work"". He told her, but I don't remember the exact details, even though I was standing with my mother. We went to the precinct and spoke to the head officer, but he told my mother the same thing ""Move away"". She explained the situation to him, but he said he couldn't help. She finally said ""The least you can do is drive me home"". So he did. The police car, hors and cart, mad a clanging sound. Clang clang clang. As we turned the corner - the precinct wasn't far, maybe on Fifth - everyone turned and came out of their homes to hear the noise. The policeman sat up front, and we were let out the wide back door of the cart. As my mother got out she turned to face all the people and asked ""Why do you do this to me? We are the same, maybe not color wise, but in every other respect, we are the same. I have spent all of my savings on moving here. We are living here for a month at least, I don't have enough to move away. I am just trying to provide a home for my family. I don't have enough money to fix my windows, so unless you want to get together and pay for me to move, I am staying for a month"". Of course they didn't pay, but during that month, my father got sick. The people were as sweet as can be."
