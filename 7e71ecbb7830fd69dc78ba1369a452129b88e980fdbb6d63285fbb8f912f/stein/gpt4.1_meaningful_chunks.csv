And then of course they – they – well they stoned the house.,A stone crashed through the window and the house was stoned
"(14, 17)","And I had sense enough to get the kids into the stairway so that they wouldn't get hurt by flyin' glass. And I said to them, “Now you stay there.

"(61, 65)","Well in those days black people were so cowed by circumstances an' uniforms and white people, you know, they uh many times didn't assert themselves. But thankfully my mother was not one of those kind. And she – well I always thought of her as an educated person which she was because she was the only one I knew who had completed high school.

"(87, 91)",So – I guess they figured “Let's get this lady out of here because she's talking loud and long.” And they had never come up with anybody like that.

"(108, 115)","She told them that they had rented the house, she told them how much money she had paid, she had told them that was all the money she had. And they had paid that rent for a month.

And now I'm telling you that we're going to be here for a month. So you might just as well make up your mind to that. If you don't want me here then you people get together and give me enough money to move somewhere else, because I do not have it.”","She said it was winter, we couldn’t afford repairs, and challenged them to help if they wanted us gone"
