<p>This black family moved from a Jewish to an Irish neighbourhood. When they arrived someone stoned their windows. As the father was drunk, the narrator ran to find the Mum who they thought would know how to resolve the situation given her schooling at Lackanawny. The &#x27;Mom&#x27; sought and found a policeman on the street. He said he would like to help but there was nothing he could do even though, or in spite of, he was Irish too. So they went to the station on 5th and explained the situation, how they had the windows stoned, how it would make their place unbearable in the cold of winter as they had no money to fix it; the police at the station also said there was nothing they could do but did offer her a ride back in the police wagon, a wagon still driven by horses even though it was 1925. They were thankful she accepted as she talked long and hard. Clang, Clang clang went the bells as they went down the street which caused all the neighbours to come onto the street upon the wagon&#x27;s arrival to see what the fuss was about. The mother took the opportunity to explain to those gathered that she had used all the family money to pay a full months rent so she was staying the month, in these cold winter days she was, colour aside, just like them in that she wanted to put a roof over her children&#x27;s head and if the locals didn&#x27;t want them there because they were black then they&#x27;d have to provide the money for them to move on. Naturally, this didn&#x27;t happen, as likely the locals were in the same financial predicament however after this episode they became much friendlier, helping out wherever possible in times of need such as when the drunken father became ill.</p>

<p>The story was about a family that just moved into a neighborhood. They were black and they had troubles with the people in the neighborhood who were throwing rocks at their windows. The child who was left at home was scared and tried to call his mother. But she did not answer, he waited until he thought it was safe and then came out of his hiding spot. His mother got home and he told her everything that happened. They then called the police, and the police told them that they could do nothing about it. They told them because they are black and this is an Irish neighborhood, they should just move out because the circumstances won&#x27;t change. The mother was very smart from a very well known high school and told the policeman that she will not move because she does not have enough money. The police insisted on them moving. And she spent the whole time telling them that they don&#x27;t have any money. The police then offered to take them home because they were tired of her speaking, as she was the first person who actually spoke out on the situation. As they were going out, there were people surrounding them telling them that they had to move out. And they mother said that in order for them to move out all of them had to come up with enough money for a month&#x27;s rent as they had to pay for that house in advance and she does not have the money to move anywhere else. The story ends with the mother, saying that she will stay where she is and they have to accept that she is there because even if she is black, she is no different to them.</p>

<p>The day that she moved into Third and Wharton, when she was 10, her father left to return the team of horses and her mother went to do shopping on Fourth.  Some people began to throw stones through the windows of the house they had rented.  She took the other children into the stairway and told them to stay there because they would be safe from flyin&#x27; glass.  She left the house, and prayed, not knowing if they would throw things at them.  She found her mother shopping and explained what had happened.  A police officer came over and asked.  He said that the neighbourhood was bad and they were likely Irish.  He was also Irish.  He said he couldn&#x27;t do anything. Her mother asked what precinct he was from and he told her, although the narrator didn&#x27;t remember.  Likely on Fifth.  The captain was told the story and also said he couldn&#x27;t do anything because the girl didn&#x27;t see who threw the stones, and it was likely a number of people. Both the original police officer and captain suggested the family move out, because black people were not welcome there.  But her mother refused, as they didn&#x27;t have any more money, having rented the home for one month with all their money.  She told the Captain to take them home in the Police Patrol, which had a clanging bell and was pulled by horses.  As they got home a crowd had gathered.  Her mother came out the long door in the back and confronted the crowd, saying that despite being a different colour she was the same as them and was staying at least a month, couldn&#x27;t afford new windows, and if they wanted her to leave they had to give her enough money to go live somewhere else.  The crowd did not do so.  While they lived there, her father got sick, and the neighbours were very helpful and friendly.  But her welcome to the neighbourhood had been terrifying.</p>

<h2>Recall 63780dcb8171e255fe423b28</h2>
<p>It was 1925 the person who was telling the story was 10 years old. The father was a drunk. When mother (mom) went to the market on fourth street for food a stone was thrown through the window of the house they were renting. 10 year old who was looking after the kids put them in the stairwell to keep them safe while he / she went to look for the mother. Mother was found and before he/she could speak to her a policeman asked what was wrong. When he explained the policeman said it was an Irish neighbourhood and they did not like blacks and there was nothing he could do to help. The mother was not happy with the response and went to the police station to ask for help. No help was given however she asked to be taken home in police patrol wagon with horses which the police did. Bells on the horses alerted their neighbours in their street - fifth street and came out to see what was happening mother explained about the stone through the window . She explained she could not move out as she had no money as she had spent it on months rent but if they wanted the family to move they could pay their rent for somewhere else. Neighbours could not afford to do this. The father got sick and the neighbours helped the family. The 10 year old was very terrified and scared by the experience. </p>

<p>The family had recently moved house. The father wasn’t there and the mother had gone to the store when a window in the house was smashed by people in the neighbourhood. Even though the narrator was scared at what they would find outside, they left the house and tracked down the mother at the store. A policeman heard them tell what had happened and said it’s a neighbourhood of Irish people and they don’t want you there because you are black - he didn’t actually say the word black. This was in 1925 and the narrator was 10. The mother asked which precinct he worked from and they went there. She spoke to someone there who told her she was best to pack up and leave, which she couldn’t afford to do. She made them give a lift home with the police patrol and when they arrived she spoke to the crowd. She said you don’t want me here but I am paid for a month. If you want us out then you need to give us the money to go. Of course the neighbours didn’t. The mother was educated and had been to Lackawanna high school. Later then the dad was ill, the neighbours rallied round.</p>

<p>This is a story of a family that moved to a new neighbourhood and a ten year old is telling us how they were welcomed by a flock of people who threw stones in their house and broke windows. The ten year old was home alone with their young siblings whilst the mom was out to to some late night shopping in the jewish sho[s that opened until very late. The ten year old was faced with a challenge of calming their siblings down and ask them to hide ina place where they would not be hit by the stones. The ten year old later ran out to look for the mom, being careful not to be hit by the stones. They finally found the mom in the jewish stores and let her know what was happening. Whilst the ten year old was trying to tell their mom, they coul not breath or even utter the words properly because due to being frightened. There were police patrollers around who kind od understood what the ten year old was trying to say and they warned the mom about the are. The advised her to move to another area, as that area was not &quot;good for them&quot;, and according to them people like them(blacks) were not welcomed in the area. The mother told the patol that there&#x27;s no way that they can move because they had just moved in and paid rent, ad the people took their money.
