She is lovely and pretty. But when she opens her mouth she becomes unattractive, she talks too much. Goodness, she is a chatter box. One day she decided to run away, because of her chief police father scolding her all the time. He came to me after she left and demanded I search for her. I said I'll do what I can and then if we can't find her you can do whatever you feel is right. We looked in a park where we last found her scarf and then nothing. We returned to a police station, and there she was, holding a book in her hand. The officer there told me I better transfer because that old man never forgets a thing. I already transferred and that was the end of my rookie year."
