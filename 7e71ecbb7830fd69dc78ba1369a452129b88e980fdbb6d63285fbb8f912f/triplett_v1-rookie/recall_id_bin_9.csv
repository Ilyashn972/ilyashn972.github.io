His chief, named Frank Mitchell, had a daughter who was very taken with the author. But he did not return her interest, mostly because she talked too much (she was a 'chatterbox'). He tells of the time the chief showed up at his house, saying the daughter had run away because the chief always gave her a hard time over talking about the author so much. The author said he knew nothing about, was not involved, but would help find her so the chief could see the truth and act as he thought was appropriate. They found the girl's scarf in the park, but no other clues. When they went back to the police station they found the girl there, sitting reading a book. The author was advised to transfer out, because even though he did nothing wrong, the chief would still remember the incident. The author took his advice and transferred out."

He was a veteran. He had caught a notorious criminal. He had a daughter. I thought she was into me because I was into fitness. I never observed it. I wasn't much fond of her because she was a chatterbox. She wanted to run away because her dad always scolded her. Then she did. The commander came to my house with a cold look in his eyes. He wanted to know what happened to his daughter. ""Lets go look for her"", I said. I was strategizing. So, we went to the park where her scarf was found. Then, it led back to a police station, where she was sitting with a book. She had never run away, and that solved the problem for that day. That evening, a supervisor on the force, Frank Mitchell, said to me, ""You need to transfer, once that old man gets something in his head it never leaves"". So I did it. I transferred.
