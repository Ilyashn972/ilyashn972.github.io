8,Truth is I wasn't very fond of her because she was –,19.39,60.61,60.0,60.0,40.61,-0.61
9,She was a charming girl until she opened her mouth.,32.65,80.81,60.0,90.0,27.35,9.19

15,I managed to calm him down.,8.16,44.44,60.0,80.0,51.84,35.56
16,and proposed “Well we'll search for her,34.69,80.81,70.0,100.0,35.31,19.19

19,So he accepted my offer.,8.16,58.59,10.0,100.0,1.84,41.41
20,And we went to where they found her scarf – near a park.,58.16,88.89,80.0,100.0,21.84,11.11

22,and we couldn't locate her.,21.43,63.64,70.0,100.0,48.57,36.36

26,She hadn't run away.,44.9,87.88,50.0,90.0,5.1,2.12
