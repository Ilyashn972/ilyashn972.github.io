But he had – a young daughter. And in those days I was a fitness enthusiast. And it seemed she was trying to impress me. I never observed it. Truth is I wasn't very fond of her because she was – She was a charming girl until she opened her mouth. She was a chatterbox. Goodness, she could talk. Then she left a message one day saying she was going to run away because he was always scolding her about me. He arrived at my apartment. Big intimidating look on his face. I managed to calm him down. and proposed “Well we'll search for her and if we can't locate her well you can – do whatever you think is right.” I was strategizing. So he accepted my offer.

And returned – it was a police station – she was sitting on a chair with a book in her hands. She hadn't run away. But – nevertheless – that resolved the issue for that day. But that evening the deputy, Frank Mitchell, said “You better transfer and leave because that old man never forgets anything once he gets it into his mind.” And I did. I transferred. and left.
