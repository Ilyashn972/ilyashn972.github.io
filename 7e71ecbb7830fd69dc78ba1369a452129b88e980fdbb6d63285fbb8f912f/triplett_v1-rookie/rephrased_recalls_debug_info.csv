5f86ebc47c32d005ad582abd,13,and I can't remember if they actually found her.,and it's unclear to me whether they ever located her.
5f86ebc47c32d005ad582abd,14,My memory is worse than I thought.,My recollection is failing me more than I realized.
5f9e93bb62e24043c32378d7,1,"Back in the days when I was a rookie in the police force,","During my early years as a novice officer in the law enforcement agency,"
5f9e93bb62e24043c32378d7,2,the Chief was a veteran.,our Commander was an experienced hand.

5f9e93bb62e24043c32378d7,5,And in those days I was a fitness enthusiast,"At that time, I was quite devoted to physical fitness"
5f9e93bb62e24043c32378d7,6,"and it seemed she was trying to impress me,","and apparently, she seemed to want to make an impression on me,"
5f9e93bb62e24043c32378d7,7,I had never observed it.,though I had never really noticed.
5f9e93bb62e24043c32378d7,8,Truth is I wasn't very fond of them because they were.,"Honestly, I didn't have much affection for them, simply because they were."
5f9e93bb62e24043c32378d7,9,She was a charming girl until she started to speak.,The girl was delightful until she began talking.
5f9e93bb62e24043c32378d7,10,She was a chatterbox.,She could talk your ear off.
5f9e93bb62e24043c32378d7,11,And could she talk.,And talk she did.
5f9e93bb62e24043c32378d7,12,"Then she left a message one day saying that she was going to run away,","One day, she left a note declaring her intention to elope,"
5f9e93bb62e24043c32378d7,13,because she was unhappy about me.,as she was discontented with me.
5f9e93bb62e24043c32378d7,14,He arrived at my apartment.,He showed up at my residence.
5f9e93bb62e24043c32378d7,15,A big intimidating look on his face.,His expression was stern and daunting.
5f9e93bb62e24043c32378d7,16,I managed to calm him down,I succeeded in pacifying him
5f9e93bb62e24043c32378d7,17,"and suggested that ""we'll search for her and if we can't locate her well you can do whatever you think is needed""","and proposed that ""we should look for her, and if she remains unfound, then you can take any necessary action you deem appropriate"""
5f9e93bb62e24043c32378d7,18,I was strategizing.,I was plotting a course of action.
5f9e93bb62e24043c32378d7,19,So he accepted my offer.,"Thus, he agreed to my proposition."
5f9e93bb62e24043c32378d7,20,And we went to where they found her scarf near a park,We proceeded to the location where her scarf was discovered by a park
5f9e93bb62e24043c32378d7,21,and we traced it down a little more,and we followed the trail a bit further
5f9e93bb62e24043c32378d7,22,and we couldn't locate her.,yet we were unable to find her.
5f9e93bb62e24043c32378d7,23,"And returned it was a police station,","Upon returning to the precinct,"
5f9e93bb62e24043c32378d7,24,she was sitting on a chair with a book in her hands.,"there she was, perched on a seat with a tome in her grasp."
5f9e93bb62e24043c32378d7,25,"She hadn't run away,","She hadn't actually fled,"
5f9e93bb62e24043c32378d7,26,nevertheless that resolved the issue that day.,but that incident settled the matter for the day.
5f9e93bb62e24043c32378d7,27,"That evening the deputy Mitchell said "" you better transfer and leave because that old man never forgets anything once gets it in his mind""","That night, deputy Mitchell advised, ""you should consider a transfer and departure because the old man never lets go of anything once it's in his head"""
5f9e93bb62e24043c32378d7,28,"And so I did, I transferred and left.",So that's what I did; I requested a transfer and moved on.
5f9e93bb62e24043c32378d7,29,That was the end of my rookie year.,That marked the conclusion of my inaugural year on the force.

5fa154fd4cbe97227182aff7,6,because she was a chatterbox.,owing to her incessant talking.
5fa154fd4cbe97227182aff7,7,"One day, she ran away from home","On a certain occasion, she disappeared from her residence"
5fa154fd4cbe97227182aff7,8,because her father argued about me with her.,following a dispute with her father concerning me.
