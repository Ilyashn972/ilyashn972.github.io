He had the reputation of being really good at catching criminals. I at the time was one of these kind of people who liked going to the gym I liked to keep myself fit. At the time this police chief had a daughter who was sweet on me. I never liked her because she was a chatterbox and never encouraged her to be over friendly with me. One particular the chief asked me for help to look for his daughter who had run away after complaining that she was getting chastised for always talking about me. We got the whole force out looking for her and found a scarf on a bench. Eventually we carried on searching and found her reading a book under a tree. Everyone was very relieved but the deputy warned me that I better ask for a transfer because the ""old man never forgets anything"" so i put in for a transfer and that was the end of my rookie career."

The captain there was a veteran and had received commendations for bravery and for capturing a criminal. His daughter liked me. I was a fitness fanatic. But I didn't like her. She talked far too much. One day she left me a message saying that she was going to run away. As her father (my boss) was always telling her off about her infatuation with me. Her father came to my apartment that evening. And was very intimidating. But I was able to calm him down. And suggested that we team up and look for her. He agreed with this. And we started searching at a point where her scarf had been discovered. We were unsuccessful. I encouraged him to keep looking. And we headed back to the Police Station. His daughter was in there, sitting in a chair, with a book in her hand. Although that situation was resolved. I was soon warned by her father's Deputy that my boss wouldn't forget this. And would likely blame me for the situation. He (the deputy) suggested that I transfer away from that Station. I took his advice. And did so. And concluded my rookie year at another Station."

Their police chief / captain had a good reputation - had recently caught a renowned criminal. The captain had a daughter who was very 'fond' of the Rookie. She was into fitness and she was trying to interact / engage with the rookie. But he wasn't really interested - he thought she was ok until she opened her mouth and started talking as he describes her as a 'chatterbox' One day, the daughter came to the rookie and said she was running away because he (her father?) was always on her case. Later that day the police captain came knocking on the rookie's door asking for help as his daughter was missing. The rookie strategised and played the game - trying to help find the daughter and keep the captain happy. They looked for her and although found her scarf they couldn't track her down. Then, at the police station she was there, with a book in hand. She hadn't run away and was safe. Afterwards, another colleague advised him to leave as the 'captain never forgets anything'. So the Rookie did take the advice and leave, ending their first year as a rookie at that station."
