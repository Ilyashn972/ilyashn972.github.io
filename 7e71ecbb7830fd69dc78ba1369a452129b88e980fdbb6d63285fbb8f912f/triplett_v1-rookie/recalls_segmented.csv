5f4560c565e28d13e5dd5d56,9,They found the girl at the police station
5f4560c565e28d13e5dd5d56,10,busy reading a book.
5f4560c565e28d13e5dd5d56,11,The deputy officer told the rookie to stay away
5f4560c565e28d13e5dd5d56,12,from the daughter of the chief officer.
60471ddd0b6ed718cb843760,1,Back in the day
60471ddd0b6ed718cb843760,2,when he was a rookie
60471ddd0b6ed718cb843760,3,there was a lady
60471ddd0b6ed718cb843760,4,that went missing
60471ddd0b6ed718cb843760,5,only to find out
60471ddd0b6ed718cb843760,6,that she was not actually missing.
60471ddd0b6ed718cb843760,7,The detective
60471ddd0b6ed718cb843760,8,had a daughter
60471ddd0b6ed718cb843760,9,as well.
5f411693e388cd26c8000e90,1,A young rookie cop
5f411693e388cd26c8000e90,2,had trouble
5f411693e388cd26c8000e90,3,with a chief’s daughter
5f411693e388cd26c8000e90,4,who followed him.
5f411693e388cd26c8000e90,5,She was angry
5f411693e388cd26c8000e90,6,with her father
5f411693e388cd26c8000e90,7,who was always scolding her.
5f411693e388cd26c8000e90,8,She said
5f411693e388cd26c8000e90,9,she was going to run away.
5f411693e388cd26c8000e90,10,The rookie and father
5f411693e388cd26c8000e90,11,went in search
5f411693e388cd26c8000e90,12,and found her scarf.
5f411693e388cd26c8000e90,13,Eventually they went back
5f411693e388cd26c8000e90,14,to the police station
5f411693e388cd26c8000e90,15,where the girl was
5f411693e388cd26c8000e90,16,and was reading a book.
5f411693e388cd26c8000e90,17,Another officer told the rookie
5f411693e388cd26c8000e90,18,the chief would never forget
5f411693e388cd26c8000e90,19,so he had better move on.
5f411693e388cd26c8000e90,20,He did move
5f411693e388cd26c8000e90,21,and that was the end
5f411693e388cd26c8000e90,22,of his rookie year.
5d833b0e6642ee0001bfa9cb,1,working in police force
5d833b0e6642ee0001bfa9cb,2,and met a girl
5d833b0e6642ee0001bfa9cb,3,who was the chiefs daughter.
5d833b0e6642ee0001bfa9cb,4,he didnt like her
5d833b0e6642ee0001bfa9cb,5,as she had a big mouth.
5ea2c41d59f5e906e5eea326,1,Back in the days when he was a rookie police officer
5ea2c41d59f5e906e5eea326,2,he worked under a chief who was a veteran.
5ea2c41d59f5e906e5eea326,3,The veteran had a young daughter
5ea2c41d59f5e906e5eea326,4,who became obsessed with the rookie police officer.
5ea2c41d59f5e906e5eea326,5,The rookie didn’t like her much
5ea2c41d59f5e906e5eea326,6,because she talked too much.
5ea2c41d59f5e906e5eea326,7,The daughter was always scolded by her dad
5ea2c41d59f5e906e5eea326,8,for always talking to and obsessing over the rookie
5ea2c41d59f5e906e5eea326,9,so she sent the rookie a message saying she was going to run away.
5ea2c41d59f5e906e5eea326,10,The rookie spoke to his chief about finding her
5ea2c41d59f5e906e5eea326,11,"and said he would help,"
5ea2c41d59f5e906e5eea326,12,chief accepted
5ea2c41d59f5e906e5eea326,13,and they traced her to a park
5ea2c41d59f5e906e5eea326,14,where they found her scarf.
5ea2c41d59f5e906e5eea326,15,But in the end it turns out she didn’t run away
5ea2c41d59f5e906e5eea326,16,and was found with a book in her hands.
5ea2c41d59f5e906e5eea326,17,A fellow officer told the rookie he should transfer
5ea2c41d59f5e906e5eea326,18,because of all of the issues
5ea2c41d59f5e906e5eea326,19,and the rookie agreed
5ea2c41d59f5e906e5eea326,20,and transferred.
604637ce7d3ec8090f32cbed,1,Back in the day.
604637ce7d3ec8090f32cbed,2,There was a guy who was a rookie at a police station.
604637ce7d3ec8090f32cbed,3,The captain had a daughter that liked this new rookie.
604637ce7d3ec8090f32cbed,4,"Well, he was a gym enthusiast."
604637ce7d3ec8090f32cbed,5,But he never quite liked the girl.
604637ce7d3ec8090f32cbed,6,She looked good until she opened her mouth.
604637ce7d3ec8090f32cbed,7,She was quite the chatterbox and she never kept quiet.
604637ce7d3ec8090f32cbed,8,She said she would run away if he doesn't give her a chance.
604637ce7d3ec8090f32cbed,9,And really one time she disappeared and the captain came looking for her at his place.
604637ce7d3ec8090f32cbed,10,He promised to do harm to him if he doesn't find her.
604637ce7d3ec8090f32cbed,11,He had a plan of where to look this was to distract him.
604637ce7d3ec8090f32cbed,12,They found her scarf and not her.
604637ce7d3ec8090f32cbed,13,"Only to find her at the station on a chair, reading a book."
604637ce7d3ec8090f32cbed,14,He was warned to lay low or disappear because the captain never forgets.
604637ce7d3ec8090f32cbed,15,Then he transferred to another station.
5fc4cb35621804962c7d21df,1,The narrator was a rookie in a police station
5fc4cb35621804962c7d21df,2,and the chief was a veteran.
5fc4cb35621804962c7d21df,3,He had a daughter
5fc4cb35621804962c7d21df,4,"who was a real chatterbox,"
5fc4cb35621804962c7d21df,5,could talk a lot anyway
5fc4cb35621804962c7d21df,6,she took a shine to the rookie
5fc4cb35621804962c7d21df,7,and they were not too keen.
5fc4cb35621804962c7d21df,8,"She told the rookie that her father was not ok with her interest in the rookie,"
5fc4cb35621804962c7d21df,9,she threatened to run away.
5fc4cb35621804962c7d21df,10,The veteran went to the rookies house
5fc4cb35621804962c7d21df,11,"and when the rookie offered to help look for her,"
5fc4cb35621804962c7d21df,12,he seemed ok with this.
5fc4cb35621804962c7d21df,13,"They searched for her,"
5fc4cb35621804962c7d21df,14,found a scarf
5fc4cb35621804962c7d21df,15,and then went to the police station
5fc4cb35621804962c7d21df,16,to find her sitting there reading a book.
5fc4cb35621804962c7d21df,17,Another officer advised the rookie to transfer
5fc4cb35621804962c7d21df,18,"as the veteran never forgets,"
5fc4cb35621804962c7d21df,19,so they moved
5fc4cb35621804962c7d21df,20,and that was the end of the rookies time.
601882967b43c4142c33867c,1,The narrator was a rookie police officer.
601882967b43c4142c33867c,2,The chief of police at his station was an angry man with a daughter.
601882967b43c4142c33867c,3,The daughter was enamoured by the rookie police officer.
601882967b43c4142c33867c,4,Although he thought her to be a chatter box.
601882967b43c4142c33867c,5,She told him that if he didn't reciprocate then she would run away.
601882967b43c4142c33867c,6,Which she did.
601882967b43c4142c33867c,7,The police chief blamed the rookie.
601882967b43c4142c33867c,8,Although they teamed up to find the girl.
601882967b43c4142c33867c,9,They found her at the police station with a book in her hand.
601882967b43c4142c33867c,10,On his next shift the rookie was advised to transfer station.
601882967b43c4142c33867c,11,Because the chief was an angry man that never forgets.
601882967b43c4142c33867c,12,And he blamed the rookie for his daughter's behaviour.
601882967b43c4142c33867c,13,So the rookie did just that.
601882967b43c4142c33867c,14,And that was the end of his rookie career.
5f86ebc47c32d005ad582abd,1,"There was a Policeman,"
5f86ebc47c32d005ad582abd,2,a good one
5f86ebc47c32d005ad582abd,3,but he hadn't won a medal or award for bravery.
5f86ebc47c32d005ad582abd,4,HE had a daughter
5f86ebc47c32d005ad582abd,5,whom the writer really liked.
5f86ebc47c32d005ad582abd,6,"She was witty, intelligent and beautiful (or words to that effect)."
5f86ebc47c32d005ad582abd,7,The Policeman didn't want the writer to be friends
5f86ebc47c32d005ad582abd,8,or have a relationship with the daughter.
5f86ebc47c32d005ad582abd,9,She went missing one day.
5f86ebc47c32d005ad582abd,10,The writer proposed he would look for her.
5f86ebc47c32d005ad582abd,11,Maybe the Policeman went too.
5f86ebc47c32d005ad582abd,12,They found a scarf belonging to her
5f86ebc47c32d005ad582abd,13,and I can't remember if they actually found her.
5f86ebc47c32d005ad582abd,14,My memory is worse than I thought.
612c0ddf54ad4f6744e875b7,1,"Back in the days,"
612c0ddf54ad4f6744e875b7,2,I was a rookie in the police force.
612c0ddf54ad4f6744e875b7,3,The chief was something.
612c0ddf54ad4f6744e875b7,4,I was a fitness enthusiast.
612c0ddf54ad4f6744e875b7,5,He has a daughter
612c0ddf54ad4f6744e875b7,6,who was talking to me.
612c0ddf54ad4f6744e875b7,7,She was a charmer
612c0ddf54ad4f6744e875b7,8,until she opened her mouth.
612c0ddf54ad4f6744e875b7,9,Then she ran away.
612c0ddf54ad4f6744e875b7,10,The superintendent came to my house
612c0ddf54ad4f6744e875b7,11,with an intimidating look.
612c0ddf54ad4f6744e875b7,12,We decided to look for her
612c0ddf54ad4f6744e875b7,13,and found her scarf at a park
612c0ddf54ad4f6744e875b7,14,but not her.
612c0ddf54ad4f6744e875b7,15,Then we found her at a police station
612c0ddf54ad4f6744e875b7,16,reading a book.
612c0ddf54ad4f6744e875b7,17,She hadn’t run away.
612c0ddf54ad4f6744e875b7,18,Someone at the station told me
612c0ddf54ad4f6744e875b7,19,I should leave
612c0ddf54ad4f6744e875b7,20,as he didn’t forget anything.
612c0ddf54ad4f6744e875b7,21,So I did.
612c0ddf54ad4f6744e875b7,22,That was the end of my rookie year.
5fbaf990efe4a5bcf223f9d7,1,a girl was a rookie
5fbaf990efe4a5bcf223f9d7,2,and had an argument with a boss gf
5fbaf990efe4a5bcf223f9d7,3,and the girlfriend disappeared
5fbaf990efe4a5bcf223f9d7,4,"but at the end they found,"
5fbaf990efe4a5bcf223f9d7,5,the rookie girl had to transfer
5fbaf990efe4a5bcf223f9d7,6,because the boss did not forget easily.
5b52fb6cb3c9400001f23bb5,1,A rookie in the police
5b52fb6cb3c9400001f23bb5,2,This is a story about his first year in the force.
5b52fb6cb3c9400001f23bb5,3,He had a boss who was a veteran.
5b52fb6cb3c9400001f23bb5,4,His boss had a young daughter
5b52fb6cb3c9400001f23bb5,5,Who it seems had a thing for the rookie
5b52fb6cb3c9400001f23bb5,6,As he was a fitness enthusiast.
5b52fb6cb3c9400001f23bb5,7,When the boss's daughter went missing
5b52fb6cb3c9400001f23bb5,8,The boss thought that the rookie had something to do with it
5b52fb6cb3c9400001f23bb5,9,And went to the rookie's apartment looking for the boss's daughter.
5b52fb6cb3c9400001f23bb5,10,She wasn't there
5b52fb6cb3c9400001f23bb5,11,So the rookie helped the boss look for his daughter.
5b52fb6cb3c9400001f23bb5,12,They found her scarf near a park
5b52fb6cb3c9400001f23bb5,13,And eventually located her at the police station reading a book.
5b52fb6cb3c9400001f23bb5,14,The rookie's manager Frank Mitchell advised the rookie to transfer
5b52fb6cb3c9400001f23bb5,15,As the boss never forgot anything
5b52fb6cb3c9400001f23bb5,16,And the rookie would always have trouble if he stayed.
5b52fb6cb3c9400001f23bb5,17,The rookie took the advice and transferred.
60ef0945a694c106c9e47ca2,1,A man was in his first year (rookie year) as a police officer.
60ef0945a694c106c9e47ca2,2,The Chief's daughter was interested in him.
60ef0945a694c106c9e47ca2,3,He didn't really like her.
60ef0945a694c106c9e47ca2,4,He thought she talked too much.
60ef0945a694c106c9e47ca2,5,The daughter gave him a note.
60ef0945a694c106c9e47ca2,6,The note told him that she would run away.
60ef0945a694c106c9e47ca2,7,Her Dad was scolding her about him.
60ef0945a694c106c9e47ca2,8,"Later, the daughter was lost."
60ef0945a694c106c9e47ca2,9,The Chief confronted the man.
60ef0945a694c106c9e47ca2,10,The man offered to help search for her.
60ef0945a694c106c9e47ca2,11,They found her scarf.
60ef0945a694c106c9e47ca2,12,They couldn't find her.
60ef0945a694c106c9e47ca2,13,"When they returned to the police station, they found her there."
60ef0945a694c106c9e47ca2,14,The man was told that the Chief suspected something.
60ef0945a694c106c9e47ca2,15,"Once he had something in his head, he wouldn't let it go."
5cb4c4ac0f6de500010beda7,1,I was rookie police officer
5cb4c4ac0f6de500010beda7,2,and the chief had a daughter.
5cb4c4ac0f6de500010beda7,3,She was a chatterbox.
5cb4c4ac0f6de500010beda7,4,She ran away
5cb4c4ac0f6de500010beda7,5,and we found her scarf near the police station.
5cb4c4ac0f6de500010beda7,6,"Then we found her with a book in her hands,"
5cb4c4ac0f6de500010beda7,7,she had not run away.
5cb4c4ac0f6de500010beda7,8,That was the end of my rookie days.
5b3f93fc1388aa0001a80aaf,1,When I was a rookie police officer
5b3f93fc1388aa0001a80aaf,2,the chief was a veteran.
5b3f93fc1388aa0001a80aaf,3,He had caught an important criminal
5b3f93fc1388aa0001a80aaf,4,and won an award.
5b3f93fc1388aa0001a80aaf,5,Back then I was a fitness enthusiast.
5b3f93fc1388aa0001a80aaf,6,He had a daughter
5b3f93fc1388aa0001a80aaf,7,who showed an interest in me
5b3f93fc1388aa0001a80aaf,8,but I hadn't noticed.
5b3f93fc1388aa0001a80aaf,9,She was a charming girl
5b3f93fc1388aa0001a80aaf,10,until she opened her mouth.
5b3f93fc1388aa0001a80aaf,11,She was a chatterbox.
5b3f93fc1388aa0001a80aaf,12,Goodness she could talk.
5b3f93fc1388aa0001a80aaf,13,One day she had left a note
5b3f93fc1388aa0001a80aaf,14,saying she was going to run away
5b3f93fc1388aa0001a80aaf,15,because he was always scolding her.
5b3f93fc1388aa0001a80aaf,16,He came to my apartment
5b3f93fc1388aa0001a80aaf,17,big intimidating look on his face.
5b3f93fc1388aa0001a80aaf,18,I said I would help to look for her
5b3f93fc1388aa0001a80aaf,19,but then he could do what he feels is right.
5b3f93fc1388aa0001a80aaf,20,I was strategizing.
5b3f93fc1388aa0001a80aaf,21,"We looked where we thought she would go,"
5b3f93fc1388aa0001a80aaf,22,by the park
5b3f93fc1388aa0001a80aaf,23,and found her scarf.
5b3f93fc1388aa0001a80aaf,24,But then we couldn't find a trace.
5b3f93fc1388aa0001a80aaf,25,We turned
5b3f93fc1388aa0001a80aaf,26,and she was in the police station reading a book.
5b3f93fc1388aa0001a80aaf,27,She hadn't run away.
5b3f93fc1388aa0001a80aaf,28,Another officer told me
5b3f93fc1388aa0001a80aaf,29,you had better transfer
5b3f93fc1388aa0001a80aaf,30,"because he never forgets anything once he has it in his mind,"
5b3f93fc1388aa0001a80aaf,31,"and I did,"
5b3f93fc1388aa0001a80aaf,32,I transferred.
5b3f93fc1388aa0001a80aaf,33,And that was the end of my rookie year.
571a82d06a1c6300094c6a19,1,When I started as a rookie policeman
571a82d06a1c6300094c6a19,2,I was introduced to my boss
571a82d06a1c6300094c6a19,3,who happened to be a war veteran.
571a82d06a1c6300094c6a19,4,He had the reputation of being really good at catching criminals.
571a82d06a1c6300094c6a19,5,I at the time was one of these kind of people who liked going to the gym
571a82d06a1c6300094c6a19,6,I liked to keep myself fit.
571a82d06a1c6300094c6a19,7,At the time this police chief had a daughter
571a82d06a1c6300094c6a19,8,who was sweet on me.
571a82d06a1c6300094c6a19,9,I never liked her
571a82d06a1c6300094c6a19,10,because she was a chatterbox
571a82d06a1c6300094c6a19,11,and never encouraged her to be over friendly with me.
571a82d06a1c6300094c6a19,12,One particular the chief asked me for help
571a82d06a1c6300094c6a19,13,to look for his daughter
571a82d06a1c6300094c6a19,14,who had run away after complaining that she was getting chastised for always talking about me.
571a82d06a1c6300094c6a19,15,We got the whole force out looking for her
571a82d06a1c6300094c6a19,16,and found a scarf on a bench.
571a82d06a1c6300094c6a19,17,Eventually we carried on searching
571a82d06a1c6300094c6a19,18,and found her reading a book under a tree.
571a82d06a1c6300094c6a19,19,Everyone was very relieved
571a82d06a1c6300094c6a19,20,but the deputy warned me
571a82d06a1c6300094c6a19,21,that I better ask for a transfer
571a82d06a1c6300094c6a19,22,"because the ""old man never forgets anything"""
571a82d06a1c6300094c6a19,23,so i put in for a transfer
571a82d06a1c6300094c6a19,24,and that was the end of my rookie career.
5f58ad6414fd6902d237d3f3,1,Guy worked as a rookie in the police force.
5f58ad6414fd6902d237d3f3,2,The relationship with my boss was challenging.
5f58ad6414fd6902d237d3f3,3,He had a daughter.
5f58ad6414fd6902d237d3f3,4,I think she had a crush on me.
5f58ad6414fd6902d237d3f3,5,She wanted us to run away together.
5f58ad6414fd6902d237d3f3,6,She was not my type at all.
5f58ad6414fd6902d237d3f3,7,One day the boss found out.
5f58ad6414fd6902d237d3f3,8,He scolded her.
5f58ad6414fd6902d237d3f3,9,She said he always did this.
5f58ad6414fd6902d237d3f3,10,She then ran away.
5f58ad6414fd6902d237d3f3,11,The boss was frantic.
5f58ad6414fd6902d237d3f3,12,We looked for her.
5f58ad6414fd6902d237d3f3,13,We could not find her.
5f58ad6414fd6902d237d3f3,14,"When we got back to the police station, she was sitting in a chair."
5f58ad6414fd6902d237d3f3,15,She was unharmed.
5f58ad6414fd6902d237d3f3,16,I was told by a colleague that I should ask for a transfer.
5f58ad6414fd6902d237d3f3,17,"The ""boss never forgets""."
5f58ad6414fd6902d237d3f3,18,He did this.
5f58ad6414fd6902d237d3f3,19,He was transferred.
5f58ad6414fd6902d237d3f3,20,That was his rookie year.
5f702dfd68dfbf000da79ada,1,"Back in the day when he was in the police force,"
5f702dfd68dfbf000da79ada,2,"during his rookie year,"
5f702dfd68dfbf000da79ada,3,he tried to explain an incident
5f702dfd68dfbf000da79ada,4,about locating a charming and missing lady
5f702dfd68dfbf000da79ada,5,through a scarf
5f702dfd68dfbf000da79ada,6,that was probably by the river.
6483247637d20bcecd41963b,1,"Back in the day when I was a rookie,"
6483247637d20bcecd41963b,2,"I was a veteran,"
6483247637d20bcecd41963b,3,I was into fitness.
6483247637d20bcecd41963b,4,"I caught the attention of a young girl,"
6483247637d20bcecd41963b,5,"I think she was trying to impress me,"
6483247637d20bcecd41963b,6,"I found her friendly,"
6483247637d20bcecd41963b,7,but my word she could talk!
6483247637d20bcecd41963b,8,She said she will run away one day because she was sick and tired of all the nagging.
6483247637d20bcecd41963b,9,"The young girl went missing one day,"
6483247637d20bcecd41963b,10,"so we went to her fathers house,"
6483247637d20bcecd41963b,11,"he was a big man,"
6483247637d20bcecd41963b,12,"he said you might find her in the park,"
6483247637d20bcecd41963b,13,we found her scarf on the bench.
6483247637d20bcecd41963b,14,"I went back to the station and met deputy Frank Mitchell,"
6483247637d20bcecd41963b,15,"it was there where we found the young girl at the state reading a book,"
6483247637d20bcecd41963b,16,she hadn't ran away at all.
6483247637d20bcecd41963b,17,That was the end of my rookie year.
641f24898edfbdc7328d686e,1,Rookie and a chief
641f24898edfbdc7328d686e,2,who caught a criminal
641f24898edfbdc7328d686e,3,that had a daughter.
641f24898edfbdc7328d686e,4,She tried to impress the rookie
641f24898edfbdc7328d686e,5,but he didn't like her
641f24898edfbdc7328d686e,6,because she was a chatterbox.
641f24898edfbdc7328d686e,7,She ran away one day
641f24898edfbdc7328d686e,8,and the chief and the rookie went looking for her.
641f24898edfbdc7328d686e,9,They found her scarf near a park
641f24898edfbdc7328d686e,10,but didn't find her
641f24898edfbdc7328d686e,11,until she was back at the police station with a book.
641f24898edfbdc7328d686e,12,She didn't run away.
641f24898edfbdc7328d686e,13,The rookie left the station.
57a7337e913c710001977341,1,Rookie policeman got close to the chief’s daughter.
57a7337e913c710001977341,2,She looked nice
57a7337e913c710001977341,3,but was a chatterbox.
57a7337e913c710001977341,4,One day she said she was going to run away
57a7337e913c710001977341,5,but didn’t
57a7337e913c710001977341,6,and ended up at a police station
57a7337e913c710001977341,7,after the rookie and her dad went looking for her.
57a7337e913c710001977341,8,They were relieved
57a7337e913c710001977341,9,as they only found her scarf in the park.
57a7337e913c710001977341,10,After she was found
57a7337e913c710001977341,11,the rookie felt all was well
57a7337e913c710001977341,12,but another more experienced policeman said he should leave
57a7337e913c710001977341,13,as it seems the chief blamed him
57a7337e913c710001977341,14,and never forgot anyone who upset his daughter
57a7337e913c710001977341,15,so the rookie transferred.
598d55aa8380cc00012a3a53,1,A young girl
598d55aa8380cc00012a3a53,2,who is infatuated with a fit young police officer
598d55aa8380cc00012a3a53,3,has apparently run away.
598d55aa8380cc00012a3a53,4,"Her father,"
598d55aa8380cc00012a3a53,5,"who is the young officer’s superior,"
598d55aa8380cc00012a3a53,6,goes to challenge him.
598d55aa8380cc00012a3a53,7,"They search for her together,"
598d55aa8380cc00012a3a53,8,but she is found waiting at the police station.
598d55aa8380cc00012a3a53,9,"Fearful of further trouble,"
598d55aa8380cc00012a3a53,10,the rookie officer transfers out.
614618f3146cc85f803c4e69,1,This guy was a rookie police officer
614618f3146cc85f803c4e69,2,and his boss was a veteran.
614618f3146cc85f803c4e69,3,He had a daughter
614618f3146cc85f803c4e69,4,and the rookie thought this girl liked him
614618f3146cc85f803c4e69,5,and her father didn’t really approve.
614618f3146cc85f803c4e69,6,One day she went missing
614618f3146cc85f803c4e69,7,"and the rookie helped her father look for her,"
614618f3146cc85f803c4e69,8,they couldn’t find her despite finding her scarf.
614618f3146cc85f803c4e69,9,They returned to the police station
614618f3146cc85f803c4e69,10,and saw her sat there reading a book.
614618f3146cc85f803c4e69,11,Another police officer there called Frank Mitchell
614618f3146cc85f803c4e69,12,suggested to the rookie that he change his career path
614618f3146cc85f803c4e69,13,"and switch away from that particular police station,"
614618f3146cc85f803c4e69,14,which he did.
6146f8473af59b2f858aa2f2,1,back in the days when I was a rookie
6146f8473af59b2f858aa2f2,2,the chief was rewarded for bravery.
6146f8473af59b2f858aa2f2,3,I was into fitness
6146f8473af59b2f858aa2f2,4,and there was a girl
6146f8473af59b2f858aa2f2,5,"but she was a chatterbox,"
6146f8473af59b2f858aa2f2,6,something was off about him
6146f8473af59b2f858aa2f2,7,and one day she went missing
6146f8473af59b2f858aa2f2,8,and he came over
6146f8473af59b2f858aa2f2,9,"and I agreed to go look for her,"
6146f8473af59b2f858aa2f2,10,"we found her cardigan,"
6146f8473af59b2f858aa2f2,11,we carried on looking.
6146f8473af59b2f858aa2f2,12,I was advised to transfer
6146f8473af59b2f858aa2f2,13,"as he would never forget,"
6146f8473af59b2f858aa2f2,14,so I did.
63ef566e5460d50a368654dd,1,The narrator was a rookie cop.
63ef566e5460d50a368654dd,2,It was his first year.
63ef566e5460d50a368654dd,3,His superior caught a big criminal or won an award.
63ef566e5460d50a368654dd,4,His superior had a daughter.
63ef566e5460d50a368654dd,5,The daughter fancied the rookie cop.
63ef566e5460d50a368654dd,6,He didn't like her.
63ef566e5460d50a368654dd,7,She talked too much.
63ef566e5460d50a368654dd,8,One day the daughter said she was going to run away.
63ef566e5460d50a368654dd,9,The superior turned up at the rookie's house looking for his daughter.
63ef566e5460d50a368654dd,10,The rookie invited him in and invited him to look for his daughter.
63ef566e5460d50a368654dd,11,The rookie was strategising.
63ef566e5460d50a368654dd,12,The daughter wasn't in the house so they looked for her outside the house.
63ef566e5460d50a368654dd,13,They found her scarf but she was no-where to be found.
63ef566e5460d50a368654dd,14,When they both went back to the police station the daughter was sitting on the steps outside and she was reading a book.
63ef566e5460d50a368654dd,15,That was the rookie's first year as a cop.
6278d8237bb2ba9e1f2006f4,1,"In my rookie year,"
6278d8237bb2ba9e1f2006f4,2,"I was a police chief,"
6278d8237bb2ba9e1f2006f4,3,and there was a girl that went missing.
6278d8237bb2ba9e1f2006f4,4,I went to visit her father
6278d8237bb2ba9e1f2006f4,5,and he said she was -
6278d8237bb2ba9e1f2006f4,6,she was always chatting.
6278d8237bb2ba9e1f2006f4,7,She was a chatterbox.
6278d8237bb2ba9e1f2006f4,8,I spoke to Frank Mitchell on the phone
6278d8237bb2ba9e1f2006f4,9,and he told me to come down to the police station
6278d8237bb2ba9e1f2006f4,10,"and she was there,"
6278d8237bb2ba9e1f2006f4,11,"sitting on a chair,"
6278d8237bb2ba9e1f2006f4,12,reading a book.
6278d8237bb2ba9e1f2006f4,13,She wasn't missing.
6278d8237bb2ba9e1f2006f4,14,But - nevertheless -
6278d8237bb2ba9e1f2006f4,15,she was wearing the scarf.
6278d8237bb2ba9e1f2006f4,16,And that was the story of my rookie year.
607f2e7133afa07084f6be01,1,"In my rookie year,"
607f2e7133afa07084f6be01,2,there was a chief.
607f2e7133afa07084f6be01,3,He was stern.
607f2e7133afa07084f6be01,4,I was a fitness enthusiast
607f2e7133afa07084f6be01,5,and he had a daughter.
607f2e7133afa07084f6be01,6,She was interested in me
607f2e7133afa07084f6be01,7,and I wasn't.
607f2e7133afa07084f6be01,8,"She was a nice girl,"
607f2e7133afa07084f6be01,9,but when she opened her mouth...
607f2e7133afa07084f6be01,10,She ran away one day
607f2e7133afa07084f6be01,11,because she said her father was always scolding her because of me.
607f2e7133afa07084f6be01,12,He came to mine
607f2e7133afa07084f6be01,13,and asked me about it.
607f2e7133afa07084f6be01,14,I told him I'd help him look for her
607f2e7133afa07084f6be01,15,"and if we couldn't find her,"
607f2e7133afa07084f6be01,16,he could do whatever he wanted.
607f2e7133afa07084f6be01,17,I was strategizing.
607f2e7133afa07084f6be01,18,"We found her scarf by a park,"
607f2e7133afa07084f6be01,19,but we couldn't find her.
607f2e7133afa07084f6be01,20,we returned to the police station
607f2e7133afa07084f6be01,21,and she was sitting there with a book in her hand.
607f2e7133afa07084f6be01,22,A colleague of mine told me to transfer
607f2e7133afa07084f6be01,23,"because when the old man gets something in his head,"
607f2e7133afa07084f6be01,24,that's all he thinks about.
607f2e7133afa07084f6be01,25,So I transferred.
60b60d84e30ac4a5e926b7ca,1,"Back in the days when I was a rookie cop,"
60b60d84e30ac4a5e926b7ca,2,the chief caught a notorious criminal.
60b60d84e30ac4a5e926b7ca,3,He had a young daughter.
60b60d84e30ac4a5e926b7ca,4,In those days I loved fitness.
60b60d84e30ac4a5e926b7ca,5,She tried to impress me
60b60d84e30ac4a5e926b7ca,6,but I never observed it.
60b60d84e30ac4a5e926b7ca,7,I didnt like her
60b60d84e30ac4a5e926b7ca,8,as she was a chatterbox
60b60d84e30ac4a5e926b7ca,9,but she was charming.
60b60d84e30ac4a5e926b7ca,10,She left a message one day
60b60d84e30ac4a5e926b7ca,11,saying she was going to run away.
60b60d84e30ac4a5e926b7ca,12,The chief came to my apartment very angry
60b60d84e30ac4a5e926b7ca,13,but I calmed him down.
60b60d84e30ac4a5e926b7ca,14,We went to look for her
60b60d84e30ac4a5e926b7ca,15,and found her at the police station reading a book.
63d69163ecd60f16ced6c9c4,1,I was a rookie in the police department.
63d69163ecd60f16ced6c9c4,2,Frank was a veteran.
63d69163ecd60f16ced6c9c4,3,He had helped to capture notorious criminals.
63d69163ecd60f16ced6c9c4,4,I was a fitness enthusiast.
63d69163ecd60f16ced6c9c4,5,Frank had a daughter.
63d69163ecd60f16ced6c9c4,6,She was a chatterbox.
63d69163ecd60f16ced6c9c4,7,One day Frank's daughter told me she was going to run away.
63d69163ecd60f16ced6c9c4,8,Because he always scolded her over me.
63d69163ecd60f16ced6c9c4,9,Frank came over to my place looking mean.
63d69163ecd60f16ced6c9c4,10,We checked the park.
63d69163ecd60f16ced6c9c4,11,We found her sitting in the police station.
63d69163ecd60f16ced6c9c4,12,I left and transferred to another department.
5ff20cdfa4feb069a2164a6d,1,there was a rookie
5ff20cdfa4feb069a2164a6d,2,and his boss got a medal for bravery.
5ff20cdfa4feb069a2164a6d,3,"he had a daughter,"
5ff20cdfa4feb069a2164a6d,4,who was a fitness trainer
5ff20cdfa4feb069a2164a6d,5,but was also a chatterbox.
5ff20cdfa4feb069a2164a6d,6,she went missing
5ff20cdfa4feb069a2164a6d,7,and then they went to the park to find her
5ff20cdfa4feb069a2164a6d,8,but they found her scarf on a park bench.
5ff20cdfa4feb069a2164a6d,9,back at the station
5ff20cdfa4feb069a2164a6d,10,she was sitting in a chair reading a book.
5ff20cdfa4feb069a2164a6d,11,the rookie transferred
5ff20cdfa4feb069a2164a6d,12,and this ended his rookie year.
637a107251feecf07028be82,1,I joined the police as a rookie.
637a107251feecf07028be82,2,My chief was a veteran and had won awards.
637a107251feecf07028be82,3,I was a fitness enthusiast at the time and his daughter was interested in me.
637a107251feecf07028be82,4,I did not like her as she was a chatterbox.
637a107251feecf07028be82,5,One day she went missing and the chief came to my apartment to confront me.
637a107251feecf07028be82,6,I decided to strategise and said we could go and look for her and if we couldn't find her he could do what he wanted.
637a107251feecf07028be82,7,This seemed to placate him.
637a107251feecf07028be82,8,We went to where her scarf was found but she was not there.
637a107251feecf07028be82,9,We looked further down but no sign of her.
637a107251feecf07028be82,10,Back in the police station she was sat there reading a book.
637a107251feecf07028be82,11,"One of my colleagues, Frank Mitchell said to me I should look to go elsewhere as the chief never forgot anything."
637a107251feecf07028be82,12,I did leave.
637a107251feecf07028be82,13,That was my first year as a rookie.
6147bf640c9ef22842249bae,1,"Back in the days when he was a rookie police officer,"
6147bf640c9ef22842249bae,2,his Chief was a veteran
6147bf640c9ef22842249bae,3,and had been awarded for catching a big criminal.
6147bf640c9ef22842249bae,4,He had a daughter
6147bf640c9ef22842249bae,5,"that was very chatty,"
6147bf640c9ef22842249bae,6,and who was interested in him.
6147bf640c9ef22842249bae,7,"She one day appeared to run away,"
6147bf640c9ef22842249bae,8,because her dad would scold her for her relationship with the rookie.
6147bf640c9ef22842249bae,9,"The chief blamed the rookie,"
6147bf640c9ef22842249bae,10,they searched for her together
6147bf640c9ef22842249bae,11,where her scarf had been found.
6147bf640c9ef22842249bae,12,She was found later
6147bf640c9ef22842249bae,13,to be sitting in the police station
6147bf640c9ef22842249bae,14,reading a book.
6147bf640c9ef22842249bae,15,A colleague told him he should transfer
6147bf640c9ef22842249bae,16,because the chief would never forget.
6147bf640c9ef22842249bae,17,So he did.
5f588f227723ca000cc5e08f,1,The story is about a Rockie officer
5f588f227723ca000cc5e08f,2,"whose chief was a veteran,"
5f588f227723ca000cc5e08f,3,The chief was popular
5f588f227723ca000cc5e08f,4,and a notorious criminal.
5f588f227723ca000cc5e08f,5,The chief had a daughter
5f588f227723ca000cc5e08f,6,who was a gym enthusiast
5f588f227723ca000cc5e08f,7,and the boyfriend referred to her as a chatterbox.
5f588f227723ca000cc5e08f,8,The girl wrote a note
5f588f227723ca000cc5e08f,9,saying she was leaving
5f588f227723ca000cc5e08f,10,because she was tired of her father scowling about her boyfriend Rockie.
5f588f227723ca000cc5e08f,11,The Rockie took a transfer
5f588f227723ca000cc5e08f,12,because he was scared of the chief.
5f588f227723ca000cc5e08f,13,That was the end of his Rockie years.
5c3f18cf105d550001417ef0,1,There was a rookie in the police
5c3f18cf105d550001417ef0,2,and also a senior veteran.
5c3f18cf105d550001417ef0,3,The daughter of the veteran liked the rookie
5c3f18cf105d550001417ef0,4,but he thought she was a chatterbox
5c3f18cf105d550001417ef0,5,and was not interested.
5c3f18cf105d550001417ef0,6,She told him her father always scolded her about him
5c3f18cf105d550001417ef0,7,so she was going to run away.
5c3f18cf105d550001417ef0,8,The rookie and veteran went looking
5c3f18cf105d550001417ef0,9,and found her shaft
5c3f18cf105d550001417ef0,10,but not her.
5c3f18cf105d550001417ef0,11,They returned to the police station
5c3f18cf105d550001417ef0,12,and she was there reading a book.
5c3f18cf105d550001417ef0,13,The deputy said I should move
5c3f18cf105d550001417ef0,14,the boss doesn't forget things
5c3f18cf105d550001417ef0,15,so that was the end of the rookie's time there.
613e6364893dc0edb5e84806,1,"Back when I was a rookie,"
613e6364893dc0edb5e84806,2,the Chief was a veteran.
613e6364893dc0edb5e84806,3,He had a daughter
613e6364893dc0edb5e84806,4,who was a chatterbox.
613e6364893dc0edb5e84806,5,She ran away
613e6364893dc0edb5e84806,6,because he was always scolding her.
613e6364893dc0edb5e84806,7,They tried to find her
613e6364893dc0edb5e84806,8,but only found her scarf.
613e6364893dc0edb5e84806,9,"When they returned to the police station,"
613e6364893dc0edb5e84806,10,she was there reading a book.
613e6364893dc0edb5e84806,11,"A deputy, Frank Mitchell"
613e6364893dc0edb5e84806,12,told me to lay low
613e6364893dc0edb5e84806,13,because the chief never forgets.
5e0dd8d94cac685279492212,1,"The story is in first person,"
5e0dd8d94cac685279492212,2,about someone recalling a time they were a 'rookie' police officer in their first year on the force.
5e0dd8d94cac685279492212,3,Their police chief / captain had a good reputation -
5e0dd8d94cac685279492212,4,had recently caught a renowned criminal.
5e0dd8d94cac685279492212,5,The captain had a daughter who was very 'fond' of the Rookie.
5e0dd8d94cac685279492212,6,She was into fitness and
5e0dd8d94cac685279492212,7,she was trying to interact / engage with the rookie.
5e0dd8d94cac685279492212,8,But he wasn't really interested -
5e0dd8d94cac685279492212,9,he thought she was ok until she opened her mouth and started talking
5e0dd8d94cac685279492212,10,as he describes her as a 'chatterbox'
5e0dd8d94cac685279492212,11,"One day, the daughter came to the rookie and said she was running away"
5e0dd8d94cac685279492212,12,because he (her father?) was always on her case.
5e0dd8d94cac685279492212,13,Later that day the police captain came knocking on the rookie's door asking for help
5e0dd8d94cac685279492212,14,as his daughter was missing.
5e0dd8d94cac685279492212,15,The rookie strategised and played the game -
5e0dd8d94cac685279492212,16,trying to help find the daughter and keep the captain happy.
5e0dd8d94cac685279492212,17,They looked for her and
5e0dd8d94cac685279492212,18,although found her scarf they couldn't track her down.
5e0dd8d94cac685279492212,19,"Then, at the police station she was there, with a book in hand."
5e0dd8d94cac685279492212,20,She hadn't run away and was safe.
5e0dd8d94cac685279492212,21,"Afterwards, another colleague advised him to leave"
5e0dd8d94cac685279492212,22,as the 'captain never forgets anything'.
5e0dd8d94cac685279492212,23,"So the Rookie did take the advice and leave,"
5e0dd8d94cac685279492212,24,ending their first year as a rookie at that station.
6160588519c2aaf962da7f48,1,"Back in the day,"
6160588519c2aaf962da7f48,2,"in my rookie year,"
6160588519c2aaf962da7f48,3,I was in the police force.
6160588519c2aaf962da7f48,4,"I worked alongside the police chief,"
6160588519c2aaf962da7f48,5,he had a daughter who was a fitness enthusiast.
6160588519c2aaf962da7f48,6,"She could talk a lot,"
6160588519c2aaf962da7f48,7,always asking questions.
6160588519c2aaf962da7f48,8,One day she ran away.
6160588519c2aaf962da7f48,9,The police chief came to my door
6160588519c2aaf962da7f48,10,and asked me to look for her.
6160588519c2aaf962da7f48,11,I proposed to go out
6160588519c2aaf962da7f48,12,and look where we found her scarf.
6160588519c2aaf962da7f48,13,"It turns out she didn't run away,"
6160588519c2aaf962da7f48,14,she was at the police station reading a book.
6160588519c2aaf962da7f48,15,I was told to transfer out of my department
6160588519c2aaf962da7f48,16,as the police chief never forgets.
6160588519c2aaf962da7f48,17,And that's what I did.
610d1cf3c7b4411f1643e501,1,This is a story about a rookie police officer
610d1cf3c7b4411f1643e501,2,who had just gotten onto the force.
610d1cf3c7b4411f1643e501,3,The Chief was an veteran at his job
610d1cf3c7b4411f1643e501,4,and had just caught a notorious criminal
610d1cf3c7b4411f1643e501,5,or had been awarded for bravery.
610d1cf3c7b4411f1643e501,6,But the chief had a young daughter
610d1cf3c7b4411f1643e501,7,and the rookie police officer was a fitness enthusiast.
610d1cf3c7b4411f1643e501,8,It seemed like the chief's daughter was trying to impress the rookie.
610d1cf3c7b4411f1643e501,9,He never observed it.
610d1cf3c7b4411f1643e501,10,The truth was that he was never fond of her
610d1cf3c7b4411f1643e501,11,because she was a charming girl until she opened her mouth.
610d1cf3c7b4411f1643e501,12,She had no manners.
610d1cf3c7b4411f1643e501,13,"One day, the daughter ran away from home."
610d1cf3c7b4411f1643e501,14,"And so the Chief, with an angry look on his face"
610d1cf3c7b4411f1643e501,15,and her scarf went to the rookie police officer
610d1cf3c7b4411f1643e501,16,to ask for help to find her.
610d1cf3c7b4411f1643e501,17,"Although the rookie said if they couldn't find her,"
610d1cf3c7b4411f1643e501,18,he could go and do whatever he thinks is right. (The chief that is)
610d1cf3c7b4411f1643e501,19,They could not find her.
610d1cf3c7b4411f1643e501,20,"On the way back, they found her at the Police station, reading a book."
610d1cf3c7b4411f1643e501,21,That was the day.
610d1cf3c7b4411f1643e501,22,"However that evening, the deputy Frank Mitchell told the rookie"
610d1cf3c7b4411f1643e501,23,that he better transfer as the Chief doesn't forget anything.
610d1cf3c7b4411f1643e501,24,And so he did.
5e652bffbe3f4d000c66a42a,1,The story teller is a young rookie policeman.
5e652bffbe3f4d000c66a42a,2,His superior has a daughter.
5e652bffbe3f4d000c66a42a,3,The daughter tries to impress the storyteller.
5e652bffbe3f4d000c66a42a,4,"However, he does not like her."
5e652bffbe3f4d000c66a42a,5,This is because she is a chatterbox.
5e652bffbe3f4d000c66a42a,6,She says she will run away.
5e652bffbe3f4d000c66a42a,7,She goes missing one day.
5e652bffbe3f4d000c66a42a,8,Her father asks the rookie to help find her.
5e652bffbe3f4d000c66a42a,9,They search and find her scarf.
5e652bffbe3f4d000c66a42a,10,They go to the police station.
5e652bffbe3f4d000c66a42a,11,"She is there, reading a book."
5e652bffbe3f4d000c66a42a,12,She is not missing at all.
5e652bffbe3f4d000c66a42a,13,"The rookie is told, by another officer, to transfer."
5e652bffbe3f4d000c66a42a,14,This is because the father seems to blame him for the event.
5e652bffbe3f4d000c66a42a,15,The father will not forgive.
5e652bffbe3f4d000c66a42a,16,So he transfers.
608030a41cd2a2d7cabbba49,1,"In my first year,"
608030a41cd2a2d7cabbba49,2,I was a rookie.
608030a41cd2a2d7cabbba49,3,The detective was a veteran.
608030a41cd2a2d7cabbba49,4,He had caught a notorious criminal-
608030a41cd2a2d7cabbba49,5,or he was awarded for bravery.
608030a41cd2a2d7cabbba49,6,He had a daughter.
608030a41cd2a2d7cabbba49,7,She was a fitness instructor.
608030a41cd2a2d7cabbba49,8,She seemed to have liked me -
608030a41cd2a2d7cabbba49,9,I never observed it.
608030a41cd2a2d7cabbba49,10,I did not like for because she was -
608030a41cd2a2d7cabbba49,11,She was charming until she opened her mouth.
608030a41cd2a2d7cabbba49,12,She was a chatterbox.
608030a41cd2a2d7cabbba49,13,one day she left me a note saying she was running away because he was always scolding at her about me.
608030a41cd2a2d7cabbba49,14,He came furious to my apartment -
608030a41cd2a2d7cabbba49,15,with an intimidating look.
608030a41cd2a2d7cabbba49,16,I managed to calm him down.
608030a41cd2a2d7cabbba49,17,"I said ""Well we'll go look for her and if we can't find her -"
608030a41cd2a2d7cabbba49,18,"You can do whatever you think is right""."
608030a41cd2a2d7cabbba49,19,I was strategizing.
608030a41cd2a2d7cabbba49,20,We followed a trail of her scarf they found -
608030a41cd2a2d7cabbba49,21,near a park.
608030a41cd2a2d7cabbba49,22,She was not there -
608030a41cd2a2d7cabbba49,23,We searched a bit further but didn't find her.
608030a41cd2a2d7cabbba49,24,It was at the police station -
608030a41cd2a2d7cabbba49,25,She was sitting on a chair with a book in her hand.
608030a41cd2a2d7cabbba49,26,She didnt ran away.
608030a41cd2a2d7cabbba49,27,"the Deputy officer, Fischer said "" You should resign and leave, that man never forgets anything once he has it in his mind""."
608030a41cd2a2d7cabbba49,28,So i resigned.
608030a41cd2a2d7cabbba49,29,and left.
608030a41cd2a2d7cabbba49,30,and that was the end of my year as a rookie.
5f2b3b2b4cc04057806945da,1,"There was a rookie at a police station,"
5f2b3b2b4cc04057806945da,2,and he had a chief you enjoyed going to the gym.
5f2b3b2b4cc04057806945da,3,This chief also had a daughter
5f2b3b2b4cc04057806945da,4,"that the rookie was quite fond of,"
5f2b3b2b4cc04057806945da,5,however she was a bit of a chatterbox.
5f2b3b2b4cc04057806945da,6,"He was going to propose to her,"
5f2b3b2b4cc04057806945da,7,however it looked like she had run away.
5f2b3b2b4cc04057806945da,8,"The rookie and the chief went around looking for her,"
5f2b3b2b4cc04057806945da,9,but they couldn't find her.
5f2b3b2b4cc04057806945da,10,So they went back to the station.
5f2b3b2b4cc04057806945da,11,"However, when they got there the daughter was sat there with a book in her hands."
5f2b3b2b4cc04057806945da,12,After that the rookie left that particular station -
5f2b3b2b4cc04057806945da,13,and that was the end of his rookie year.
63b5888bd907777799271d04,1,I was a rookie to a veteran copy.
63b5888bd907777799271d04,2,There was a young person (related to the veteran) who was nice enough but annoying when they opened their mouth.
63b5888bd907777799271d04,3,They talked too much.
63b5888bd907777799271d04,4,I avoided them.
63b5888bd907777799271d04,5,They were offended by this and went missing.
63b5888bd907777799271d04,6,The Vet was annoyed and came to my apartment.
63b5888bd907777799271d04,7,I got a strategy to search for the missing person.
63b5888bd907777799271d04,8,We followed it.
63b5888bd907777799271d04,9,They turned up in the police station.
63b5888bd907777799271d04,10,They had not run away just chose not to be where they should be.
63b5888bd907777799271d04,11,"I was advised that the Vet would never forget by a colleague, Frank."
63b5888bd907777799271d04,12,I left.
63b5888bd907777799271d04,13,That was the end of my rookie year!
60c9fcbb6090f57f63cdbebf,1,It was the guys rookie year in the police
60c9fcbb6090f57f63cdbebf,2,and his Chief had a daughter
60c9fcbb6090f57f63cdbebf,3,who took a shine to him.
60c9fcbb6090f57f63cdbebf,4,He didn't realize it.
60c9fcbb6090f57f63cdbebf,5,One day she sent him a note
60c9fcbb6090f57f63cdbebf,6,but he didn't like her much
60c9fcbb6090f57f63cdbebf,7,because she was a chatterbox.
60c9fcbb6090f57f63cdbebf,8,The girl told him he was always scolding her
60c9fcbb6090f57f63cdbebf,9,because of him.
60c9fcbb6090f57f63cdbebf,10,One day she ran away.
60c9fcbb6090f57f63cdbebf,11,The Chief came to him
60c9fcbb6090f57f63cdbebf,12,and said she had run away.
60c9fcbb6090f57f63cdbebf,13,The rookie suggested they go look for her
60c9fcbb6090f57f63cdbebf,14,and then he could decide what to do as necessary.
60c9fcbb6090f57f63cdbebf,15,They went to where they found her scarf in the park.
60c9fcbb6090f57f63cdbebf,16,Found a few more things
60c9fcbb6090f57f63cdbebf,17,but couldn't find her.
60c9fcbb6090f57f63cdbebf,18,When they went back to the police station
60c9fcbb6090f57f63cdbebf,19,she was there reading a book.
60c9fcbb6090f57f63cdbebf,20,"The Deputy, Frank, told the rookie to transfer"
60c9fcbb6090f57f63cdbebf,21,because once the Chief got something in his mind
60c9fcbb6090f57f63cdbebf,22,he would never let it go.
60c9fcbb6090f57f63cdbebf,23,The rookie transferred
60c9fcbb6090f57f63cdbebf,24,and that was the end of his rookie year.
5e54309f0a98c705f68ae8a8,1,"The storyteller is a policeman,"
5e54309f0a98c705f68ae8a8,2,"and back when he was in his first year on the force,"
5e54309f0a98c705f68ae8a8,3,the police chief's daughter ran away.
5e54309f0a98c705f68ae8a8,4,"They looked for her together in the park,"
5e54309f0a98c705f68ae8a8,5,but ended up finding her in the police station.
603f82cb2fafec01e1d6470a,1,A man joined the police force.
603f82cb2fafec01e1d6470a,2,"While he was starting out,"
603f82cb2fafec01e1d6470a,3,the chief's daughter showed an interest.
603f82cb2fafec01e1d6470a,4,She flirted
603f82cb2fafec01e1d6470a,5,and one day told him she was leaving home
603f82cb2fafec01e1d6470a,6,because the chief was scolding her too much.
603f82cb2fafec01e1d6470a,7,She ran away
603f82cb2fafec01e1d6470a,8,and they looked everywhere for her.
603f82cb2fafec01e1d6470a,9,"When they found her,"
603f82cb2fafec01e1d6470a,10,it was in the police station
603f82cb2fafec01e1d6470a,11,and she was reading a book.
603f82cb2fafec01e1d6470a,12,Someone told the rookie to quit or transfer
603f82cb2fafec01e1d6470a,13,as her father would never forgive him.
5e99beb72892a5016ac5c6a7,1,He was a rookie cop
5e99beb72892a5016ac5c6a7,2,who worked for a highly thought of boss
5e99beb72892a5016ac5c6a7,3,who had been rewarded for service.
5e99beb72892a5016ac5c6a7,4,He did't really rate his boss.
5e99beb72892a5016ac5c6a7,5,She had a daughter.
5e99beb72892a5016ac5c6a7,6,she went missing
5e99beb72892a5016ac5c6a7,7,and a man turned up at his home
5e99beb72892a5016ac5c6a7,8,and he strategised to help find her.
5e99beb72892a5016ac5c6a7,9,They went to where her scarf had been found
5e99beb72892a5016ac5c6a7,10,and traced further
5e99beb72892a5016ac5c6a7,11,but to no avail.
5e99beb72892a5016ac5c6a7,12,She was at the police station
5e99beb72892a5016ac5c6a7,13,with a book.
5e99beb72892a5016ac5c6a7,14,He was advised to transfer
5e99beb72892a5016ac5c6a7,15,as the old man never forgot
5e99beb72892a5016ac5c6a7,16,He did
5e99beb72892a5016ac5c6a7,17,That was the end of his rookie years.
60f6f802c0ede08f7cf69720,1,The rookie policeman's boss was a veteran police officer.
60f6f802c0ede08f7cf69720,2,He had a daughter who fancied the rookie.
60f6f802c0ede08f7cf69720,3,The veteran police officer gave the daughter a hard time because she liked the rookie officer.
60f6f802c0ede08f7cf69720,4,The rookie officer did not like the daughter because she talked too much.
60f6f802c0ede08f7cf69720,5,It was said one day that she ran away.
60f6f802c0ede08f7cf69720,6,"The veteran police officer thought the rookie officer had something to do with the ""disappearance""."
60f6f802c0ede08f7cf69720,7,The rookie officer said they would look for her.
60f6f802c0ede08f7cf69720,8,If they did not find her the veteran police officer could do what he thought was right.
60f6f802c0ede08f7cf69720,9,They found her scarf.
60f6f802c0ede08f7cf69720,10,They eventually found her in the police station.
60f6f802c0ede08f7cf69720,11,The rookie officer was advised to leave the station.
60f6f802c0ede08f7cf69720,12,The veteran police officer would always have it in for him.
60f6f802c0ede08f7cf69720,13,He left.
5f9e93bb62e24043c32378d7,1,"Back in the days when I was a rookie in the police force,"
5f9e93bb62e24043c32378d7,2,the Chief was a veteran.
5f9e93bb62e24043c32378d7,3,He had caught a notorious criminal or had been awarded for bravery.
5f9e93bb62e24043c32378d7,4,But he had a young daughter.
5f9e93bb62e24043c32378d7,5,And in those days I was a fitness enthusiast
5f9e93bb62e24043c32378d7,6,"and it seemed she was trying to impress me,"
5f9e93bb62e24043c32378d7,7,I had never observed it.
5f9e93bb62e24043c32378d7,8,Truth is I wasn't very fond of them because they were.
5f9e93bb62e24043c32378d7,9,She was a charming girl until she started to speak.
5f9e93bb62e24043c32378d7,10,She was a chatterbox.
5f9e93bb62e24043c32378d7,11,And could she talk.
5f9e93bb62e24043c32378d7,12,"Then she left a message one day saying that she was going to run away,"
5f9e93bb62e24043c32378d7,13,because she was unhappy about me.
5f9e93bb62e24043c32378d7,14,He arrived at my apartment.
5f9e93bb62e24043c32378d7,15,A big intimidating look on his face.
5f9e93bb62e24043c32378d7,16,I managed to calm him down
5f9e93bb62e24043c32378d7,17,"and suggested that ""we'll search for her and if we can't locate her well you can do whatever you think is needed"""
5f9e93bb62e24043c32378d7,18,I was strategizing.
5f9e93bb62e24043c32378d7,19,So he accepted my offer.
5f9e93bb62e24043c32378d7,20,And we went to where they found her scarf near a park
5f9e93bb62e24043c32378d7,21,and we traced it down a little more
5f9e93bb62e24043c32378d7,22,and we couldn't locate her.
5f9e93bb62e24043c32378d7,23,"And returned it was a police station,"
5f9e93bb62e24043c32378d7,24,she was sitting on a chair with a book in her hands.
5f9e93bb62e24043c32378d7,25,"She hadn't run away,"
5f9e93bb62e24043c32378d7,26,nevertheless that resolved the issue that day.
5f9e93bb62e24043c32378d7,27,"That evening the deputy Mitchell said "" you better transfer and leave because that old man never forgets anything once gets it in his mind"""
5f9e93bb62e24043c32378d7,28,"And so I did, I transferred and left."
5f9e93bb62e24043c32378d7,29,That was the end of my rookie year.
59d54322c732930001d88b0f,1,"A police veteran had a daughter,"
59d54322c732930001d88b0f,2,she was trying to impress a man with fitness
59d54322c732930001d88b0f,3,but he wasn’t interested.
59d54322c732930001d88b0f,4,She went missing
59d54322c732930001d88b0f,5,"and they worked together to find her,"
59d54322c732930001d88b0f,6,they found her scarf
59d54322c732930001d88b0f,7,and she was at the police station reading a book.
5cb1fdb11a4c6a0015fdcdf7,1,I was a rookie policeman
5cb1fdb11a4c6a0015fdcdf7,2,and my senior was boss
5cb1fdb11a4c6a0015fdcdf7,3,his daughter went missing
5cb1fdb11a4c6a0015fdcdf7,4,she had a crush on me
5cb1fdb11a4c6a0015fdcdf7,5,she read a book
5cb1fdb11a4c6a0015fdcdf7,6,she lost her scarf
5cb1fdb11a4c6a0015fdcdf7,7,then the chief came to my house
5cb1fdb11a4c6a0015fdcdf7,8,we went to the place her scarf was found
5cb1fdb11a4c6a0015fdcdf7,9,but she turned up in the police station
5cb1fdb11a4c6a0015fdcdf7,10,sat on a chair
5cb1fdb11a4c6a0015fdcdf7,11,that was the end of my rookie days
5d2d5401d2f71900159663c1,1,"Back in my days,"
5d2d5401d2f71900159663c1,2,I was a rookie officer.
5d2d5401d2f71900159663c1,3,I had a boss
5d2d5401d2f71900159663c1,4,who had a daughter
5d2d5401d2f71900159663c1,5,that was a chatterbox.
5d2d5401d2f71900159663c1,6,One day he shows up at my door
5d2d5401d2f71900159663c1,7,"and I strategize a way to find her,"
5d2d5401d2f71900159663c1,8,from her scarf.
5d2d5401d2f71900159663c1,9,Eventually we find her
5d2d5401d2f71900159663c1,10,but she was not in trouble.
5d2d5401d2f71900159663c1,11,My boss Eric gives me an ultimatum
5d2d5401d2f71900159663c1,12,to transfer to a different department
5d2d5401d2f71900159663c1,13,which I take.
5d2d5401d2f71900159663c1,14,That is the end of my rookie year.
5422cca4fdf99b328c91b21b,1,"I was a rookie at the police station,"
5422cca4fdf99b328c91b21b,2,and my chief inspector there was a powerful man.
5422cca4fdf99b328c91b21b,3,He had a daughter
5422cca4fdf99b328c91b21b,4,who was always trying to get my attention
5422cca4fdf99b328c91b21b,5,"and to tell the truth,"
5422cca4fdf99b328c91b21b,6,I was not interested.
5422cca4fdf99b328c91b21b,7,"However she sent me a message,"
5422cca4fdf99b328c91b21b,8,"and then seemed to run away,"
5422cca4fdf99b328c91b21b,9,so her dad came to me to find out where she was.
5422cca4fdf99b328c91b21b,10,I said we should go and look for her
5422cca4fdf99b328c91b21b,11,and if we cannot find her
5422cca4fdf99b328c91b21b,12,then she should do whatever he feels is necessary.
5422cca4fdf99b328c91b21b,13,We went to where her scarf was
5422cca4fdf99b328c91b21b,14,"and she wasn't there,"
5422cca4fdf99b328c91b21b,15,but after looking a while we found her at the police station reading a book -
5422cca4fdf99b328c91b21b,16,she hadn't run away.
5422cca4fdf99b328c91b21b,17,I was warned afterwards by a police officer
5422cca4fdf99b328c91b21b,18,that I should redeploy
5422cca4fdf99b328c91b21b,19,"as the chief never forgets,"
5422cca4fdf99b328c91b21b,20,so that's what I did.
5422cca4fdf99b328c91b21b,21,And that was the end of my rookie year.
5cbf5803d2051000017d02fa,1,Back in the day in my time in the police force my manager/chief had a daughter.
5cbf5803d2051000017d02fa,2,I was in my rookie era.
5cbf5803d2051000017d02fa,3,I was a fitness enthusiast and his daughter was after me.
5cbf5803d2051000017d02fa,4,"She was a chatterbox,"
5cbf5803d2051000017d02fa,5,she never stopped talking.
5cbf5803d2051000017d02fa,6,"One day he turned up at my house and said she had gone missing,"
5cbf5803d2051000017d02fa,7,I said we best go and look.
5cbf5803d2051000017d02fa,8,We found a scarf and carried on looking
5cbf5803d2051000017d02fa,9,but it turns out she was at the police station.
5cbf5803d2051000017d02fa,10,After this I was told to relocate and transfer
5cbf5803d2051000017d02fa,11,"and the chief never forgets,"
5cbf5803d2051000017d02fa,12,so that’s it I transferred and left.
5fea352050a7199cfafc3fcb,1,My understanding is that the guy is talking about his experience as a rookie in the police force.
5fea352050a7199cfafc3fcb,2,He talks about his boss who is very experienced.
5fea352050a7199cfafc3fcb,3,He has some issues with a girl (fitness instructor or something) who he knows vaguely as he is interested in fitness too.
5fea352050a7199cfafc3fcb,4,This girl takes a liking to him but he does not feel the same.
5fea352050a7199cfafc3fcb,5,The girl leaves him a note of some sort and says she is going to run away.
5fea352050a7199cfafc3fcb,6,They attempt to locate her (find a red scarf?) and track her to the police station where they find her.
5fea352050a7199cfafc3fcb,7,"The chief, after this incident, suggests the rookie transfers to another police station."
6310d138e026879254c14bd1,1,A police chief's daughter
6310d138e026879254c14bd1,2,who was trying to impress me
6310d138e026879254c14bd1,3,ran away from home
6310d138e026879254c14bd1,4,because her dad always scolded her about me.
6310d138e026879254c14bd1,5,It turns out
6310d138e026879254c14bd1,6,she didn't run away
6310d138e026879254c14bd1,7,and was sat at a police station
6310d138e026879254c14bd1,8,with a book in her hands.
6310d138e026879254c14bd1,9,Frank Mitchell
6310d138e026879254c14bd1,10,a coworker
6310d138e026879254c14bd1,11,said
6310d138e026879254c14bd1,12,I need to leave anyway
6310d138e026879254c14bd1,13,because the old man won't get it out of his head
6310d138e026879254c14bd1,14,so I did.
6023cb37c452c802d4092a35,1,The policeman speaks about when he was a rookie and a fitness enthusiast.
6023cb37c452c802d4092a35,2,The Chief's daughter was fond of him
6023cb37c452c802d4092a35,3,but he wasn't
6023cb37c452c802d4092a35,4,because she was a chatterbox.
6023cb37c452c802d4092a35,5,She always tried to impress him.
6023cb37c452c802d4092a35,6,One day she threatened to runaway
6023cb37c452c802d4092a35,7,because her dad scolded her a lot.
6023cb37c452c802d4092a35,8,She disappeared
6023cb37c452c802d4092a35,9,"and the Chief came to his apartment looking for her,"
6023cb37c452c802d4092a35,10,she wasn't there
6023cb37c452c802d4092a35,11,and he suggested to help look for her.
6023cb37c452c802d4092a35,12,They went to where her scarf was found
6023cb37c452c802d4092a35,13,which was a park.
6023cb37c452c802d4092a35,14,They couldn't find her
6023cb37c452c802d4092a35,15,and eventually found her sitting at the police station bench.
6023cb37c452c802d4092a35,16,"That day the deputy Chief, Frank Mitchell suggested that he transfers"
6023cb37c452c802d4092a35,17,because the Chief never forgets
6023cb37c452c802d4092a35,18,and hold things.
627966f3451caac7a46ca880,1,Very hard to follow
627966f3451caac7a46ca880,2,but something about a police chief
627966f3451caac7a46ca880,3,with a rude daughter
627966f3451caac7a46ca880,4,and the trainee policeman
627966f3451caac7a46ca880,5,had to move away
627966f3451caac7a46ca880,6,because he didn't like him.
60603496c9a3d83273a11297,1,Back in the day when I was a rookie in the police force.
60603496c9a3d83273a11297,2,The chief was a veteran.
60603496c9a3d83273a11297,3,He had caught a notorious criminal.
60603496c9a3d83273a11297,4,But he had a younger daughter.
60603496c9a3d83273a11297,5,"In the early days, I was a fitness enthusiast."
60603496c9a3d83273a11297,6,I wasn't fond of her because she was a charming girl until she opened her mouth.
60603496c9a3d83273a11297,7,She could talk.
60603496c9a3d83273a11297,8,One day she left a note saying she was running away because he was always scolding her about me.
60603496c9a3d83273a11297,9,He came to my apartment intimidating look on his face.
60603496c9a3d83273a11297,10,I propose we look for her.
60603496c9a3d83273a11297,11,He accepted my offer.
60603496c9a3d83273a11297,12,They found her scarf near a park.
60603496c9a3d83273a11297,13,"At the police station, she was sitting on the chair."
60603496c9a3d83273a11297,14,She didn't run away.
60603496c9a3d83273a11297,15,He said I better transfer and leave.
60603496c9a3d83273a11297,16,I did transfer and leave.
60205f5ba5fe0165fa0e5e01,1,back in the day
60205f5ba5fe0165fa0e5e01,2,there was a a rookie cop
60205f5ba5fe0165fa0e5e01,3,who fell in love with his boss’s daughter.
60205f5ba5fe0165fa0e5e01,4,The boss found out
60205f5ba5fe0165fa0e5e01,5,and became upset
60205f5ba5fe0165fa0e5e01,6,forcing the daughter to run away from him.
60205f5ba5fe0165fa0e5e01,7,They went looking for her at a park
60205f5ba5fe0165fa0e5e01,8,"but couldn’t locate her,"
60205f5ba5fe0165fa0e5e01,9,when they went back to the station
60205f5ba5fe0165fa0e5e01,10,they found her sitting on a chair reading a book.
60205f5ba5fe0165fa0e5e01,11,the rookie later transferred jobs
60205f5ba5fe0165fa0e5e01,12,because of this whole ordeal
5e3752a476397a6e638bfc5e,1,A guy talks
5e3752a476397a6e638bfc5e,2,about the first year
5e3752a476397a6e638bfc5e,3,as a police officer.
5e3752a476397a6e638bfc5e,4,There's a girl
5e3752a476397a6e638bfc5e,5,that fancied him
5e3752a476397a6e638bfc5e,6,and they thought
5e3752a476397a6e638bfc5e,7,she ran away
5e3752a476397a6e638bfc5e,8,but she didn't
5e3752a476397a6e638bfc5e,9,but the guy was still asked to leave
5e3752a476397a6e638bfc5e,10,because the veteran officer
5e3752a476397a6e638bfc5e,11,wouldn't be able to forget
5e3752a476397a6e638bfc5e,12,what happened.
60ba46327fecef005d8eeb87,1,The author is talking about his rookie year
60ba46327fecef005d8eeb87,2,in which the senior officer's daughter became interested in him.
60ba46327fecef005d8eeb87,3,He was so interested in fitness activities.
60ba46327fecef005d8eeb87,4,The girl decided to run away from home
60ba46327fecef005d8eeb87,5,after mentioning that her father was bothering her
60ba46327fecef005d8eeb87,6,because of the author.
60ba46327fecef005d8eeb87,7,They began searching for her
60ba46327fecef005d8eeb87,8,and firstly they found her scarf
60ba46327fecef005d8eeb87,9,before finally finding her.
609252692568228b9e5399b0,1,I was a rookie in the police.
609252692568228b9e5399b0,2,My boss was a veteran with awards or something like that.
609252692568228b9e5399b0,3,He had a charming daughter who like me.
609252692568228b9e5399b0,4,I did not like her that much.
609252692568228b9e5399b0,5,"She was beautiful until she opened her mouth,"
609252692568228b9e5399b0,6,That girl could talk and talk.
609252692568228b9e5399b0,7,"She was always fighting with her father, my boss over me."
609252692568228b9e5399b0,8,One day she packed up and ran away.
609252692568228b9e5399b0,9,My boss came to my apartment with a threatening look
609252692568228b9e5399b0,10,And I promised to help him look for his daughter
609252692568228b9e5399b0,11,"And if we could not find her, he was free to do what he liked."
609252692568228b9e5399b0,12,We went to look to look for her at the park where her scarf had been found
609252692568228b9e5399b0,13,And we did not find her.
609252692568228b9e5399b0,14,"We later found her sitting in a corner at the police station,"
609252692568228b9e5399b0,15,She had not been lost after all.
609252692568228b9e5399b0,16,My friend Frank Mitchell told me to ask to be transferred
609252692568228b9e5399b0,17,Or else I would get in trouble with my boss.
609252692568228b9e5399b0,18,I asked to be transferred
609252692568228b9e5399b0,19,And that was it.
60ed995abcc068230f3c604d,1,He was a rookie in the police force.
60ed995abcc068230f3c604d,2,His superior had a daughter.
60ed995abcc068230f3c604d,3,Who was very fond of him.
60ed995abcc068230f3c604d,4,But he didn't like her.
60ed995abcc068230f3c604d,5,As she was a chatterbox.
60ed995abcc068230f3c604d,6,One day she went missing.
60ed995abcc068230f3c604d,7,And the superior arrived at the rookies apartment.
60ed995abcc068230f3c604d,8,Looking for her.
60ed995abcc068230f3c604d,9,He was very angry.
60ed995abcc068230f3c604d,10,She wasn't there.
60ed995abcc068230f3c604d,11,They looked.
60ed995abcc068230f3c604d,12,But couldn't find her.
60ed995abcc068230f3c604d,13,They resolved to contact the police.
60ed995abcc068230f3c604d,14,But she was at the station.
60ed995abcc068230f3c604d,15,When they got back.
60ed995abcc068230f3c604d,16,Frank Mitchell told the rookie to transfer from the station.
60ed995abcc068230f3c604d,17,And he did.
60b2827157e043215e6f997e,1,i had a rookie year.
60b2827157e043215e6f997e,2,when the captain the station commander had a daughter
60b2827157e043215e6f997e,3,whom was in love with me
60b2827157e043215e6f997e,4,she was a charming lady
60b2827157e043215e6f997e,5,who was a chatterbox
60b2827157e043215e6f997e,6,which made me uninterested in her
60b2827157e043215e6f997e,7,she decided to run away
60b2827157e043215e6f997e,8,because her dad used to scold her a lot.
60b2827157e043215e6f997e,9,the chief instructed me to look for her.
5f67ae1b22c41c0e44275dc2,1,"Back in my rookie year on the police force,"
5f67ae1b22c41c0e44275dc2,2,my Chief had a daughter who was quite fond of me.
5f67ae1b22c41c0e44275dc2,3,I was young and a fitness enthusiast.
5f67ae1b22c41c0e44275dc2,4,She liked me.
5f67ae1b22c41c0e44275dc2,5,But I didn't like her.
5f67ae1b22c41c0e44275dc2,6,And I though she was cute.
5f67ae1b22c41c0e44275dc2,7,But when she opened her mouth it was ruined.
5f67ae1b22c41c0e44275dc2,8,She was a chatterbox.
5f67ae1b22c41c0e44275dc2,9,I told her I was not interested.
5f67ae1b22c41c0e44275dc2,10,One day my Chief Mitchell came to me
5f67ae1b22c41c0e44275dc2,11,and said his daughter had run away.
5f67ae1b22c41c0e44275dc2,12,"I told him ""we will go look for her"
5f67ae1b22c41c0e44275dc2,13,"and then we will decide what to do."""
5f67ae1b22c41c0e44275dc2,14,I was bargaining.
5f67ae1b22c41c0e44275dc2,15,We went to the park where they had found her scarf.
5f67ae1b22c41c0e44275dc2,16,We looked all around but could not find her.
5f67ae1b22c41c0e44275dc2,17,Then we went to the police station
5f67ae1b22c41c0e44275dc2,18,and there she was reading a book.
5f67ae1b22c41c0e44275dc2,19,She hadn't run away at all.
5f67ae1b22c41c0e44275dc2,20,But - nevertheless- i was told to transfer to a new job
5f67ae1b22c41c0e44275dc2,21,because that old man never forgets anything.
60607afaf710537516a69546,1,Back in the day when I was a rookie…
60607afaf710537516a69546,2,there was a man with a daughter.
60607afaf710537516a69546,3,she was a charming girl until she opened her mouth.
60607afaf710537516a69546,4,"Goodness, she could talk."
60607afaf710537516a69546,5,She left a message saying she was going to run away.
60607afaf710537516a69546,6,He was intimidating.
60607afaf710537516a69546,7,I searched for her.
60607afaf710537516a69546,8,We went to a park.
60607afaf710537516a69546,9,Back at the station she was there.
60607afaf710537516a69546,10,I was told to transfer and leave which is what I did.
60607afaf710537516a69546,11,That is what I recall from my rookie year.
5d667a1a3741ea0001c719b9,1,A man describes his rookie year as a policeman.
5d667a1a3741ea0001c719b9,2,"His chief, named Frank Mitchell, had a daughter who was very taken with the author."
5d667a1a3741ea0001c719b9,3,"But he did not return her interest, mostly because she talked too much (she was a 'chatterbox')."
5d667a1a3741ea0001c719b9,4,"He tells of the time the chief showed up at his house, saying the daughter had run away because the chief always gave her a hard time over talking about the author so much."
5d667a1a3741ea0001c719b9,5,"The author said he knew nothing about, was not involved, but would help find her so the chief could see the truth and act as he thought was appropriate."
5d667a1a3741ea0001c719b9,6,"They found the girl's scarf in the park, but no other clues."
5d667a1a3741ea0001c719b9,7,"When they went back to the police station they found the girl there, sitting reading a book."
5d667a1a3741ea0001c719b9,8,"The author was advised to transfer out, because even though he did nothing wrong, the chief would still remember the incident."
5d667a1a3741ea0001c719b9,9,The author took his advice and transferred out.
60abb40fe8824c6f9007faeb,1,"When I was a rookie in the police force,"
60abb40fe8824c6f9007faeb,2,the chief was a veteran.
60abb40fe8824c6f9007faeb,3,He caught a criminal
60abb40fe8824c6f9007faeb,4,and he was rewarded.
60abb40fe8824c6f9007faeb,5,He had a young daughter
60abb40fe8824c6f9007faeb,6,who was very beautiful
60abb40fe8824c6f9007faeb,7,and she was trying to impress me.
60abb40fe8824c6f9007faeb,8,I was charmed by her
60abb40fe8824c6f9007faeb,9,but she was a chatterbox.
60abb40fe8824c6f9007faeb,10,One day she left me a message
60abb40fe8824c6f9007faeb,11,saying she was going to run away
60abb40fe8824c6f9007faeb,12,because her dad was always scolding her.
60abb40fe8824c6f9007faeb,13,Me and her father went to search for her.
60abb40fe8824c6f9007faeb,14,We found her at the police station
60abb40fe8824c6f9007faeb,15,reading a book
60abb40fe8824c6f9007faeb,16,which meant she didn't run away.
5d66c1382d1a18000170759b,1,A rookie police man joined in his first year.
5d66c1382d1a18000170759b,2,The chief's daughter took a liking to the rookie.
5d66c1382d1a18000170759b,3,She argued with her father unbeknown to the rookie.
5d66c1382d1a18000170759b,4,The daughter ran away.
5d66c1382d1a18000170759b,5,The police chief assumed the rookie had something to do with it.
5d66c1382d1a18000170759b,6,He went to the rookies house.
5d66c1382d1a18000170759b,7,The rookie needed the chief to calm down.
5d66c1382d1a18000170759b,8,He offered to help search for the missing daughter.
5d66c1382d1a18000170759b,9,They found her at a police station unharmed.
5d66c1382d1a18000170759b,10,Someone recommended the rookie transfer following the incident.
5d66c1382d1a18000170759b,11,The chief would hold it against him.
5d66c1382d1a18000170759b,12,It could impact the rookies career.
5d66c1382d1a18000170759b,13,The rookie transferred.
5d66c1382d1a18000170759b,14,He left.
60a65fa78c5f119da5e887e6,1,"Back then when I was a rookie,"
60a65fa78c5f119da5e887e6,2,we had a veteran in our department who had caught a notorious criminal.
60a65fa78c5f119da5e887e6,3,I was a fitness enthusiast
60a65fa78c5f119da5e887e6,4,and this veteran had a daughter who took a liking to me.
60a65fa78c5f119da5e887e6,5,She was charming
60a65fa78c5f119da5e887e6,6,but the moment she opened her mouth she was a chatterbox
60a65fa78c5f119da5e887e6,7,boy she could talk.
60a65fa78c5f119da5e887e6,8,I could not handle her talking.
60a65fa78c5f119da5e887e6,9,One day the veteran came to look for me
60a65fa78c5f119da5e887e6,10,and said she was missing because he had scolded her about me.
60a65fa78c5f119da5e887e6,11,I suggest we go look for her
60a65fa78c5f119da5e887e6,12,and if we didn't find her he could do whatever he saw fit.
60a65fa78c5f119da5e887e6,13,I was strategizing.
60a65fa78c5f119da5e887e6,14,We went to the park where her scarf was found
60a65fa78c5f119da5e887e6,15,but she was not there.
60a65fa78c5f119da5e887e6,16,We found her at the police station where she was reading a book.
60a65fa78c5f119da5e887e6,17,I went home
60a65fa78c5f119da5e887e6,18,and deputy Frank Miller came to see me
60a65fa78c5f119da5e887e6,19,and said I better move because the old man never forgets.
60a65fa78c5f119da5e887e6,20,So I moved.
60a65fa78c5f119da5e887e6,21,Those were my rookie days.
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,1,"Back in the days when I was a rookie in the police force,"
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,2,the Chief was a veteran.
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,3,He had caught a notorious criminal –
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,4,or had been awarded for bravery.
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,5,But he had – a young daughter.
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,6,And in those days I was a fitness enthusiast.
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,7,And it seemed she was trying to impress me.
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,8,I never observed it.
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,9,Truth is I wasn't very fond of her because she was –
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,10,She was a charming girl until she opened her mouth.
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,11,She was a chatterbox.
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,12,"Goodness, she could talk."
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,13,Then she left a message one day saying she was going to run away because he was always scolding her about me.
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,14,He arrived at my apartment.
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,15,Big intimidating look on his face.
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,16,I managed to calm him down.
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,17,and proposed “Well we'll search for her and if we can't locate her well you can – do whatever you think is right.”
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,18,I was strategizing.
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,19,So he accepted my offer.
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,20,And we went to where they found her scarf – near a park.
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,21,and we traced down a little more and we couldn't locate her.
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,22,And returned – it was a police station –
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,23,she was sitting on a chair with a book in her hands.
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,24,She hadn't run away.
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,25,But – nevertheless – that resolved the issue for that day.
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,26,"But that evening the deputy, Frank Mitchell, said “You better transfer and leave because that old man never forgets anything once he gets it into his mind.”"
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,27,And I did.
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,28,I transferred.
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,29,and left.
60ff2de87f8a6665bcff2144,30,That was the end of my rookie year.
642ea9a95d8d96e72339424e,1,A rookie policeman went looking for a girl
642ea9a95d8d96e72339424e,2,and couldn't find her.
642ea9a95d8d96e72339424e,3,She later turned up in the police station
642ea9a95d8d96e72339424e,4,"and the rookie policeman was encouraged to transfer,"
642ea9a95d8d96e72339424e,5,and he did.
609101a8a29bc713a6bcdbba,1,The was a rookie police officer
609101a8a29bc713a6bcdbba,2,The chief was veteran.
609101a8a29bc713a6bcdbba,3,He had a daughter
609101a8a29bc713a6bcdbba,4,Who liked me
609101a8a29bc713a6bcdbba,5,But I did not really like her
609101a8a29bc713a6bcdbba,6,Because she is a chatterbox
609101a8a29bc713a6bcdbba,7,She talks too much.
609101a8a29bc713a6bcdbba,8,She was angry with her father
609101a8a29bc713a6bcdbba,9,Because he was always complaining about me.
609101a8a29bc713a6bcdbba,10,She said she will run away.
609101a8a29bc713a6bcdbba,11,The father came to my place
609101a8a29bc713a6bcdbba,12,Looking for her
609101a8a29bc713a6bcdbba,13,But she was not there
609101a8a29bc713a6bcdbba,14,So we agreed to go look for her
609101a8a29bc713a6bcdbba,15,We found her scarf in the park
609101a8a29bc713a6bcdbba,16,"But she was not there,"
609101a8a29bc713a6bcdbba,17,When we went back to the police station
609101a8a29bc713a6bcdbba,18,We found her sitting on a chair
609101a8a29bc713a6bcdbba,19,Holding a book
609101a8a29bc713a6bcdbba,20,She did not run away.
609101a8a29bc713a6bcdbba,21,I was told to transfer
609101a8a29bc713a6bcdbba,22,Because the old man will not forget what happened
609101a8a29bc713a6bcdbba,23,It was best for me to leave
609101a8a29bc713a6bcdbba,24,And that is what I did.
5f413867991f880a34f5b28d,1,"Back in the day when I was a rookie in the police force,"
5f413867991f880a34f5b28d,2,the Chief was a veteran.
5f413867991f880a34f5b28d,3,"He had a daughter,"
5f413867991f880a34f5b28d,4,"athletic one,"
5f413867991f880a34f5b28d,5,but she never impressed me.
5f413867991f880a34f5b28d,6,She was really cute until she opened her mouth.
5f413867991f880a34f5b28d,7,She was a chatterbox.
5f413867991f880a34f5b28d,8,She got mad and chief thought she run away.
5f413867991f880a34f5b28d,9,"We searched for her at the park where they found her scarf,"
5f413867991f880a34f5b28d,10,but she wasn't there.
5f413867991f880a34f5b28d,11,"She was at the police station,"
5f413867991f880a34f5b28d,12,with a book in her hands.
5f413867991f880a34f5b28d,13,She didn't run away after all.
5f413867991f880a34f5b28d,14,"Someone told me to transfer,"
5f413867991f880a34f5b28d,15,because the old man never forgets.
5f413867991f880a34f5b28d,16,I listened to him and transferred.
5f413867991f880a34f5b28d,17,That was the end of my rookie year.
5d5c250a0274020016e2333a,1,"When I was a rookie at the police station,"
5d5c250a0274020016e2333a,2,"the chief, who was then a veteran won an award for bravery."
5d5c250a0274020016e2333a,3,The chief had a daughter
5d5c250a0274020016e2333a,4,who was attracted to me because of my love of fitness.
5d5c250a0274020016e2333a,5,However the chief's daughter was a chatterbox
5d5c250a0274020016e2333a,6,and I therefore did not return her feelings.
5d5c250a0274020016e2333a,7,One day she left a note
5d5c250a0274020016e2333a,8,saying she was running away
5d5c250a0274020016e2333a,9,after her father had been scolding her about me.
5d5c250a0274020016e2333a,10,"We went to look for her,"
5d5c250a0274020016e2333a,11,going to where he had found her scarf.
5d5c250a0274020016e2333a,12,"In the end she was found sitting in the police station reading,"
5d5c250a0274020016e2333a,13,so she had not run away.
5d5c250a0274020016e2333a,14,"A senior police officer, Mitchell, advised me to transfer"
5d5c250a0274020016e2333a,15,and so I did.
5c8808098d2bbf0017e4b527,1,I was a rookie cop.
5c8808098d2bbf0017e4b527,2,My boss was very experienced.
5c8808098d2bbf0017e4b527,3,A young person was reported missing.
5c8808098d2bbf0017e4b527,4,"Turns out she didn't run away,"
5c8808098d2bbf0017e4b527,5,but turned herself in to the police station.
5c8808098d2bbf0017e4b527,6,Someone told me to leave the force
5c8808098d2bbf0017e4b527,7,since my boss never forgets anything.
5c8808098d2bbf0017e4b527,8,"I did,"
5c8808098d2bbf0017e4b527,9,I quit.
5f7ca372a8afc510abbbe99b,1,A girl ran away.
5f7ca372a8afc510abbbe99b,2,A man was angry with the narrator about it.
5f7ca372a8afc510abbbe99b,3,"The narrator offered to look for her with him,"
5f7ca372a8afc510abbbe99b,4,they only found her scarf near a park.
5f7ca372a8afc510abbbe99b,5,They went to the police station
5f7ca372a8afc510abbbe99b,6,and she was there.
5f7ca372a8afc510abbbe99b,7,The policeman there told him to transfer
5f7ca372a8afc510abbbe99b,8,because the man 'never forgets something once he gets it in his head'
5f7ca372a8afc510abbbe99b,9,so he did transfer
5f7ca372a8afc510abbbe99b,10,and that was the end of his rookie year.
5a5e03dd8e62590001762542,1,Back in the day I was a rookie
5a5e03dd8e62590001762542,2,and my chief was a veteran
5a5e03dd8e62590001762542,3,he had a daughter who liked me.
5a5e03dd8e62590001762542,4,She was nice
5a5e03dd8e62590001762542,5,until she opened her mouth
5a5e03dd8e62590001762542,6,she was a chatterbox.
5a5e03dd8e62590001762542,7,One day she ran away
5a5e03dd8e62590001762542,8,because her father kept scolding her about me
5a5e03dd8e62590001762542,9,"he was angry with me,"
5a5e03dd8e62590001762542,10,so I suggested we look for her.
5a5e03dd8e62590001762542,11,We found her scarf in a park
5a5e03dd8e62590001762542,12,but not her.
5a5e03dd8e62590001762542,13,She hadn't run away
5a5e03dd8e62590001762542,14,she was back at the police station reading a book.
5a5e03dd8e62590001762542,15,The deputy suggested I should transfer
5a5e03dd8e62590001762542,16,as the old man had a long memory.
5a5e03dd8e62590001762542,17,I did
5a5e03dd8e62590001762542,18,and that was the end of my rookie year.
5c71ca9bf6c9fe00013ef0b5,1,It was my rookie year at a Police Station.
5c71ca9bf6c9fe00013ef0b5,2,The captain there was a veteran and had received commendations for bravery and for capturing a criminal.
5c71ca9bf6c9fe00013ef0b5,3,His daughter liked me.
5c71ca9bf6c9fe00013ef0b5,4,I was a fitness fanatic.
5c71ca9bf6c9fe00013ef0b5,5,But I didn't like her.
5c71ca9bf6c9fe00013ef0b5,6,She talked far too much.
5c71ca9bf6c9fe00013ef0b5,7,One day she left me a message saying that she was going to run away.
5c71ca9bf6c9fe00013ef0b5,8,As her father (my boss) was always telling her off about her infatuation with me.
5c71ca9bf6c9fe00013ef0b5,9,Her father came to my apartment that evening.
5c71ca9bf6c9fe00013ef0b5,10,And was very intimidating.
5c71ca9bf6c9fe00013ef0b5,11,But I was able to calm him down.
5c71ca9bf6c9fe00013ef0b5,12,And suggested that we team up and look for her.
5c71ca9bf6c9fe00013ef0b5,13,He agreed with this.
5c71ca9bf6c9fe00013ef0b5,14,And we started searching at a point where her scarf had been discovered.
5c71ca9bf6c9fe00013ef0b5,15,We were unsuccessful.
5c71ca9bf6c9fe00013ef0b5,16,I encouraged him to keep looking.
5c71ca9bf6c9fe00013ef0b5,17,And we headed back to the Police Station.
5c71ca9bf6c9fe00013ef0b5,18,"His daughter was in there, sitting in a chair, with a book in her hand."
5c71ca9bf6c9fe00013ef0b5,19,Although that situation was resolved.
5c71ca9bf6c9fe00013ef0b5,20,I was soon warned by her father's Deputy that my boss wouldn't forget this.
5c71ca9bf6c9fe00013ef0b5,21,And would likely blame me for the situation.
5c71ca9bf6c9fe00013ef0b5,22,He (the deputy) suggested that I transfer away from that Station.
5c71ca9bf6c9fe00013ef0b5,23,I took his advice.
5c71ca9bf6c9fe00013ef0b5,24,And did so.
5c71ca9bf6c9fe00013ef0b5,25,And concluded my rookie year at another Station.

5a27eee353fc4b0001414fe8,2,The chief has a daughter
5a27eee353fc4b0001414fe8,3,but rookie is not keen on her
5a27eee353fc4b0001414fe8,4,as she talks too much.
5a27eee353fc4b0001414fe8,5,She told the chief she was running away.
5a27eee353fc4b0001414fe8,6,They go and look for her
5a27eee353fc4b0001414fe8,7,and find her scarf
5a27eee353fc4b0001414fe8,8,but not her.
5a27eee353fc4b0001414fe8,9,On returning she is at the police station.
5a27eee353fc4b0001414fe8,10,Another officer tells the rookie that the Chief will be out to get him now
5a27eee353fc4b0001414fe8,11,"and he should leave,"
5a27eee353fc4b0001414fe8,12,so he does.
6054ce9cd4e5c96ab84e9113,1,ONE DAY
6054ce9cd4e5c96ab84e9113,2,i WAS IN A POLICE FORCE

6054ce9cd4e5c96ab84e9113,4,AND SAW A DAUGHTER
6054ce9cd4e5c96ab84e9113,5,WHO WAS A CHATTERBOX
5eaeddb6a7e04f5af6b3e879,1,A rookie was working for a chief at the police station

5eaeddb6a7e04f5af6b3e879,4,who was quite keen on the rookie
5eaeddb6a7e04f5af6b3e879,5,and he thought she was quite nice
5eaeddb6a7e04f5af6b3e879,6,until she opened her voice.
5eaeddb6a7e04f5af6b3e879,7,He thought her a chatterbox.
5eaeddb6a7e04f5af6b3e879,8,The chief argued with the daughter over the rookie
5eaeddb6a7e04f5af6b3e879,9,and one day she disappeared.
5eaeddb6a7e04f5af6b3e879,10,They tried to locate her
5eaeddb6a7e04f5af6b3e879,11,but eventually found her sitting quietly in the police station reading a book.
5eaeddb6a7e04f5af6b3e879,12,She had not run away at all.
5eaeddb6a7e04f5af6b3e879,13,The deputy warned the rookie
5eaeddb6a7e04f5af6b3e879,14,that maybe he should move to a different station
5eaeddb6a7e04f5af6b3e879,15,as the old man would never forget this incidence.
5df252f758a5c71603afc39a,1,The narrator worked in a police station.
5df252f758a5c71603afc39a,2,His Chief was a veteran
5df252f758a5c71603afc39a,3,and was awarded commendation for his bravery.
5df252f758a5c71603afc39a,4,Chief had a daughter
5df252f758a5c71603afc39a,5,that liked the main character
5df252f758a5c71603afc39a,6,but he didn't like her so much
5df252f758a5c71603afc39a,7,because she was a chatterbox.
5df252f758a5c71603afc39a,8,The Chief didn't like his daughter seeing the narrator
5df252f758a5c71603afc39a,9,and he would scold her for talking to him.
5df252f758a5c71603afc39a,10,She ran away because of this
5df252f758a5c71603afc39a,11,and the Chief came to the narrators house
5df252f758a5c71603afc39a,12,so they could look for her.
5df252f758a5c71603afc39a,13,They went to a park
5df252f758a5c71603afc39a,14,and found her scarf.

5df252f758a5c71603afc39a,16,sitting on a chair
5df252f758a5c71603afc39a,17,reading a book
5df252f758a5c71603afc39a,18,when they found her.

5df252f758a5c71603afc39a,20,because even though she wasn't lost
5df252f758a5c71603afc39a,21,the Chief doesn't forget things
5df252f758a5c71603afc39a,22,and would make it difficult for the narrator to stay.
5df252f758a5c71603afc39a,23,He ended up transferring
5df252f758a5c71603afc39a,24,and that was his experience of his first year as a rookie.
