The scene is set near a park in the 1980s, where the Chief, a bearded man in his 60s, and the rookie officer, a fit young man in his mid-20s with light blonde hair, are searching for clues. Both are in their dark police uniforms. They are examining an area where a scarf was found, adding tension and focus to the scene. The setting has a wooded area with trees and a path leading into the park. The lighting suggests dusk or early evening, with shadows casting a mysterious atmosphere as they look for the Chief's daughter.
