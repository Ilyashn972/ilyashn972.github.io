Inside a late 1980s police station, the atmosphere is calm following the resolution of the earlier search. The Chief, a bearded man in his 60s in his dark uniform, is visibly relieved, sitting or standing with a relaxed posture. The rookie officer, a fit young man in his mid-20s with light blonde hair, stands nearby, appearing satisfied and relieved. The Chief's daughter, 18 years old with black hair, sits nearby, calm and composed. The room is warmly lit, suggesting resolution and mutual understanding, typical of an 80s station with desks and tracking boards visible in the background, focusing on the relief and conclusion of the night's events.
