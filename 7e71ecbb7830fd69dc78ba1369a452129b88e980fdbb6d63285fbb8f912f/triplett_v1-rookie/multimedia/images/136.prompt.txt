A young rookie police officer with light blond hair stands at the entrance of a police station, clutching a box of personal items. He's in full police uniform, but his posture is slumped, and his expression is somber. The late afternoon sun casts long shadows, highlighting the sadness of his departure. The sky is warm, suggesting the end of the day. The station's name is prominently displayed above the doorway, serving as a poignant backdrop to his departure.
