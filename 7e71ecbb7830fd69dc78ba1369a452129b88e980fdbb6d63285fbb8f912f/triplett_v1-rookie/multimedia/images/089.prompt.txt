Inside a late 1980s police station, the Chief's daughter, an 18-year-old with black hair, is sitting calmly on a chair, holding a book. She wears a vibrant outfit, like a light blazer and jeans. The Chief, a bearded man in his 60s in a dark uniform, shows relief and slight exasperation as he stands nearby. The rookie officer, a fit young man in his mid-20s with light blonde hair, looks relieved and slightly amused by the situation. The room is warmly lit, typical of an 80s station with desks and old computers, creating an atmosphere of homely order amidst the night's events.
