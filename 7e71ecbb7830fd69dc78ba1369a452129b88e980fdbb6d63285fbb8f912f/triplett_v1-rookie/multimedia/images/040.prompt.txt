In a bustling outdoor cafe or picnic area in a park set in the 1980s, the Chief's daughter, an 18-year-old with black hair, is energetically chatting. She's wearing a vibrant electric blue blazer and light wash jeans. The rookie officer, in his mid-20s with light blonde hair, is sitting across from her, appearing bemused as he listens to her rapid chatter. The lively scene is filled with other people, laughter, and conversation. The sky is bright, adding to the energetic and social atmosphere.
