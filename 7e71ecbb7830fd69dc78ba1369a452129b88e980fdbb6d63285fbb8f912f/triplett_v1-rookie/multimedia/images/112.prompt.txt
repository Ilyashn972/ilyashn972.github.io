A tranquil outdoor scene near a police station in 2020, depicting dusk with a mature officer in his late 40s, light blond hair slightly grey, dressed in smart-casual attire. He stands reflectively, looking at the station. The modernized station has warm lights illuminating its facade. It's late autumn, with fallen leaves and a crisp feel. City lights start to flicker on, and the sky is painted with purple and deep blue, stars just emerging. A path lined with contemporary solar street lamps leads forward, symbolizing future paths.
