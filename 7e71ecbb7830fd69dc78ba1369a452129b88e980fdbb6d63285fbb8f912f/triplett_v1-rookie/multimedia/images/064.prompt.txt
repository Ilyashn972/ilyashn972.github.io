Set inside a police car in the 1980s. The Chief, a bearded man in his 60s, is seated next to the rookie officer, a fit young man in his mid-20s with light blonde hair. Both are in their dark police uniforms. They are engaged in a serious conversation, with the rookie officer proposing a plan to search for the Chief's daughter. The car is dimly lit by the dashboard lights, creating an atmosphere of focus and urgency. The Chief listens intently, nodding in agreement. Streetlights from outside provide additional soft lighting, outlining their determined expressions.
