The scene shows a young police officer sitting at a desk in a small, dimly lit police station from the 1980s or 1990s. The officer, a man in his mid-20s and a fitness enthusiast, is in a dark standard police uniform with short sleeves. The room contains a rotary phone on the desk and an old analogue clock on the wall. Plaques and awards can be seen on the wall behind, hinting at past achievements. The Chief, a man in his late 50s with a stern physical presence and no beard, is also present, wearing a decorated uniform. The warm lighting creates a tired yet homely ambiance in the station.
