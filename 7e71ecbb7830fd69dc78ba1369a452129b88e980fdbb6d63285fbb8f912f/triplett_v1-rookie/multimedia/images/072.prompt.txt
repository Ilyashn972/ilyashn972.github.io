The scene continues in the park at night, featuring the Chief, a bearded man in his 60s, and the rookie officer, a fit young man in his mid-20s with light blonde hair, as they search further for the Chief's daughter. Both are in their dark police uniforms. The area is dimly lit by street lamps or handheld flashlights, casting long shadows as they cross a bridge or open area, looking intently for more clues. The night adds mystery and urgency, reflected in their focused and concerned expressions.
