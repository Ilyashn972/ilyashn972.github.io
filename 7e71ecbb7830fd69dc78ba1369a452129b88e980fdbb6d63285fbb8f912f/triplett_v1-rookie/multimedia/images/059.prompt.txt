The scene captures the Chief and the rookie officer leaving the apartment together. The apartment features modest 1980s decor. The Chief, a bearded man in his 60s, is wearing a decorated dark police uniform and appears more relaxed. The rookie officer, a fit young man in his mid-20s with light blonde hair, is also in his dark police uniform, walking alongside him. They step through the doorway into the soft evening light, suggesting resolution and cooperation after a tense confrontation. The warm ambient light from the apartment adds to the sense of reconciliation.
