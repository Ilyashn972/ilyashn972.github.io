An evening scene set in a dimly lit police station office. Deputy Frank Mitchell, a middle-aged man in a neat police uniform, leans slightly toward a young rookie officer with light blond hair, who appears attentive and conflicted. They are in a serious conversation amid desks with paperwork and subdued lighting casting long shadows. A large window shows the night sky outside, dotted with city lights. A steaming mug of coffee is on the table, indicating a long evening. The atmosphere is earnest and serious, reflecting the advice being given.
