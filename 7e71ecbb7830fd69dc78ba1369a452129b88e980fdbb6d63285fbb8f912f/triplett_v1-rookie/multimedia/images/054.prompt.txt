The scene is set inside the rookie officer's modest apartment in the 1980s. The Chief, a bearded man in his 60s with a stern, intimidating look, stands by the door in a decorated dark police uniform. His presence is commanding and serious. The rookie officer, a fit young man in his mid-20s with light blonde hair, is inside the apartment, wearing casual home attire and showing a surprised or slightly apprehensive expression. The apartment has a simple, neat 1980s decor, with ambient lighting from ceiling lights or a nearby lamp, contributing to its cozy atmosphere.
