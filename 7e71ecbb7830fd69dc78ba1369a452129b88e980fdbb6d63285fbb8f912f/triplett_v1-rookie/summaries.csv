"As a rookie in the police force, the narrator worked under a veteran Chief who had a notorious reputation for his bravery and achievements, including capturing a notorious criminal. The Chief had a young daughter who seemed to be trying to impress the narrator, a fitness enthusiast at the time. However, the narrator was not very fond of her due to her incessant talking. One day, the Chief's daughter left a message claiming she was going to run away because her father constantly scolded her about the narrator. Concerned, the Chief confronted the narrator at his apartment with a stern and intimidating demeanor. The narrator managed to calm him down and suggested they search for her together, agreeing that if they couldn't find her, the Chief could take whatever action he deemed necessary.

They began their search and found her scarf near a park, which led them to believe she might be nearby. However, after an extensive search, they were unable to locate her and returned to the police station. To their relief, they found the Chief's daughter there, unharmed and engrossed in reading a book. She had not run away after all. Although the immediate crisis was averted, the situation left a lasting impression on the Chief.

That evening, Deputy Frank Mitchell warned the narrator that the Chief was not someone who easily forgot such incidents and suggested that it might be safer for the narrator to transfer to another location. Taking this advice seriously, the narrator requested a transfer and left, marking the end of his eventful rookie year in the police force. This experience highlighted the complexities of personal relationships within the law enforcement community and the potential repercussions of misunderstandings.",1741,304.4170074589,0.17
