I did not like her as she was a chatterbox. One day she went missing and the chief came to my apartment to confront me.

But he did not return her interest, mostly because she talked too much (she was a 'chatterbox'). He tells of the time the chief showed up at his house, saying the daughter had run away because the chief always gave her a hard time over talking about the author so much. The author said he knew nothing about, was not involved, but would help find her so the chief could see the truth and act as he thought was appropriate. They found the girl's scarf in the park, but no other clues. When they went back to the police station they found the girl there, sitting reading a book. The author was advised to transfer out, because even though he did nothing wrong, the chief would still remember the incident. The author took his advice and transferred out.",883,156.79705815,0.18
