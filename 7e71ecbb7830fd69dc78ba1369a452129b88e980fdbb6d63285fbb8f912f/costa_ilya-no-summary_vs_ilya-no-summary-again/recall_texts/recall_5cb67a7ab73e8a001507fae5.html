  <h2>Original recall (ilya-no-summary)</h2>
  <pre>
This story is being told by Mrs. Costa, a mother who lost her eighteen year old daughter Maria 28 years ago after a surgery for an appendix removal.  Maria died from blood clots in her leg.  It was a shock for everyone in the family that this occurred.  It was a shock for all those that knew Maria and the family as well as she was so young.  The mother is reflecting on what happened and how everyone was impacted especially herself.  How she lost it at that time and laid the blame on the doctors, female doctors.

  <h2>Again recall (ilya-no-summary-again)</h2>
  <pre>
If I am being honest I am not remembering this story at all.  A lady who lost her daughter - nothing is coming to mind at all in reference to this prompt.  I am sorry but I have nothing here to relate.  I hope this does not reflect bad on me or cause an issue with my participation.
