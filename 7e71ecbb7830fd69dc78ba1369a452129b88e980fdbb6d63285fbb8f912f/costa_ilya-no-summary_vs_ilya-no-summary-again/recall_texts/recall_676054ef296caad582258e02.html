  <h2>Original recall (ilya-no-summary)</h2>
  <pre>
The woman&#x27;s (Mary?) daughter, Marie, was in the hospital for an operation. Everything seemed to be going okay and the woman received a phone call to come and pick up her daughter as she was to be discharged. Her husband waited on the step and she went. She got to the hospital and sat down and someone asked her if her daughter ever fainted. She asked if that was who the nurse was running for, and then she went to her daughter&#x27;s room. Her daughter was dressed on the bed with giant beads of sweat running down her head and the mother started yelling why did you kill my daughter. It&#x27;s because you made her get up to because the doctor said she was to be moved but the 18-year old was still under ether. They got her up and she said she had a pain in her leg and collapsed. The mother continued screaming and pulling her own hair and as she was turned around, her daughter passed. Rita came and she asked what was the matter and the mother said that Marie had died. They went home and the husband was on the step and he asked what&#x27;s the matter and he had a heart attack when he heard. Her son Michael also had a heart attack. A person said later how she could picture Marie standing near the store, who was a shy and pleasant girl.

  <h2>Again recall (ilya-no-summary-again)</h2>
  <pre>
There was a lady and her daughter was in hospital (for an operation?). She went to the hospital and the nurses and doctors made her daughter get up to move her to another bed? She didn&#x27;t think this was a good idea but they did it anyway. Her daughter went funny and suddenly died and the woman was very upset about it and shouted (I think) at them. Then she went home after talking to someone in a waiting room, or something. The girl&#x27;s brother or dad was waiting for the girl to come home but the woman had to tell them she had died and then the father killed himself and someone remembered her in the shop a while back.
