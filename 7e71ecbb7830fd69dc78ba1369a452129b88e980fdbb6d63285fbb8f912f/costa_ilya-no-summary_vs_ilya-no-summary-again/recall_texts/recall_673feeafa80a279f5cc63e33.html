Eventually they took her home and she screamed in the car all the way home and was screaming when she got back to her home and all the neighbors came out of their doors to see what was happening.

A young girl[Emily?] was in the hospital and it was time to come home. Her Mom [Linda?] went to pick up her up. When she got there she was told her daughter died she was very distraught and couldn&#x27;t believe this happened and wanted answers she didn&#x27;t want any nurses or doctors touching her daughter or herself at this point she was very confused of what went on at this hospital for her daughter to have died. Her sister made coffee for when she arrived home and her father sat on the doorstep after showering waiting for her. Linda came home and told them she had died. Linda&#x27;s sister was supposed to come over after she brought Emily home had wondered why she hadn&#x27;t heard from her. When she told her husband he had a heart attack and her son Emily&#x27;s brother also died of a heart attack around the same time. [That&#x27;s all of my memory :)]
