  <h2>Original recall (ilya-no-summary)</h2>
  <pre>
The narrator&#x27;s daughter died in hospital, she&#x27;s in hospital and was expected to come home but died in the hospital. The narrator is not happy and wants to burn the hospital down. She tells her husband who then has a heart attack, as does her son. Her other son goes to tell his aunts what happened and she goes to the shop and the shop worker always talks about her daughter when she goes in.
  </pre>
  <h2>Again recall (ilya-no-summary-again)</h2>
  <pre>
If I&#x27;m honest I don&#x27;t remember anything about this story. I have a vague memory of a woman going into work to meet a friend but that&#x27;s about it.
