we took our daughter to hospital for treatment. she was admited and we used to go and visit during visit hours every day, me and my other daughter. she was doing well we had all hope of going with her back home sooner. one day i left as usual to go to the hospital, there father was around and he was hoping i will come back with her. i reached the hospital but i was denied to go in her ward as nurses claimed there was an emergency, they were running up and down. i was shocked but i heard to wait. i went in later and found her fainted, only to be told she was dead. i screamed everywhere feeling like this has happened due hospital recklessness, my second came and when she heard the news was so shocked, we all cried. we later went home only to find there father waiting for us unaware of what had happened. we told him, their younger brother was also told what had happened. the whole family started moarning. we sent the brother to their aunts place, he found them out doing there daily chore, they were happy to see him as they were expecting good news, probably she has been discharged only for them to see the sadness on his face and they knew all was not well, they were told the news and all became sad
