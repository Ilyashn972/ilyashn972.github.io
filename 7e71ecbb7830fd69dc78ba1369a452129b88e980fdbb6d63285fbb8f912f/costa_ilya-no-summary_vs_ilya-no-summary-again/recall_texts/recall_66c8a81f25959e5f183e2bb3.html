  <h2>Original recall (ilya-no-summary)</h2>
  <pre>
Mrs Costa&#x27;s daughter Marie died 28 years ago after an operation for appendicitis . I was a shock as she seemed to be recovered and Mrs Costa was going to collet her with some clothes. She left Rita, her other daughter cooking and making coffee ready for their return. Her husband Mike was coming home, after shaving he sat on the step to wait. At the hospital Mrs Costa was waiting when all the alarms sounded and to her dismay it was for her daughter. Marie died and Mrs Costa was naturally hysterical. She went home and when she told her husband Mike and son Michael they both had heart attacks. Rita still gets a pain in her leg in sympathy with Marie who died from a similar blood clot. She sent her other son Jamie to inform her sisters of the tragic news. I think she still lives in the same area as the shopkeeper was talking to her about Marie.

I read a story about a woman who unexpectedly lost her daughter following a routine operation. She went to pick her up and wasn’t happy with the way things were going. She went home and had to tell her husband an daughter who were waiting at home. The daughter was completing the meal. The husband was so shocked by the news that he died. The daughter has a sympathetic leg problem. The auntie was also involved although I can’t remember how.
