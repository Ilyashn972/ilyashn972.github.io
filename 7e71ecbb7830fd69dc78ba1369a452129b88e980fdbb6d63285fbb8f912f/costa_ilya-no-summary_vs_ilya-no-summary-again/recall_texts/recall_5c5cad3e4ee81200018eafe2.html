  <h2>Original recall (ilya-no-summary)</h2>
  <pre>
Mrs Costa had a daughter who was in the hospital who had gone in for an operation for appendicitis. The day after the operation her other daughter went to see how Marie was but she was still under the effects of anaesthetic. But the nurses were trying to get her out of bed because the doctors had told them to do so. Then she seemed to get a blood clot but they wanted to discharge her. Back at home Mrs Costa was cooking and making coffee and getting clothes ready to take to the hospital for her discharge. She went to the hospital but when she got there her daughter had died. She was angry and upset and praying and being annoyed with the nurses for killing her daughter. She was hysterical at the hospital shouting at the doctors and nurses that they had killed her daughter.. 

Back at home she was still hysterical but told her son to tell the aunties that Marie had died but he was very upset and crying and didn&#x27;t want to go and see them but he did and they were all in shock at the news, even people in the neighborhood or the store. They reminisced about Marie when she was young and playing at the store.

I think the lady&#x27;s name was Mrs Costa and her daughter was in hospital to have an operation. She went to see her the day after the operation but her daughter was still dozy from the anaesthetic and wanted to stay in bed. But the doctor said she needed to get up and walk about. They tried to get her to get up so they could discharge her. Mrs Costa went home to get her some clothes to wear for when they did discharge her but when she went back her daughter had died. I think it was because she got a blood clot through not getting up and walking about so that wouldn&#x27;t happen.

Mrs Costa was very angry and shouting and accused the hospital of killing her daughter. She went home and had to tell the family that her daughter had died unexpectedly but so was so upset that she couldn&#x27;t go and tell them so she got her son to do it instead. He told everyone he could think of and many people started remembering her when she was young and used to play in the street
