  <h2>Original recall (ilya-no-summary)</h2>
  <pre>
I went to the hospital to see my daughter Marie, it was the 28th of the month, she had been very sick and the doctors didn&#x27;t know what was wrong with her, they said to me Mrs Costa we are not sure what is wrong with your daughter. She then started to get better and they said she could come home, I took her nice dress and clothes for her to come home in, there was a chair in front of her bed and I asked why it was there and they said she needed to sit in it. They  tried to put her in the seat but she collapsed, I left the room and when I went back in she was on the bed, they said she had a cold chill and I noticed sweat on her giant sweat balls, I said you have killed her, she was so cold. They tried to get her up but she collapsed on the floor, it was a marble floor and she just lay there and they said she was dead. I asked how it could have happened and they said it was a blood clot in her leg, she was only 18 years old. You killed her I screamed, I screamed it at the nurses and doctors, You Killed her, over and over again. Her brother Michael turned up and I said Michael they killed her, He said No, We have prepared her room at home. Her father had been working down the garden but had also come to the hospital. He said he needed to tell Auntie Jenny and Auntie Millie. The whole town had heard that Marie had died, she was only 18 and had died on the 30 no 28 years ago. Michael had also died as had his Dad.

  <h2>Again recall (ilya-no-summary-again)</h2>
  <pre>
A lady lost her daughter, I believe she had a brother called Michael and she asked Michael but he could not help. She then asked other people but none of them knew where she was. I can remember certain bits being repeated but cannot remember what they were. I cannot remember much more about it which is quite embarrassing.
