A young girl by the name of Marrie was hospitalised due to sickness. I cannot remember the details of the sickness. The girl was taken for medical procedure. After the procedure, her sister went to visit her. However, she was still sedated. The was a chair in the room and the sister asked reason for the chair. The nurse said they need to out Marrie in the chair as per Doctors orders. Marrie&#x27;s sister insisted that she must be left alone as she was still sedated. The hospital forced and a blood clot developed in Marrie&#x27;s body and it was not noticed. 

Marrie&#x27;s mother did not have a phone. Few days later, the hospital called the store near Marie&#x27;s to request Marie&#x27;s mother to come to the hospital as Marire&#x27;s was being discharged. Mother went to the hospital. While mopther is in hospital, confusion happed where hospital thought mother has not yet arrived to collect Marrie. While mohter is waiting, Marrie went on a work with hospital friend. Marrie said goodbye to the friend as she was feeling pain in her leg which turns out to be the clot that developed when she was moved to a chair while sedated. Unfortunately, she passed away. 

The mother was furios, angry and broken and requested that hospital staff must not touch her daughter or else she will kill them. Marrie&#x27;s sister and father also got hurt so bad by the incident.
