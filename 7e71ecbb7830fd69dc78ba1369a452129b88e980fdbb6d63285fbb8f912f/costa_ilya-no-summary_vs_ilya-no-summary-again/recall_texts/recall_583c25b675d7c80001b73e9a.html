  <h2>Original recall (ilya-no-summary)</h2>
  <pre>
The woman (Mrs Costa) was recounting how her daughter (Marie) died after with a blood clot after an operation for appendicitis 28 years ago. She blamed the hospital and doctors for moving her daughter which lead to the blood clot, something about moving her to a chair to start with and then something later on about Marie walking with someone and saying she couldn&#x27;t see properly and her leg hurt. 
She got the call at home to come and pick her up so told her daughter Rita that she was going to pick her up. When she got there she was told to sit and wait and overheard something about another woman who had young daughters who was sick and she was praying for her. A nurse got a call and came and asked if her daughter had a history of fainting, they went to the room and her daughter was covered in sweat and she started yelling at the staff, her daughter passed away just before or after a doctor came in which she accused them of killing her daughter.
The mother was overwhelmed and freaked out to the point of banging her head against the wall and they wanted to give her a shot to calm her down and she accused them of wanting to kill her, and mentioned something about having a few operations (3?) that year so the staff knew her.
Rita came and was told and she dropped to the ground, which was explicitly mentioned as marble. Then they made her way home with her husband and mentioned that her husband died of a heart attack and also I think her brother but timeline is unclear on that. Her brother in law was an undertaker and she tried to call but couldn&#x27;t get a hold of him so she sent her young son, and Mrs Costa&#x27;s sister and I think sister in law thought the son was coming to say that Marie was home, but then they noticed the son&#x27;s eyes were red.
Then it became a lot more rambling and I think it was a shopkeeper she had a conversation with about her daughter and that she was quiet and used to sit on the steps or something. That&#x27;s about all I remember

  <h2>Again recall (ilya-no-summary-again)</h2>
  <pre>
The woman was recounting in a very rambling and unnecessarily detailed way how her daughter had died from a blood clot after an operation for appendicitis and how it was the hospitals fault making her stand up and walk around. She started out being specific with dates, I think 28 years ago when her daughter died. 

She was at home and got a call while she was with her other daughter who was baking something, and was told she could come and pick her daughter up from the hospital. 
She got to the hospital and was told to take a seat, she recounted something about a friend or friends child who was in the hospital, she heard an emergency being called which I think prompted that, then a nurse asked her if her child had previously had any fainting spells or other medical problems. They made it to the woman&#x27;s daughters room and during that time her daughter passed away. The woman became inconsolable and blaming the hospital for the death of her child to the point where they wanted to sedate her, she mentioned that they were trying to kill her like they did her daughter and other irrational things. The woman mentioned that she&#x27;d been in the hospital a number of times herself to the extent where she knew the staff and they her.

She recalled she got home and then launched into a thing saying things about how her husband and brother both died of heart attacks but didn&#x27;t clarify until later in the rambling that it was much later on when in the initial context sounded like it was around the same time. 
Her young son met her when she got home where she told him the news and to go to her sister, the child&#x27;s uncle or aunt, who&#x27;s partner was either an undertaker or mortician, and recounted how the male wasn&#x27;t there and how the woman and another woman there thought he was coming to tell them his sister was home from the hospital. 

Then she started talking about her daughter and her attributes, and how she went to the shops and spoke to the person behind the counter, and how her daughter who&#x27;d passed would sit at the steps. 

This is about the extent I remember!
