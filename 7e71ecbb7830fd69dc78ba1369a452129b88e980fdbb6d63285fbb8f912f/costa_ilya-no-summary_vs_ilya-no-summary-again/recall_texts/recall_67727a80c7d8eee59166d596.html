She then got the call to come and pick her up but they didn&#x27;t have a phone so the hospital call the local store to pass the message on.

The mum didn&#x27;t receive a call all day and the hospital could not get hold of her so they rang the local bar in the town and the woman behind the bar pass the message on to the mother that she need to go to the hospital. When she got to the hospital she was told that her daughter had died, she was distraught and collapsed on the floor say she wanted to see her and this couldn&#x27;t be true.
