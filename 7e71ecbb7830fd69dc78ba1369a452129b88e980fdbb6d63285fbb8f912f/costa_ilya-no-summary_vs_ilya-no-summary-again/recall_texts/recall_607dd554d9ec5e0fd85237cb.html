  <h2>Original recall (ilya-no-summary)</h2>
  <pre>
Mrs. Costa&#x27;s daughter, Marie, died 28 years ago. She had gone to the hospital for an appendectomy. Mrs. Costa had waited for the call to pick her up after 10 days. When she got to the hospital she waited and then the nurses took her into the room and Marie was in a cold sweat. Mrs. Costa was hysterical, screaming and such. They took her to the office and attempted to administer some medication to calm her down but she refused and threatened the hospital workers, she threatened to burn down the hospital. 

Eventually they took her home, she was screaming on the car ride home and in the driveway. The neighbors were coming out because they heard all of the screaming. Marie&#x27;s father had been waiting on the step for her to arrive home with Mrs. Costa, but when he heard that Marie had died he had a heart attack. Marie&#x27;s brother also had a heart attack. 

The youngest boy was sent to inform Mrs. Costa&#x27;s sisters. Later it was confirmed that Marie had complained of a pain in her leg and loss of vision while she was saying goodbye to other patients, it turns out she had a blood clot.

  <h2>Again recall (ilya-no-summary-again)</h2>
  <pre>
I remember that a woman had lost her daughter. They had taken her to a psychiatric hospital and when she was due to be released the mother used a neighbor&#x27;s phone to call and they indicated that the daughter was ready to be picked up. When the mother arrived, they asked her to sit down and explained that the daughter had died, apparently from a fall. The mother went home and found the brother sitting on the front porch, he was given the news and was told to go tell another family member while the mother waited for the father to arrive home from work. Neighbors noticed and came out to give condolences.
