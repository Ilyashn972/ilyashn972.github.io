  <h2>Original recall (ilya-no-summary)</h2>
  <pre>
The story was about the death of mrs costa&#x27;s daughter marie, who died 28 years back of blood cloth resulting from surgeries treating her of injuries she had from an accident. Mrs costa had previously had 3 different operations in the same hospitals and knew the nurses there. She was so distraught by the death of marie that her daughter came looking for her at the hospital with her son in law. She refused taking shots from the doctors because she blames them of her daughters death, &quot;get out&quot; was her response. when she told her husband of marie&#x27;s death, he had a heart attack, same with her son too, her daughter fell at the hospital, a fall that affected her leg. She would have called her brother inlaw who was an undertaker but he passed
