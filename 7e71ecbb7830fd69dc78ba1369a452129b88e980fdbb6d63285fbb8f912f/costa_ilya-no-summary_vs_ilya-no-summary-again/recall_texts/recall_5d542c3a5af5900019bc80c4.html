  <h2>Original recall (ilya-no-summary)</h2>
  <pre>
Mrs Costa&#x27;s daughter, Marie, died about 38 years ago. She had had an operation in April for appendicitis and made a good recovery but died 10 days later. It was the day she was being discharged and she had her housecoat on. The Methodist hospital had rung the local shop to let them know Marie was ready to be discharged as the Costa&#x27;s didn&#x27;t have a home phone. Mrs Costa had to pay an extra $10 for her board. Mrs Costa told her other daughter to have coffee ready for them when they got back from the hospital. Mrs Costa;s sister had bought Marie an orange for when she got home. 
When Mrs Costa got to the hospital there was a delay and she wondered what was going on. The hospital kept ringing the shop to tell them to tell mrs costa to pick up Marie but the shop lady said she had already left. Eventually a nurse told Mrs Costa that there was a problem. She ran down the corridor and and saw Marie on the bed. She was covered in sweat. She had been walking down the corridor with a friend and told her she had a pain in her leg and couldn&#x27;t see, then she collapsed. Mrs Costa was distraught and tore her hair out of its style. WHen she got home she told her husband and son Michael They both had heart attacks
The shop lady still talks about Marie and how lovely she was

The woman was telling the story of how her daughter had died. This was a long time ago, over 20 years I think. Her daughter had been in hospital for an operation. The family didn&#x27;t have a phone so they rang the local shop instead, to pass on the message that she was ready to be discharged. Her mother went in to collect her. She was in the waiting room when she saw a commotion and lots of nurses running around. No one was paying her any attention. In the end she ran down the corridor into her daughters room and saw her daughter lying dead on the bed. The doctors told her her daughter had just been walking down the corridor with a friend when she suddenly collapsed. There were no warning signs. 

I think the girl had a blood clot that killed her instantly. She had been in hospital for a couple of weeks

The womans husband died young because of it, I think it was heart related. 

The woman had to get her young son or nephew to tell the other relatives. 

There was something about asking someone else in the house to make a fresh pot of coffee, as her daughter had been looking forward to that.
