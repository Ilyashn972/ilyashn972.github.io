  <h2>Original recall (ilya-no-summary)</h2>
  <pre>
Marie died twenty seven years ago in hospital. She had gone into hospital with appendicits. Her family went home to get her clothes to wait on the phone call to come and get her. The dad had a wash and a shave while the mother took the clothes and went to the hospital. When she got their the nurse wanted her help to put Marie in a chair which the mum couldn&#x27;t understand but it had been the doctors orders. Marie had been talking to someone else in the hospital when she said she had a pain in her leg and she couldn&#x27;t see. The nurse then told the mum that Maria was dead, the mum started screaming and told them not to touch her. The staff knew Maries mum as she had previously had three operations there. They tried to get the mum to calm down and to sedate her but they couldn&#x27;t and they gave her a lift home while she screamed. The mum told her other daughter who got really upset then she told Mike and her husband who both had heart attacks. She sent her young son Jamie to her two sisters houses who wanted to know when Marie was home as they wanted to be there and had bought her a strange orange. Jamie had to tell them both that Marie had died.
