  <h2>Original recall (ilya-no-summary)</h2>
  <pre>
Mrs Costa recalls the day her daughter Marie died, she had gone in for an operation and was given Ether as an anaesthetic. Mrs Costa had waited to get the call from the hospital to come and pick her daughter a store as she did not have a phone then. When she got the call, she went to the hospital and was told to wait by a nurse. After waiting a while a nurse came to ask her if her daughter had had fainting spells before, and then Mrs Costa asked if the reason they were running about frantically was because of Marie to which the nurse confirmed. She rushed into the room and saw Marie sweating heavily, and then the doctor came in, a lady, she was the assistant to the doctor that usually showed up. They did their best but Marie died, and Mrs Costa became hysterical, pulling her hair and screaming, they tried to give her something but she angrily refused, she knew all the nurses by name because she had had three operations that year. Back home her husband had asked about her and her other daughter Rita had explained that she got the call, Rita went to the hospital and got the news and she fainted, when they got home, she told her husband Mike what had happened and he had a heart attack, their son Mike came around, and when he heard the news, he also had a heart attack. Her sisters Millie and Jennie had been waiting for Marie&#x27;s return, so she sent her son Jamie to go tell them what happened. It was discovered that a blood clot was the cause of Marie&#x27;s death.

her daughter had gone in for a procedure, but there was a mistake in the anaesthetic used, she knew she was supposed to take her home that day but they did not have a phone so she gave the hospital the number of a nearby shop, when she got to the hospital she was asked to wait, then she noticed the nurses seemed to be in panic, and she asked if the reason they were running about frantically was her daughter? She got the news from a female doctor that her daughter had died, it was not the doctor she usually saw (that doctor was male). Her husband had gotten home and was expecting her to be home with their daughter, after a while he sent their youngest daughter to the hospital, she got there found out the truth and fainted. A nurse came to try and calm the mother down but she threatened her, she knew all of them by name as she had been in and out of that hospital that year. They got back home and told the father and he had a heart attack, their oldest son came and he too had a heart attack after hearing what had happened, she sent her young son to her sisters who had been planning a welcome party for the daughter.
