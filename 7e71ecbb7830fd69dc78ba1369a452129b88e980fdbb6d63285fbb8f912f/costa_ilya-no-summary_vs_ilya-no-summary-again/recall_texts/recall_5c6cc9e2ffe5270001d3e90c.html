  <h2>Original recall (ilya-no-summary)</h2>
  <pre>
My daughter died 28 years ago. On the 30th of April. My daughter Rita went to the hospital to see Marie and there was a chair at the foot of the bed. She asked the nurses why there was a chair there. They said that Marie would have to sit on it. Marie had blood clots in her leg. She was eighteen. Someone who called me &#x27;Mrs Costa&#x27; called me and told me to go to the hospital. I had the coat and Marie&#x27;s dress on my arm. The nurses told me Marie had collapsed. I told them that they killed her and that I&#x27;d burn the hospital down. Rita came in and collapsed, fell down like lightning. The back of her leg was hard as a pole. She had phlebitis. My husband was sat on the step outside our home. My face was a mess and I was screaming. Everyone came out their doors because of the noise. &#x27;What happened?&#x27;, he asked. &#x27;Marie, she&#x27;s gone. She&#x27;s dead.&#x27; He had a heart attack. I told my son Michael and he had a heart attack too. I told my other son Jamie to go and tell his two aunts. There was a girl called Millie who was a very nice girl.

My daughter died at 28 years old in April. Her sister was in the hospital with her and asked the nurses why the chair was placed there. They said they needed her to sit on the chair to avoid blood clotting. I got a call that my daughter had died and I went to the hospital. I got very angry with the staff and was shouting at them. My other daughter came running in and collapsed on the floor. When we went home, my husband was sat on the steps outside. I told him that our daughter had died. We went inside and told our son to go to his aunts and tell them what happened. There was a coat hanging on the back of a chair and I told my husband to take it.
