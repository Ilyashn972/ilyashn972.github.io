  <h2>Original recall (ilya-no-summary)</h2>
  <pre>
It was 28 years ago that my daughter died. My daughter Victoria is here. My daughter died on the 30th of April. Or 20th. It was ten days before. We were eager to see Marie as she collapsed on the ground one day and she was taken to a hospital. When doctor called to say to come in I was ready to do it and I told one of my daughters to stop cooking and I took a dress, Millies dress so that I could bring it to the hospital. Dad was also happy to go to hospital but he was busy. I have a few daughters. And Aunt Milly is also my relative. I also have a son in law. So I was eager to see Marie and I went to the hospital. I knew there was a lady in there who had gallblader problems and she was dying too. I saw my daughter with pearls of sweat on her head and her leg was like a pole, she was dead and I screamed no you killed her to the doctors but people kept trying to calm me. I was in shock and I screamed in my car and I kept saying no it cant happen, she is dead and they killed her. I called dad and explained it, he was so ready to see her and Rita as well and son in law. But she was dead and it turns out she had a blood clot in her leg which is why her leg was like a pole. My daughter Marie was dead and she was only 18 years old. I was devastated and I didnt let them touch my Marie as I did not want anyone to do anything to her more. I brought her dress but she was dead. Then after hearing it from me dad had a heart attack and my husband died from a heart attack. I could not believe it. Thats the story.

It is me Laura, my other daughter and myself, mom, here pondering. The memories come back. Fifteen years ago my daughter collapsed one day. She collapsed on the floor and we took her to a hospital. At the hospital she was very frail, sickly. I cried and went back home to find my husband asking what happened and I explained the story. Cousins also got very confused and wanted to see her at the hospital. I decided to visit her at the hospital. I called Laura and she said to take a scarf to my sick daughter so I looked for it in the closet. I found a red scarf that she likes and so I went to the hospital with family to visit her. Husband was on the phone, he did not hear what I said about going there. When I went to the hospital I went into her room and there was another sick lady laying on the bed. She had dementia. There was my daughter laying in bed. The doctor came in and told us she has cancer and I collapsed to the floor screaming from terror. Doctor said there was nothing they could do. I cried and I held my daughter, I was very upset and it was the worst thing that could happen to a mother. My daughter was dying. I remember this day vividly. My daughter was so beautiful and had long hair. After she died me and Laura remembered her together, its like it happened yesterday and I remember every detail.
