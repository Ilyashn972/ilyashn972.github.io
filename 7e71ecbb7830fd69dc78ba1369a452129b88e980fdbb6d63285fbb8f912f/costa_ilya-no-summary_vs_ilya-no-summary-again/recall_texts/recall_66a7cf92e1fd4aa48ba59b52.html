  <h2>Original recall (ilya-no-summary)</h2>
  <pre>
the story is a sad and heartbreaking one. was about a young lady Marie, a 28 year old, she died very close to her birthday. after staying a while in the hospital, everyone was expecting her return, a small party was likely gonna happened, but unfortunately, she died instead of getting discharged. The news shocked everyone. Her father and brother had instant heart attack when the news broke. Call wasn&#x27;t made to Marie&#x27;s aunt, young Jammie was sent, aunt was excited to see him, until she had a close look at him to realize his eyes were red from crying. Mrs Costa, Marie&#x27;s mom was quiet popular in the neighbourhood, so is Marie, even though she a calm, quiet and easy going young lady. Mrs Costa doesn&#x27;t have a phone, she got the call from a lady at the store at about a quarter to five in the night that Marie is getting discharged and she should pick her up.Rita was cooking and was told to finish ASAP. Mrs Costa ordered that coffee be made for Marie because she had long wished for it, cake was also ordered for from the bakery. Mrs Costa got really emotional at the hospital, accusing the doctors, nurses and aides of killing her daughter. she was a regular service user in the hospital, typically knows most of the staff there. she believed the blood clot her daughter had was the hospital&#x27;s mistake.she was mad when  her daughter was about to be moved out of bed, she told them she is too sick and still under ether, but the nurse responded that it was the doctors&#x27; instruction she had to follow, even though they had to put her back on bed after she passed away
