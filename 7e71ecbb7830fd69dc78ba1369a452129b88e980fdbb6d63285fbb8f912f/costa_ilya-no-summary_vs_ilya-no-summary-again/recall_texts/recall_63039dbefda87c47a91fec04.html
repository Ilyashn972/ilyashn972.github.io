The story was about someone in the hospital and the doctors may have misdiagnosed. The daughter liked coffee a lot. Something about a family member owning a Funeral Home and the Kid telling the family about the daughter. The parent was upset at the doctor and the daughter was in bed sweating or something. The daughter was prepared to come home.
