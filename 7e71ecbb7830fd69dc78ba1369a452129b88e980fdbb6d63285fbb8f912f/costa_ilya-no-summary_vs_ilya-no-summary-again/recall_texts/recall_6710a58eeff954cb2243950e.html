  <h2>Original recall (ilya-no-summary)</h2>
  <pre>
Mrs Costa lost her daughter Marie twenty eight years ago on 30th of April, ten days after an operation which took place in the night at Methodist Hospital. She was sedated with ether, which was used in operation at that time. While she was recovering gradually, her sister Veronica came over to visit her, but she was still sedated and was lying in bed. However, one the nurses insisted that she should be out of bed and made her. This caused Marie to collapse and had to put her back in bed. Mrs Costa was able to go home for a while. She did not have a phone in those days, so uses the Annie the shopkeeper&#x27;s phone for the hospital to get in touch. One day, the hospital called to tell her Marie has been discharged, so she should go pick her up. Then she began to take Marie&#x27;s dress and coat to take to the hospital. On arrival, she was informed that Marie had died, having collapsed due to blood clot.She was only thirteen years old. Mrs Costa lost it completely and accused all the medical staff of killing her daughter. One of her daughters, Rita, whom she left at home waited impatiently for their arrival and when it was not forthcoming, she headed to the hospital only to be told that her sister has died and she too lost it. Then they had to drive home to inform Marie&#x27;s dad, Mike who was sitting on a step and her other siblings that she has died. On arrival back home, Mrs Costa was screaming to loud that the neighbours came out to find out what happened and were sad that Marie had died. When Mike was was informed of his daughter&#x27;s death, he had a heart attack, which happened to his son Michael as well. The younger son Jamie was sent go inform their two Aunts - Jenny and Millie that their niece had died. The Aunts have preparing and looking forward to Marie&#x27;s arrival back home, so they were shocked to discover she had passed. Mrs Costa also informed her brother-in-law, who has since passed and was an undertaker.

I think I remember her daughter was hospitalised and the plan was for her to be discharged. Then it was discovered that she collapsed while she was about to get up from the bed. Meanwhile her mother was already planning her homecoming and was making her way to the hospital to collect her daughter. Unfortunately, her daughter died shortly after she got to the hospital and being overcome with grief, she blamed all the hospital staff for her loss.
