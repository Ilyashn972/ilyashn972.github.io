  <h2>Original recall (ilya-no-summary)</h2>
  <pre>
Mrs. Costa lost her daughter Marie 30 years ago this April. She got a blood clot after an appendisitis operation. Mrs. Costa went to the hospital to pick up her daughter, she had marie&#x27;s dress and coat hanging on her arm. She was sitting in the hospital waiting and she was praying for a mother of 10 to survive. Mrs. Costa had had 3 surgeries in one year so she Knew everyone at this hospital.  Then the nurse came in for a blanket and she asked &quot;Are you rushing for my daughter?&quot; and the nurse said you can talk to her. Marie had huge beads of sweat and was unconscious. They made marie walk after her surgery while she was still under the Ether. &quot;Why is this chair here?&quot; Mrs. Costa asked, and was told the Doctor ordered it becasue they wanted Marie to walk but that caused the blood clot.  Mrs. Costa&#x27;s other daughter Rita told everyone what happened. Before she left, she told her to put a pot of coffee, every morning she had and brought that first cup to her daughter. Her husband  Mike was waiting on the steps for Mrs. Costa to get back and when she got back he said, &quot;What happened to you.&quot; Her hair was all pulled and her face was a mess because she was distraught at the hospital, screaming, &quot;You killed my daughter&quot;. Mrs. Costa had her sons, Michael and James tell the relatives about the death of Marie. One had red eyes and Aunt Milly and Aunt Jenny asked him why he was crying and he said, &quot;Marie is dead.&quot;

I think I might vaguely remember reading a story about a woman who lost her daughter but that&#x27;s all I remember, if that.  I have no memory of the details, the location, the tone or anything.  This worries me because I thought I had a good memory...I have so much confidence in my memory that I&#x27;m wondering if the experiment is to see if I will make up a fake memory.
