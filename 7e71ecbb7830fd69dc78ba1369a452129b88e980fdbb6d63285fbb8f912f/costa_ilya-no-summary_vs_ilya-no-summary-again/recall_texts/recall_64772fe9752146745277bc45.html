  <h2>Original recall (ilya-no-summary)</h2>
  <pre>
twenty eight years ago Mrs Costa&#x27;s daughter marie died.  she blamed the hospital because they got her out of bed while she was still in etha. there was a chair and when mrs costa asked why there was a chair they said she had collapsed after they got her out of bed.  i asked why they got her out of bed as she was still sick. she got her dress and coat to take to the hospital after they called her to be collected.  she put a big pot of coffee on ready for marie to come home as she mentioned she wanted coffee.  she told her son to keep the dinner ready for her husband who will be home soon.  when he got home he went upstairs to change and shave and waited on the step.  when she got to the hospital, marie was waving at the window and then went to say her goodbyes to everyone.  Mrs Costa had had 3 operations in a year at the hospital.  she was praying for a neighbour who was just about to have an operation.  she had a large family.  when she got in the hospital the nurses were there to explain her daughter was dying.. mrs costa lost control and shouted at the nurses and doctors that they had killed her.  they wanted to know how marie had died but mrs costa told them if they touched her daughter she would kill them and burn down the hospital not caring who was inside.   when she saw her daughter who had died she had large beads of sweat on her.  her leg was solid.  they think she had a blood clot.  mrs costa was histerical and her hair was pulled out and her face was a mess.  when she went home her husband asked her what was wrong and when she told him their daughter was dead he had a heart attack.  her son went to mrs costas 2 sisters to tell the news, he was upset and teary eyed.  her 2 sisters came over, one had the largest orange she had ever seen.
