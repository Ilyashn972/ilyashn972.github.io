Mrs Costa had a daughter called Marie, Marie had been in hospital and was due to be discharged. On the day she was being dishcarged Mrs Costa went to the hospital, she had packed her bag and when she got to the hospital Marie was on the bed. There was a nurse aid and a doctor, she was a female doctor. They asked if Mrs Costa had ever had fainting spells. Then the doctors were running. It was Marie. When Mrs Costa went into the room Marie was on the bed and had large beads of sweat dripping down her face. Mrs Costa got very angry and could see that Marie was very unwell. She accused the hospital of killing her daughter. The female doctor tried to calm her down and give her a shot but she refused, she just kept yelling that she had killer her daughter. When Mrs Costa left the hospital hadnt told the admin team about what happened so they kept calling her at the shop asking if she had been to pick Marie up yet. She went back to the hospital and was shouting at them, she was pulling her hair up. When she went back home she sat on the step and told her husband what happened and he had a heart attack. There son Michael then came home and they told him about Marie and he also had a heart attack. Mrs Costa had two sisters and there other son went to there house to tell them what happened. They had assumed that they were there to tell them Marie was home as they had all been waiting for her to be discharged but he told them she had died.
