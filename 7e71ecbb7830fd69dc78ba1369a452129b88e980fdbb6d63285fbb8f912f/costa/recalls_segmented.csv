0,7,because she was under ether.

0,9,and not to move her.
0,10,"They tried to move her anyway,"
0,11,"and when they did,"
0,12,she collapsed.
0,13,She probably got a blood clot from it
0,14,because they were talking about what could've caused it.
0,15,"I still remember that day,"
0,16,I was at home
0,17,and they called me to say that Marie was being discharged from the hospital.
0,18,I had all the clothes laid out on the table.
0,19,My husband was at work.
0,20,I went there

0,23,to not take away this mother from her daughters.
0,24,I saw a nurse running
0,25,and she came and asked me something.
0,26,"I asked her if she was running for my daughter,"

0,28,I went in
0,29,and saw my daughter sweating.

0,33,who performed the surgery came to speak to me.
0,34,"I screamed very loudly,"
0,35,they wanted to inject me with something.
0,36,"I told them ""You killed my daughter and now you want to kill me."""

0,39,My daughter told them that I had already left for the hospital.
0,40,They all came quickly because they were worried about me.
0,41,They took me back home.
0,42,"I started screaming when we reached home,"
0,43,I was still in the car.
0,44,People were coming out of their homes
0,45,to check what was going on.
0,46,"I kept screaming ""They killed her!""."
0,47,"My husband was sitting on the porch,"
0,48,and he asked me what was going on.
0,49,"I told him ""Marie is dead, they killed her."""
0,50,"I showed them pictures of my daughter,"
0,51,she was only eighteen.
0,52,"When her sister and my husband found out,"
0,53,they collapsed.
0,54,I told my youngest son
0,55,to go and tell my sisters Auntie Jenny and Auntie Millie what had happened.
0,56,"When he went to tell them what had happened,"
0,57,they thought he was coming to tell them that Marie had come back home
0,58,"but when they found out,"
0,59,they were shocked.
0,60,"My sister brought an orange earlier,"
0,61,"a big orange,"
0,62,nothing like I had ever seen before.
0,63,"The local store owner praised Marie a lot,"
0,64,she said that Marie would always come to the store
0,65,"and stand there,"
0,66,pointing at the steps.
0,67,"""She would always stand there and look over"","
0,68,"She was a quiet girl,"
0,69,not much to talk.
0,70,"She was a good girl,"
0,71,Marie.

1,2,to the unexpected death
1,3,of her daughter Marie.
1,4,She passed suddenly
1,5,from a blood clot
1,6,in her leg.
1,7,The mother had a breakdown
1,8,"in the hospital,"
1,9,when she got home
1,10,she told her husband and son
1,11,about the sudden passing
1,12,and they both suffered heart attacks.

3,2,It was the thirteenth of the month.
3,3,She was operated on for appendicitis.
3,4,"The next morning, her older sister went to see her in the hospital."
3,5,She was still under ether.
3,6,They used a lot of ether for the operation.
3,7,There was a chair in the room.
3,8,They just started getting people out of bed.
3,9,She asked the nurses.
3,10,"It was the doctor's order, they replied."
3,11,They got her out of bed.
3,12,She suffered a blood clot.
3,13,She was put back to bed again.
3,14,They called us from the hospital.
3,15,They called on a phone in a nearby store.
3,16,We were informed about her discharge.
3,17,Rita was cooking.
3,18,She will finish the cooking.
3,19,Her dad is preparing upstairs.
3,20,He said to prepare coffee for her.

3,24,She was walking.
3,25,She fainted again.
3,26,The nurses were running.
3,27,I asked if they were running for my daughter.
3,28,I saw her on the bed.
3,29,She was in her dress.
3,30,She had her slippers on.
4,1,A girl called Marie died 28 years ago at aged 22 on the 30th of April.
4,2,It was a late Saturday afternoon.
4,3,"Her mother Mrs Costa had gone to collect her from hospital,"
4,4,but had found her soaking in beads of sweat
4,5,and unwell
4,6,and she passed away.
4,7,The doctor had given her too much ether
4,8,and she had pain in her leg
4,9,and could not see
4,10,and this was the blood clot.
4,11,Mrs Costa had been offered a jab to calm her
4,12,upon declaring the hospital had killed her daughter
4,13,and exclaimed the shot would be them trying to kill her also.
4,14,The shocking news spread through the family
4,15,to Mr Costa and her sister first
4,16,then extended family.
5,1,It has been 28 years now since Marie died.
5,2,She had gone to the hospital for surgery for the appendix.
5,3,Her sister went to visit her
5,4,and found a chair in the room
5,5,and asked the nurse what the chair was for
5,6,"and told her that they had to get Marie out of bed,"
5,7,she told her that they can't do that cause Marie is too sick.
5,8,But the nurse told her that it was the Doctor's orders.
5,9,She pulled Marie out of bed
5,10,but she collapsed.
5,11,The mother did not have a phone
5,12,so the hospital called the lady at the store
5,13,to tell Mrs. Costa that she needs to pick up Marie because she is discharged.
5,14,That morning she asked her daughter to put on some coffee for Marie
5,15,because she likes coffee in the morning.
5,16,She laid out Marie's clothes
5,17,and put her coat on her arm
5,18,and headed to the hospital.
5,19,Marie was up and busy saying goodbye to the girls at the hospital
5,20,when her mother got there.
5,21,Then the nurse came
5,22,"and asked Mrs. Costa if her daughter had had fainting spells before,"
5,23,"she asked if she was going to her daughter,"
5,24,when she saw her daughter
5,25,she realized that she was sweating.
5,26,It was a lot of sweat.
5,27,She was still in her house slippers.
5,28,Marie died
5,29,and Mrs. Costa started screaming at the nurse that they had killed her daughter.
5,30,"The female Dr., Dr. Schwartz, had assisted the doctor who did the surgery."
5,31,She came into the room
5,32,and Mrs. Costa shouted at her too.
5,33,The hospital kept calling
5,34,asking for the mother to come pick up Marie.
5,35,Marie's sister figured something was wrong
5,36,and also headed to the hospital.
5,37,She found her mother in the office undone
5,38,and that's when she found out about Marie's.
5,39,She fell and broke her leg.
5,40,They eventually figured that a blot clot was what had killed Marie.
5,41,Back at the house the neighbors were out of their houses
5,42,due to Mrs. Costa's screams from inside the car.
5,43,The husband had been waiting by the step for his daughter's return.
5,44,When he heard the news
5,45,he instantly had a heart attack.
5,46,Their son Michael also had a heart attack the same day after finding out.
5,47,The youngest son was then sent to inform his aunties about the death of his sister Marie.
6,1,A story of a girl named Marie
6,2,"Mrs. Costa, Marie's mom, went to pick up Marie from the hospital"

6,19,don't touch my daughter
6,20,or see I will set this hospital on fire
6,21,Mrs. Costa went home
6,22,and let everyone know what happened
6,23,Everyone’s family member was in shock
6,24,including the neighbours
7,1,The story was honestly somewhat jumbled in its retelling.
7,2,"However, the core of the story was that the woman's daughter, Marie, died."
7,3,She was in the hospital receiving treatment.
7,4,She died.
7,5,The woman telling the story was livid at the experience.
7,6,"She blamed not the doctor, but the doctor's female assistant."
7,7,She thinks that the doctor's female assistant killed her daughter.
7,8,She was completely shocked and angry about it.
8,1,"My daughter died,"
8,2,"it was either March or April 28 years ago,"
8,3,"the daughter was called Marie,"
8,4,she went into hospital for something
8,5,and was due to be discharged.
8,6,"The hospital rang the mother,"
8,7,Mrs. Costa to go and collect her.

8,9,and put some coffee on.
8,10,Marie liked a pot of coffee every morning

8,13,and she realized they were for her daughter
8,14,she was told to talk to her
8,15,and said she was dying
8,16,what was she supposed to say
8,17,and when she died
8,18,she was screaming and kicking
8,19,and pulled out her hair
8,20,and asked what was wrong
8,21,her daughter has just been saying goodbye to Arlene.
8,22,"Also, she had taken her dress and her corsets."
8,23,She asked what had happened
8,24,and they said a blood clot.
8,25,She was screaming so
8,26,they said they'd give her a shot
8,27,and she said they'd killed her daughter
8,28,and they weren't killing her as well.
8,29,She went home
8,30,and the son James was there
8,31,he was only little
8,32,and when she told the Dad
8,33,he had a heart attack and died

9,18,She told her son Jamie
9,19,"to tell her two sisters,"

9,21,that she had died.
10,1,"Mrs. Costa (mom) recalled her experience of losing her daughter, Marie."
10,2,Marie had surgery for appendicitis
10,3,which eventually led to a blood clot
10,4,and then her death.
10,5,Mrs. Costa was remembering the experience
10,6,"which occurred 28 years earlier,"
10,7,in the month of April.
10,8,She was called to come and pick up her daughter from the hospital
10,9,"after she was being discharged,"
10,10,"but when she got there,"
10,11,she was told by the nurses to sit and wait.
10,12,"Eventually, they told the mom that Marie had broken out into cold sweats"
10,13,and was waiting to be seen by the doctor.
10,14,Marie eventually died in the hospital.
10,15,"Mrs. Costa went hysterical,"
10,16,"as any mother would,"
10,17,trying to figure out what had happened
10,18,while emotions were incredibly high.
10,19,"Eventually, Mrs. Costa had to break the news to her family"
10,20,once she was able to get home.
10,21,The news of Marie's death caused Mr. Costa and Marie's brother
10,22,to both have heart attacks.
11,1,"It is 28 years since the death of Mrs. Costa's daughter, Marie,"
11,2,who died on the 30th of April
11,3,- 10 days after an operation for appendicitis.
11,4,Mrs. Costa's other daughter Veronica had gone to the Methodist Hospital to see how Marie was.
11,5,They were getting her out of bed.
11,6,"The surgeon was Dr. Schwarz,"
11,7,"and his assistant was a female doctor, Dr. Montique."
11,8,"It was time for Marie to come home,"
11,9,"and so Mrs. Costa had gone to the hospital,"
11,10,carrying her coat
11,11,and after her husband had made a coffee.
11,12,"While there,"
11,13,"waiting for Marie,"
11,14,"she said a prayer for a woman she knew,"
11,15,praying that she would survive
11,16,and that her daughter wouldn't be left without a mother.
11,17,"At that time,"
11,18,there was a commotion
11,19,as something had happened to Marie.
11,20,Mrs. Costa went into her room
11,21,"to see her daughter lying there,"
11,22,covered in beads of sweat.
11,23,"""You've killed her,"" Mrs. Costa yelled."
11,24,"""Don't you touch her,"
11,25,or I'll burn this whole hospital down and everyone in it.
11,26,"I know you want to find out why she died, but don't touch her."""
11,27,"It turned out that Mrs. Costa's other daughter Rita had been with her,"
11,28,and Marie had complained that she had a pain in her leg
11,29,and couldn't see
11,30,before collapsing.
11,31,It turned out
11,32,she had died from a blood clot.
11,33,When Rita learned that Marie had died
11,34,"she collapsed to the floor,"
11,35,badly injuring her leg
11,36,which became rigid.
11,37,28 years later
11,38,"and she still suffers extended periods of serious pain in that leg,"
11,39,like phlebitis.
11,40,Mrs. Costa went home
11,41,and informed her husband.
11,42,"He had shaved,"
11,43,and had been sitting on the porch
11,44,immediately suffered a heart attack.
11,45,"When her son Michael found out,"
11,46,he also had a heart attack.
11,47,It was her other son Jamie
11,48,who went to Mrs. Costa's two sisters
11,49,"and her mother,"
11,50,"still alive at the time,"
11,51,arriving with red eyes
11,52,to report that Marie had died.
13,1,The story was about a girl named Marie
13,2,who was 18 years old
13,3,when she passed away.
13,4,Her mother Mrs. Costa was recalling the story of her passing away
13,5,28 years after her death
13,6,on 30th April.
13,7,"The mother seemed to be confused with the dates,"
13,8,so it could either be the 20th of April or the 30th.
13,9,Marie was admitted to the Methodist Hospital
13,10,for some complications.
13,11,Her sister Rita came over to check up on her
13,12,and saw that the hospital was getting ready
13,13,to put her into a chair
13,14,however she passed away
13,15,when they tried to shift her
13,16,so they had to put her back to bed.
13,17,After which they sent everyone back home
13,18,and the doctors checked up on her.
13,19,Then Mrs Costa was at home
13,20,waiting for a call from the hospital
13,21,"and since she didn't have a phone,"
13,22,she was waiting for a shopkeeper around her home
13,23,to tell her
13,24,whenever she got a call from the hospital.
13,25,Then one day she got a call
13,26,from the hospital
13,27,that she had been discharged
13,28,and she could come pick her up
13,29,and extra fees were needed
13,30,"for her boarding charges,"
13,31,which were 10$.
13,32,The mother reached the hospital
13,33,and was praying for another patient
13,34,while waiting in the hospital.
13,35,Then a nurse comes
13,36,and asks her
13,37,if her daughter was prone to fainting spells
13,38,and lead her to a room
13,39,where her daughter was sweating a lot
13,40,and was unconscious.
13,41,The mother broke out in a hysterical fit
13,42,and started crying
13,43,that the hospital killed her
13,44,and she had an unchecked blood clot.
13,45,The doctor came rushing in
13,46,and they had to restrain the mother
13,47,because she tried to harm herself
13,48,and was not able to calm down.
13,49,Her daughter comes in a car
13,50,with her husband
13,51,and the mother delivers her the news
13,52,and she collapses in the hospital.
13,53,The mother then narrated her story
13,54,of how things went down
13,55,after her death was announced
13,56,how her husband and son both got heart attacks
13,57,after listening to the news
13,58,and how everyone else was shocked.
14,1,"Her daughter died in the hospital,"
14,2,"she died at a Methodist hospital,"
14,3,she had an operation for appendicitis on a Saturday.
14,4,"On Sunday his oldest daughter Victoria went to the hospital to check up on her,"
14,5,she was still under ether.
14,6,"She saw a chair and asked the nurse what the chair was for,"
14,7,"the nurse explained that they had to get her out of bed,"
14,8,"the older daughter was furious because her sister was still under ether,"
14,9,"but the nurse reiterated that it was the doctor's orders,"
14,10,"they went to get her out of bed,"
14,11,but she was passed out.
14,12,"She believed the blood clot she had was their fault for taking her out of bed,"
14,13,"later the hospital called for her to go pick up Marie,"
14,14,that she had been discharged.
14,15,He told Rita she was going to pick Marie from the hospital.
14,16,"When she got there the nurse told her to sit down,"
14,17,she started praying for another patient that had an operation because she was a mother of ten.
14,18,"The nurse asked her if her daughter had ever gotten a fainting spell,"
14,19,"when she stepped in she yelled,"
14,20,"you killed my daughter a couple times,"
14,21,"the doctor who was a lady rushed in and said we don't know what happened,"
14,22,her daughter passed away in front of her eyes.
14,23,"Rita was bothered, so she came over with her son-in-law,"
14,24,"but due to her acting hysterical she was held down,"
14,25,"she then broke the news of Marie's passing to Rita,"
14,26,she was taken home.
14,27,Mike had a heart attack once the news was broken to him.
14,28,Her younger sister had brought an orange for Marie earlier.
14,29,James was sent to break the news to Aunt Jennie.
15,1,"A woman recounts the passing of her daughter, Marie."

15,3,It happened on April the 20th.
15,4,Marie was in hospital.
15,5,She was having an operation to treat appendicitis.
15,6,A nurse tried to move her out of a bed into a chair.
15,7,"However, she was heavily sedated on Ether."
15,8,She passed out whilst they were attempting to move her.
15,9,They were forced to put her back into bed.
15,10,The narrator believes this may have been the cause of the blood clot.
15,11,The blood clot resulted in her death.
15,12,The narrator recounts the day in which she was supposed to pick up Marie from the hospital.
15,13,She gathered several of her clothes.
15,14,She gathered a coat.
15,15,She speaks about how they lacked a telephone.
15,16,The local store had agreed to call ahead.
15,17,The store was to let the rest of the family know when Marie had been discharged.
15,18,She arrived at the hospital.
15,19,She sat in a chair.
15,20,She prayed for an elderly woman.
15,21,The elderly woman was also undergoing an operation.
15,22,She noticed several nurses grabbing cold towels.
15,23,She inquired as to where her daughter was.
15,24,She was then asked whether her daughter had a history of fainting.
15,25,Worry began to set in.
15,26,"""What have you done to my daughter?"", she asked."
15,27,She was told to come with the nurse.
15,28,The mother states that the beads of sweat appearing on her daughter's face were very large.
15,29,Seeing this made the narrator lose herself with anguish.
15,30,She shouted at the nurses.
15,31,She shouted at the doctors.
15,32,She said that they had 'killed her daughter'.
15,33,"Shortly after, as she turned her back, Marie died."
15,34,The narrator had torn her own hair out.
15,35,She was still shouting.
15,36,She was moved to a waiting area.
15,37,She had refused 'a shot' from a doctor.
15,38,She believed they were going to kill her too.
15,39,"A short time later, another daughter arrived at the hospital."
15,40,The other daughter wanted to see what had held them up.
15,41,The other daughter believed that they should have been home by now.
15,42,When the narrator told her that Marie had died.
15,43,She collapsed to the floor 'like lightning'.
15,44,"Later, the mother describes how she returned home."
15,45,She was screaming from the grief.
15,46,This caused many people to investigate what happened.
15,47,She states that when she told her husband and her son.
15,48,They both had heart attacks.
15,49,"Later, she recounts visiting a store."
15,50,The employee would always remind her of how Marie would use to stand on the step outside.
15,51,Marie was a quiet girl.
15,52,Marie was always kind and good.
16,1,There was a lady
16,2,who had a daughter
16,3,who died of a blood clot.

16,10,and whilst on route

16,12,and some blindness
16,13,then collapsed.

16,15,the daughter had beads of sweat on her
16,16,and she had died on a hospital bed.
16,17,The father was called
16,18,"and tragically,"
16,19,he too had a heart attack

32,10,Mrs Costa was at home.
32,11,Her other daughter Rita was cooking.
32,12,They never had a phone.
32,13,So a store owner they knew was able to call the hospital.
32,14,So they could go and get Marie.

32,16,While Mrs Costa would go to the hospital.
32,17,It had been 10 days.
32,18,Before the 28 April.
32,19,And would have cost $10 more for board.
32,20,When Mrs Costa arrived at the hospital.
32,21,She was praying for the recovery of another woman she knew.
32,22,Who had 10 children.
32,23,When they tried to bring out Marie.
32,24,She went into a cold sweat.
32,25,And fell on the hard marble floor.
32,26,The nurse and doctors tried to save her.
32,27,And asked Mrs Costa to talk to her.
32,28,But she died.
32,29,She was only 18 years old.
32,30,Her husband Mike had also now come to the hospital.
32,31,And he suffered a heart attack.
32,32,At the news Marie had died.
32,33,When Mrs Costa had come out of the hospital.
32,34,The brother Michael also collapsed.
32,35,At the shocking news.
32,36,Sister brought an orange for Marie.
33,1,A woman named Mary has a daughter named Marie
33,2,who was a very good and quiet child
33,3,who went into the hospital for appendicitis.
33,4,"During recovery, she was made to get up from the bed"
33,5,and sit in a chair
33,6,where she fainted
33,7,that caused a blood clot
33,8,that led to her death
33,9,28 years ago on the 30th of April
33,10,when she was only 18 years old.
33,11,Mary did not have a phone at home
33,12,so the woman from the store received the call
33,13,when it was time to retrieve Marie from the hospital.
33,14,But she died
33,15,shortly after she arrived
33,16,after saying goodbye to Arlene and other women at the hospital.
33,17,"Mary became very distraught,"
33,18,screaming and pulling at her hair
33,19,and threatening to kick and kill people
33,20,and burn the hospital to the ground with everyone in it.
33,21,They tried to give her a shot
33,22,"and she wondered if they wanted to kill her, too,"
33,23,after killing her daughter.
33,24,Mary had three surgeries over a short period of time
33,25,at the hospital
33,26,so all of the nurses knew her.
33,27,She was taken home by hospital staff
33,28,and screamed the entire way.
33,29,People came out of their houses to see what the matter was.
33,30,Her husband had come home from work
33,31,to wash and shave
33,32,"and wait for her and Marie to arrive from the hospital,"
33,33,then had a heart attack upon hearing the news.
33,34,Her older son (Michael?) also had a heart attack.
33,35,"Her sisters, Jenny and Millie, were to be there to greet Marie."
33,36,One had brought her a big orange.
33,37,"The youngest son, James, was sent to tell them the news,"
33,38,and arrived with reddened eyes.
34,1,Daughter Marie went to hospital
34,2,for an operation
34,3,for appendicitis.
34,4,She had the operation
34,5,on Saturday afternoon.
34,6,Her sister visited her
34,7,and she was still under ether.
34,8,They tried to get her out of bed
34,9,and mother felt
34,10,it was too soon
34,11,but it was the doctors' order.
34,12,She fainted
34,13,so they put her back to bed.
34,14,"Mrs. Costa, the mother, was called"
34,15,to go to the hospital
34,16,to pick up her daughter
34,17,as she was being discharged.
34,18,She felt
34,19,this was too early
34,20,to be discharged.
34,21,Mrs. Costa went to the hospital
34,22,but when she got there
34,23,[she found out] that her daughter died.
34,24,Mrs. Costa went home
34,25,and told her husband
34,26,who then had a heart attack.
34,27,Son Michael
34,28,also had a heart attack
34,29,at the news.
35,1,"My daughter died twenty eight years ago,"
35,2,on the 13th of April
35,3,on a chilly day.
35,4,She had gone in for surgery on her appendix
35,5,at a hospital
35,6,I had 3 surgeries at in the past.
35,7,"Her sister, Victoria, often went to visit her."
35,8,I was at the store with Rita
35,9,when the hospital called me
35,10,to come and pick her up.
35,11,She had been in hospital for 10 days
35,12,and the nurses took her out of bed
35,13,to ensure she wouldn't get clots.
35,14,Marie had been excited to come home.
35,15,I took her coat with me.
35,16,While I was on my way
35,17,my husband was shaving
35,18,"and getting ready to welcome her home,"
35,19,waiting on the step outside our house for her.
35,20,When I got to the hospital
35,21,"there were doctors and nurses running,"
35,22,a nurse came up to me
35,23,and asked if I was Marie's mother.
35,24,I asked her if all the running was for my daughter
35,25,and they said yes.
35,26,They took me into her room
35,27,"and told me to talk to her,"
35,28,"I said 'what am I meant to say, my daughter is dying.'"
35,29,She passed away soon afterwards
35,30,from a blood clot.
35,31,I was pulling my hair out
35,32,and hitting my head on the wall outside the office.
35,33,They drove me home
35,34,and when I told my husband what had happened
35,35,he had a heart attack.
35,36,My son Michael also came out
35,37,and when I told him
35,38,he had a heart attack too.
35,39,"My nephew, Jamie, was there too"
35,40,and went to tell my sisters and my mother.
35,41,My sister's brother has since passed away.
35,42,Marie was only 18 when she died.
36,1,OK.
36,2,A mother showed up at the hospital
36,3,to take who I believe to be her daughter (Marie) home
36,4,from a hospital stay.
36,5,"Just before she was to take Marie home,"
36,6,Marie died.
36,7,Then the mother went insane
36,8,"threatening to kill people,"
36,9,even threatening to burn the hospital down.
36,10,She then proceeded to inform the immediate family.
36,11,That's the general idea
36,12,as near as I could discern
36,13,from this poorly written hodgepodge of a story.
37,1,The woman from the store called us
37,2,because we didn't have a phone.
37,3,She told us that the hospital called
37,4,— they wanted us to pick Marie up.
37,5,"I told my daughter to put a pot of coffee on,"
37,6,dad would be finished in the yard soon.
37,7,"I always gave Marie the first cup in the morning,"
37,8,I always remember that.
37,9,"Anyway, I went to the hospital."
37,10,I saw a chair by her bed.
37,11,"""What's that for?"""
37,12,The nurse told me they were going to sit Marie.
37,13,"""What? No."""
37,14,She said it was the doctor's orders.
37,15,"Well, they tried but she passed out,"
37,16,so they put her back in bed.
37,17,Marie saw me from the window.
37,18,The nurse told me to wait.
37,19,"Next thing, she was rushing around."
37,20,"""Don't tell me it's my daughter you're rushing for?"""
37,21,It was.
37,22,We ran to her room where we found her in a cold sweat.
37,23,Drenched.
37,24,I went berserk.
37,25,"""Oh my god, you've killed my daughter!"""
37,26,"The doctor, a female doctor, came in."
37,27,She told me to be with Marie.
37,28,"""What can I possibly say to her?"""
37,29,I was out of my mind.
37,30,"As soon as I turned my back, she passed away."
37,31,"I kept screaming ""You've killed my daughter."""
37,32,The doctor couldn't tell me why she died.
37,33,Eventually they escorted me out of the hospital
37,34,and put me in a car.
37,35,"I screamed all the way home, pulling my hair out."
37,36,"By the time I got home, I didn't realise what a mess I looked."
37,37,All the neighbors came out to see who was screaming.
37,38,My husband came out and asked what was wrong.
37,39,"""It's Marie, she's dead."""
37,40,He had a heart attack.
37,41,My other daughter has been chronically ill for the twenty-eight years since.
37,42,Her leg goes stiff for weeks at a time.
37,43,I sent my son to tell his aunts the news.
37,44,"Seeing his red eyes, they asked him why he was crying."
37,45,He told them the news.
37,46,My other daughter got a phone call from the hospital.
37,47,They wanted her to pick me up.
37,48,"They were trying to sedate me but I told them ""Don't come near me!""."
37,49,I knew all the nurses because I'd already been in three times that year for operations.
38,1,A mother (Mary) lost her daughter (Marie).
38,2,"She had taken her for an operation,"
38,3,when they visited the hospital
38,4,staff tried to get her out of bed
38,5,"and she collapsed,"
38,6,because she clearly wasn’t ready to do that.
38,7,"Later, on the 18th of April she took her for another surgery"
38,8,"performed by a female doctor,"
38,9,and ten days later she died.
38,10,Mary went to collect her from the hospital
38,11,"carrying her coat and Marie's clothes on her arm,"
38,12,and when Mary arrived Marie had collapsed and died.
38,13,Mary accused the doctors of killing her daughter.
38,14,She didn’t want the doctors to operate
38,15,and find the cause of death.
38,16,She had to go home and tell everyone.
38,17,The news shocked her husband and son so much
38,18,they both collapsed of a heart attack.
38,19,Her other daughter has suffered with pain
38,20,for 28 years because of this.
38,21,"Even the shop lady nearby felt the pain of her death,"
38,22,"and recalled how nice, quiet, and kind Marie was."
38,23,"Mary sent Jamie, her other son, to tell their other family members."
39,1,Daughter went in for surgery for appendicitis at the local hospital
39,2,and it was on the 20th of the month.
39,3,The mother did not have a phone at the house
39,4,so had someone else that would take calls
39,5,when the daughter was ready to be picked up.
39,6,The mother prepared to pick up the daughter
39,7,by getting clothes and other items ready
39,8,for when he picked her up.
39,9,The mother then received a message
39,10,that her daughter was ready to be picked up
39,11,by the lady at the store with the phone.
39,12,When the mother got to the hospital
39,13,the nurses had her sit down for a bit
39,14,while she waited.
39,15,They then asked her if her daughter had a history of fainting
39,16,and then was taken to the room her daughter was in.
39,17,She seen her daughter in a poor state
39,18,with beads of sweat dripping
39,19,and suddenly came to the realization
39,20,that something is seriously wrong
39,21,"and started yelling ""you killed my daughter""."
39,22,The nurses and doctors did try to calm her down
39,23,but she would not.
39,24,The mother's other daughter arrived at the hospital soon
39,25,and found out what was happening
39,26,and collapsed to the floor
39,27,and died at the hospital also.
39,28,The mother was even more distraught
39,29,and threatened to burn the hospital down.
39,30,When the mother told the husband and brother
39,31,they both suffered heart attacks
39,32,and died.
39,33,It was a tragic story overall.
41,1,Mrs Costa lost a daughter named Marie
41,2,who had died from an appendicitis operation.
41,3,She had told everyone
41,4,and the entire neighbourhood
41,5,"her daughter would be coming back the same day,"
41,6,but instead the daughter passed away.
41,7,She was devastated
41,8,and the doctors asked to give her something
41,9,and she declined.
41,10,She went home
41,11,and told her husband
41,12,who end up having a heart attack
41,13,and her son Micheal
41,14,who also had a heart attack.
41,15,She sent her little son Jamie
41,16,to go tell his two aunts about the death.
41,17,The operation happened 20th of April
41,18,and a male doctor performed the operation
41,19,with the help of a female doctor.
41,20,Mrs Costa had her hair pulled
41,21,and she kept screaming
41,22,until everybody came out
41,23,and stood at their door.
42,1,"Marie had a appendectomy done,"
42,2,"The next day she was in a lot of pain,"
42,3,when nurses tried to move her from bed to chair.
42,4,But she had to be taken back to the bed.
42,5,"This might have caused a blood clot,"
42,6,the surgery was done in April.
42,7,"When her mother came to take her home,"
42,8,"after she was discharged,"
42,9,"Marie was very happy to see her,"
42,10,but sadly she passed away soon after.
42,11,"Her mother was very upset,"
42,12,"and cried a lot,"
42,13,"when she got home,"
42,14,her husband passed out from a heart attack.
42,15,"The community was also saddened,"
42,16,"by Marie's death,"
42,17,as everyone was waiting to welcome her back.
43,1,Mrs Costa's daughter Marie died
43,2,from a blood clot
43,3,after an operation
43,4,for appendicitis.
43,5,She was 18
43,6,and it happened 28 years ago.
43,7,Her father and brother had heart attacks.
44,1,A woman recalls the death of her daughter
44,2,which occurred 28 years ago
44,3,following an operation for appendicitis
44,4,at Methodist Hospital.
44,5,"After the surgery,"
44,6,her daughter was still under ether anesthesia.
44,7,"Despite this,"
44,8,a nurse followed the doctor’s orders
44,9,"to get her out of bed,"
44,10,though she was too weak.
44,11,The woman believes
44,12,"this action led to her daughter developing a blood clot,"
44,13,which she holds the hospital staff responsible for.
44,14,"The woman recounts her reaction to her daughter's sudden decline after surgery,"
44,15,accusing the doctors of killing her.
44,16,"She recalls screaming at the doctors,"
44,17,"particularly Dr. Montique,"
44,18,"the assistant to Dr. Schwartz,"
44,19,who performed the operation.
44,20,"Despite being told to talk to her daughter,"
44,21,"the woman was too distraught,"
44,22,as her daughter was dying.
44,23,"Overcome with hysteria,"
44,24,"she describes her daughter,"
44,25,"only 18 and ready to come home,"
44,26,passing away while she briefly turned away.
44,27,Her husband was waiting
44,28,"for their daughter at home,"
44,29,unaware of the tragedy unfolding at the hospital.
44,30,"The woman recalls confronting Dr. Montique,"
44,31,the assistant to Dr. Schwartz
44,32,"who performed the operation,"
44,33,accusing her of killing her daughter.
44,34,Dr. Montique admitted
44,35,they didn’t know what went wrong.
44,36,The nurse urged her
44,37,"to speak to her dying daughter,"
44,38,but the woman was too hysterical.
44,39,"Overwhelmed with grief,"
44,40,"she describes her daughter,"
44,41,"only 18 and beautiful,"
44,42,passing away the moment she turned her back.
45,1,"Marie, the daughter of Mrs Costa, died in hospital"
45,2,after suffering from a suspected blood clot in her leg.
45,3,Mrs Costa recalls telling her other children Rita & James
45,4,that their sister had died.
45,5,"Rita reacted in a bad way to the news,"
45,6,whilst James was then given the task
45,7,of passing on the news to his two aunties Millie & Jenny.
46,1,Ms Costa tells the story of how her daughter Marie died at the hospital
46,2,"ten days after an operation she had,"
46,3,from a blood clot.
46,4,The daughter was in the hospital
46,5,and the nurses tried to pick her up from the bed
46,6,"and have her sit on a chair,"
46,7,under the doctor's orders.
46,8,"When they got her out of the bed,"
46,9,she passed out
46,10,so they had to put her back to bed.
46,11,"After ten days,"
46,12,they called Ms Costa from the hospital
46,13,to come and pick her daughter up
46,14,and return her home.
46,15,A lady from a store called her
46,16,and told her that her daughter was discharged.
46,17,Mr Costa told her daughter Rita
46,18,to put a pot of coffee on
46,19,and buy some cake from the bakery.
46,20,She went then to the hospital
46,21,where she saw her daughter collapsed
46,22,with heavy beads of sweat on her forehead.
46,23,She started screaming
46,24,the doctor came
46,25,but they couldn't save her daughter.
46,26,She went home
46,27,and first she told her husband
46,28,and the rest of the family.
46,29,"Unfortunately, the husband had a heart attack"
46,30,due to the terrible news
46,31,and so did her son.
46,32,She also called her brother-in-law
46,33,who worked as an undertaker.
47,1,"Mrs. Costa's daughter Marie passed away,"
47,2,and she's recalling the story.
47,3,"She mentions how she was in hospital,"
47,4,only 18 years old at the time.
47,5,"She was there for 10 days,"
47,6,and there was an issue with getting Marie out of bed
47,7,"and the usage of ether,"
47,8,"and another daughter, Victoria, helped a nurse get Marie out of bed"
47,9,when they shouldn't have.
47,10,"Marie got a blood clot,"
47,11,and passed away because of that.
47,12,"The family was waiting to bring her home,"
47,13,"and Mrs. Costa went to the hospital,"
47,14,getting Marie's clothes all lined up.
47,15,"Meanwhile, the father shaved and got ready for her return."
47,16,"At the hospital, a nurse's aide came to Mrs. Costa"
47,17,"and explained that Marie had collapsed,"
47,18,and that they weren't sure exactly what happened.
47,19,"When Mrs. Costa got upset,"
47,20,they offered her a shot
47,21,"and she refused,"
47,22,saying they had killed her daughter
47,23,"and were trying to kill her,"
47,24,and she would trust the female Dr. Schwartz.
47,25,"The rest of the family had to be informed as well,"
47,26,"and they sent a small male to tell her sisters and mother,"
47,27,"and they all thought the boy was coming to tell them the good news,"
47,28,"that Marie had returned safely,"
47,29,when it was actually bad news.
47,30,This all happened around April 20th or so.
47,31,"Now, even when Mrs Costa goes to the store,"
47,32,the cashier there mentions how she used to see Marie sitting out on the step looking at the store.
48,1,"My daughter Marie was sick,"
48,2,"and I went to the hospital to see how she was,"
48,3,"she was still under,"
48,4,"back then, they used a lot of ether."
48,5,There was a chair there.
48,6,"They were just starting to get people out of the bed, you know."
48,7,"Victoria saw the chair and she said to the nurse, ""What's this chair doing here?"""
48,8,"And the nurse said, ""Well, we've got to get her out of bed."""
48,9,"She said, ""What are you talking about? She's still under ether and too sick."""
48,10,But the nurse insisted that was the doctor's orders.
48,11,So they went to get her out of bed and she passed out back in bed.
48,12,"Dr. Monique, she was a lady doctor,"
48,13,"so she came in and said ""You killed my daughter, what did you do to her?"""
48,14,"She said, ""Calm down, Mrs. Costa,"""
48,15,"She took me away from the bed,"
48,16,"and the nurse said to her, ""Talk to her,"""
48,17,"My daughter Marie is dying, what am I supposed to tell her?"
48,18,"And Costa was screaming, with her hair all pulled out."
48,19,"I was hysterical, you know."
48,20,"I walked into the room,"
48,21,my daughter collapsed on the hard floor when I told her about Marie
48,22,"and I told the doctors not to touch her,"
48,23,"I kept screaming and hitting my head on the wall,"
48,24,"I was hysterical,"
48,25,"they took me home,"
48,26,I was screaming and neighbors were coming out
48,27,"and my husband was sitting on the stairs,"
48,28,"he asked, ""What is wrong with you?"""
48,29,"I told him Marie died,"
48,30,My sisters were with us till 4 a.m. waiting for Marie to come home.
48,31,They had an orange for her.
49,1,"Mrs. Costa's daughter Marie died,"
49,2,"in Methodist Hospital,"
49,3,"of a blood clot,"
49,4,at age 18.
49,5,"Her daughter and nurse tried to move her,"
49,6,whilst she was on Ether.
49,7,"She had an operation for Appendicitis,"
49,8,on a Saturday afternoon.
49,9,They used a lot of Ether back then.
49,10,"She passed out,"
49,11,when trying to be moved.
49,12,"Her sister said that she was too sick to move,"
49,13,despite her sister saying that.
49,14,"The parents worked at a store,"
49,15,"and the mother got a call,"
49,16,to pick Marie up.
49,17,"There was some confusion at the hospital,"
49,18,about whether Mrs. Costa was there.
49,19,"Rita, her daughter, finished the dinner,"
49,20,and her dad would be home soon.
49,21,"Mrs. Costa was chilly in the hospital,"
49,22,"in just a dress,"
49,23,so they gave her a blanket.
49,24,The nurse noticed she was in a cold sweat.
49,25,"Her mother bought her a girdle,"
49,26,to put on.
49,27,"Another lady had an operation,"
49,28,for her gallbladder.
49,29,"Mrs. Costa went into the room,"
49,30,"and Marie was sweating,"
49,31,"on the bed,"
49,32,with slippers and a housecoat.
49,33,"Mrs. Costa told the lady doctor that she killed her daughter,"
49,34,and was screaming.
49,35,"There was some confusion,"
49,36,"about whether Mrs Costa was still at the store,"
49,37,and the hospital kept ringing the store.
49,38,"Rita then came to the hospital,"
49,39,"and fell to her knees,"
49,40,when she was told Marie was dead.
49,41,"Mrs. Costa was well known at the hospital,"
49,42,for having 3 operations.
49,43,Her brother in law (now dead) was an undertaker.
50,1,No idea
50,2,a lot of people died
50,3,something about the doctor
50,4,There was
50,5,"a funeral director,"
50,6,a Marie.
51,1,"Mrs Costa's daughter, Marie, was in the hospital getting treated for an illness."
51,2,"During the end of her stay,"
51,3,"the day she was supposed to be discharged,"
51,4,the nurses had Marie try to walk around her hospital room.
51,5,"Mrs Costa believes that this caused a blood clot in her leg,"
51,6,which led to her death at the time of discharge.
51,7,"On the day of her discharge,"
51,8,the family was looking forward to her coming home.
51,9,They received a call through a local store that she was ready to be discharged
51,10,do they not have a phone?
51,11,They got everything ready for Marie.
51,12,They had coffee and breakfast prepared
51,13,and Mrs Costa went by herself to pick Mary up.
51,14,Her husband and other daughter stayed at their house to continue preparing.
51,15,"At this time, other family members were notified that Marie was being released on that day."
51,16,Costa states that she had clothes and other things laid out
51,17,and brought jackets and clothes to the hospital with her.
51,18,"At the hospital, Costa was told to sit and wait."
51,19,She sat with another patient who'd had gallbladder surgery
51,20,and prayed for her recovery because she had way too many children.
51,21,"While waiting, she saw some medical staff running to a patient."
51,22,"Costa quickly learned that they were running to treat a medical emergency for Marie,"
51,23,who had developed a clot in her leg.
51,24,She was taken to Marie's room.
51,25,"Marie was visibly unwell,"
51,26,sweating heavily and with an unnaturally stiff leg
51,27,Costa started to panic and become belligerent
51,28,while the doctors rushed around trying to mitigate the situation.
51,29,"During that mess, Marie succumbed to the blood clot."
51,30,Costa became understandably enraged and started shouting about how the hospital had killed her daughter
51,31,and complained that they wanted to kill her as well when offerings some sort of calming injection.
51,32,"After some more time the husband and other daughter arrived at the hospital,"
51,33,as they'd become concerned about the lack of updates.
51,34,They learned at that point that Marie had died.
51,35,"However, Costa's story has an inconsistency from how I recall it here"
51,36,because she then goes on to say that her husband was waiting on the porch
51,37,and asked what was wrong when she arrived
51,38,and only sat in the car screaming.
51,39,They sent one of their other children or grandchildren to notify other relatives.
51,40,"He seems to have been a child and was crying by the time he arrived,"
51,41,leading them to ask what was wrong before he broke the news.
51,42,Costa then rambles a bit more about unnecessary details
51,43,but I don't remember them because they weren't key to the story.
52,1,Mrs Mary Costas tells the story
52,2,of when she was younger
52,3,"and her daughter, Marie died."
52,4,She died post surgery
52,5,from a blood clot.
52,6,She was supposed to be discharged that day
52,7,"when Mrs Costas went to pick up her daughter,"
52,8,she got sick
52,9,"and then fainted,"
52,10,but she actually died.
52,11,"Mrs Costas had a bad breakdown,"
52,12,"was hysterical,"
52,13,hurting herself
52,14,and threatening others.
52,15,"When she got home,"
52,16,"Mike, the father, had a heart attack."
52,17,"Then Michael, the son, had a heart attack."
52,18,Rita was Marie's sister.
52,19,"There was also a younger son,"
52,20,who told the two aunts that Marie had died.
52,21,Mrs Costas had 3 surgeries within a year
52,22,so she knew all the nurses.
53,1,The story was told by a woman
53,2,who's daughter died.
53,3,"The daughter, named Marie, died of a blood clot"
53,4,after surgery.
53,5,It was on the thirtieth or maybe the 28th of the month
53,6,that she died.
53,7,The hospital had called the store down the road from them
53,8,to speak with Rita
53,9,to let the mother know that Marie was ready to be picked up.
53,10,"Marie died while saying goodbye to another woman in the hospital,"
53,11,she said she had a pain in her leg
53,12,and couldn't see
53,13,right before she dropped to the ground.
53,14,The woman telling the story went to the hospital
53,15,and said they needed to find out what happened.
53,16,The woman doctor who was the assistant of the doctor who performed the surgery
53,17,told her she didn't know what happened.
53,18,The mother said she was going to burn the hospital down
53,19,despite who was inside
53,20,if they didn't find out what happened to her daughter.
53,21,She also said they better not touch her.
53,22,When the woman who told the story (the mother) went home
53,23,she told the father
53,24,and he had a heart attack on the spot
53,25,while sitting on the front step
53,26,waiting to see Marie.
53,27,The brother also had a heart attack
53,28,upon hearing the news.
53,29,The older sister watched Marie die in the hospital.
53,30,The mother had a bad heart herself
53,31,and had known the nurses
53,32,because she had three surgeries all within one year.
53,33,The doctors wanted to give the mother a shot
53,34,because of how upset she was
53,35,but she turned it away.
54,1,Mrs Costa's daughter Marie was in the hospital for an Appendicitis
54,2,"and when Mrs. Costa went to pick her up,"
54,3,"as Marie was saying goodbye to the nurses,"
54,4,she passed out
54,5,after claiming her leg hurt
54,6,and she lost her vision.
54,7,Mrs Costa was on her way to the hospital
54,8,with Marie's clothes she would wear home.
54,9,"When Mrs. Costa arrived at the hospital,"
54,10,"as she was praying for another patient,"
54,11,she was informed that something was wrong with Marie.
54,12,Mrs Costa had a nervous breakdown
54,13,"and screamed that they killed her daughter,"
54,14,as Marie laid in her bed covered in sweat.
54,15,She pulled her hair out
54,16,and screamed.
54,17,She went home
54,18,where many family members were waiting for Marie to return home
54,19,"but when she told her husband and son about Marie dying,"
54,20,they both had heart attacks.
54,21,Everyone was shocked and saddened.
54,22,The neighbor recalled Marie standing at the steps of their store
54,23,and how quiet she was.
55,1,I remember it like it was yesterday.
55,2,"I had just gotten a message telling me to come over, so I went."
55,3,"When I arrived, they asked me to sit down."
55,4,I was already praying for another woman I knew—someone from my sister's neighborhood.
55,5,She had just had an operation.
55,6,She had ten kids.
55,7,I was pleading with God not to take her away from them.
55,8,"But as I sat there, things started to take a turn."
55,9,I was getting chills.
55,10,A nurse's aide even brought me a blanket.
55,11,"I was trying to shake off the feeling when the nurse said to me, “Has your daughter ever had a fainting spell?”"
55,12,"And right then, my heart sank."
55,13,I rushed to the room.
55,14,I saw my daughter Marie lying there.
55,15,Her slippers still on.
55,16,Sweat just pouring off of her.
55,17,"I couldn't believe it—I just kept yelling, ""What did you do to her? You killed my daughter!"""
55,18,The doctors were trying to explain.
55,19,All I could hear was them telling me they didn’t know what had happened.
55,20,My beautiful Marie... she was only 18.
55,21,I was hysterical.
55,22,"I was pulling at my hair, screaming."
55,23,She was supposed to come home that day.
55,24,We had everything ready.
55,25,My husband was waiting at home for her.
55,26,Sitting on the step.
55,27,Not knowing what was about to happen.
55,28,"When the hospital called the store, they asked, ""When is the mother coming to pick up Marie?"""
55,29,"But my family, who was with me, knew something wasn't right."
55,30,They all rushed back to the hospital.
55,31,Thinking maybe I had gotten sick myself because of my heart condition.
55,32,But when they arrived.
55,33,They saw me in the state I was in.
55,34,They knew.
55,35,"I told them, ""We lost Marie. Marie died."""
55,36,It was chaos.
55,37,My daughter Rita collapsed on the floor.
55,38,As if struck by lightning.
55,39,She heard the news.
55,40,She’s been suffering ever since.
55,41,Dealing with pain that comes and goes.
55,42,Doctors later said it was a blood clot that caused Marie’s death.
55,43,The girl who was with her said the last thing Marie complained about was pain in her leg.
55,44,Not being able to see.
55,45,And then she collapsed.
55,46,"When I got home, the entire neighborhood could hear my screams."
55,47,My husband was sitting there.
55,48,"Asking, ""What happened?"""
55,49,"I told him, ""We lost Marie."""
55,50,He had a heart attack right there on the spot.
55,51,"That same night, my son Michael collapsed too."
55,52,It was just devastation all around.
55,53,Everyone had been waiting for Marie to come home that day.
55,54,My youngest sister had even brought a giant orange for her as a little gift.
55,55,"But instead of celebrating her coming home, we were left to deal with this heartbreaking loss."
55,56,It shocked everyone.
55,57,My family.
55,58,The neighbors.
55,59,Everyone who knew Marie.
55,60,"She was such a quiet, sweet girl."
55,61,And now... she was gone.
56,1,A girl called Maria
56,2,died 28 years ago
56,3,possibly because of hospital neglect
56,4,which led to a blood clot
57,1,The daughter died 28 years ago on the 13th of the month.
57,2,Her sister Victoria went to the hospital
57,3,and the daughter was discharged for 10 days.
57,4,She died of a blood clot.
57,5,She had two sisters.
57,6,At the funeral was Aunt Millie
57,7,"and Aunt Jenny,"
57,8,"Brother-in-law,"
57,9,"Mary,"
57,10,"James,"
57,11,"Michael,"
57,12,"Annie,"
57,13,(who died of a) heart attack.
58,1,"28 years ago, Mrs. Costa's daughter Marie died"
58,2,at the age of 18.
58,3,She had been hospitalized for appendicitis
58,4,and received surgery
58,5,while under ether for anesthesia.
58,6,She suffered some initial post-surgical complications
58,7,"and was hospitalized for 10 days,"
58,8,during which time the nursing staff made her sit
58,9,and walk around
58,10,in ways her mother now believes may have contributed to her death.
58,11,Marie suffered a blood clot
58,12,"as she was being released from the hospital,"
58,13,fainting
58,14,and sweating profusely
58,15,while her mother waited in the other room
58,16,to help her get dressed
58,17,for the trip home.
58,18,"Mrs. Costa had happily prepared for Marie's release,"
58,19,instructing other family members
58,20,to take care of certain tasks
58,21,ahead of Marie's arrival.
58,22,"While Marie was experiencing the emergency that led to her death,"
58,23,other family members were eagerly awaiting her.
58,24,The hospital office staff was not aware
58,25,Marie had just passed away
58,26,"and, during the crisis,"
58,27,was calling the family
58,28,wondering why Marie hadn't completed her release to home yet.
58,29,"When Mrs. Costa became aware of Marie's emergency,"
58,30,she became agitated
58,31,"and terribly upset,"
58,32,accusing doctors and nurses of killing her daughter.
58,33,Marie is still remembered by those who loved her;
58,34,her mother honors Marie's memory each day
58,35,"as she drinks her first cup of coffee,"
58,36,and family friends reminisce about seeing Marie
58,37,in their memories
58,38,as though she were there in real life.
59,1,Mr's Costa's daughter Marie was in the hospital.
59,2,She has appendicitis.
59,3,"When Mrs. Costa went to the hospital,"
59,4,the nurse had a chair.
59,5,"When asked why,"
59,6,the nurse said Dr.'s orders.
59,7,Then she slipped
59,8,and Mrs. Costa believes the fall caused her to have a blood clot.
59,9,"After 10 days,"

59,11,She asked her husband to make a pot of coffee
59,12,and get a cake for Marie.
59,13,Marie loved coffee
59,14,and was the first to have coffee in the morning.
59,15,"When the mom went to Wood Street,"
59,16,her daughter could see she was about to arrive.
59,17,"The nurse told her to sit down,"
59,18,that Marie was dying.
59,19,Mrs. Costa started screaming
59,20,and pulled her hair out
59,21,and yelled that they had killed her daughter.
59,22,Mrs. Costa was screaming and crying.
59,23,She was only 18.
59,24,The female doctor came in the room
59,25,and wanted to give her a shot to calm her down.
59,26,Mrs. Costa went home
59,27,and was screaming so loudly that the neighbors came out.
59,28,She told her husband about the death.
59,29,Her sisters were told by James
59,30,that Marie was dead.
59,31,He was crying with bloodshot eyes.
59,32,Then they contacted her brother-in-law
59,33,who is an undertaker.
59,34,"When Mrs. Costa went to the store,"
59,35,the clerk said she remembered Marie on the set
59,36,and that she was a sweet quiet girl.

61,1,My daughter died.
61,2,She'd be twenty-eight years this month.
61,3,The thirtieth of this month yeah.
61,4,She died at Methodist Hospital.
61,5,She had an operation for appendicitis.
61,6,"It was Saturday afternoon when they operated, very late."
61,7,"Sunday morning, my oldest daughter, Victoria, went to the hospital to see how she was."
61,8,She was still under ether.
61,9,"Back then, they used a lot of ether."
61,10,There was a chair there.
61,11,They were just starting to get people out.
61,12,"So Victoria saw the chair and she said to the nurse, ""What's this chair doing here?"""
61,13,"The nurse said ""Well, we've got to get her out of bed""."
61,14,"She said, ""What are you talking about? She's still under ether."""
61,15,"""She's too sick."""
61,16,"But the nurse said, well, that's the doctor's orders."
61,17,"So they went to get her out of bed and she passed out,"
61,18,and they had to put her back in bed.
61,19,"See, here she never -"
61,20,"I don't know if they know or what,"
61,21,"but I blame them for the blood clot she got, taking her out of bed."
61,22,"So when she was walking around to come home after ten days,"
61,23,I was waiting for the call from the hospital.
61,24,I didn't have a phone then.
61,25,"The lady from the store who had a phone called me, ""Mrs. Costa,"" at a quarter to five at night."
61,26,"""Mrs. Costa, they just called you from the hospital."
61,27,Go pick Marie up.

61,33,"Daddy will be home soon""."
61,34,He was working down in the yard.
61,35,"I said, ""And put a big pot of coffee on"""
61,36,because she had been wishing for coffee.
61,37,"And you know every morning,"
61,38,"that first cup of coffee,"
61,39,I offered it to her.
61,40,When I get up in the morning the first cup is hers.
61,41,It came -
61,42,just poured from her -
61,43,"I said, “What did you do, kill my daughter?"
61,44,You killed her!
61,45,You killed her!”
61,46,That's what I kept yelling.
61,47,"And the doctor rushed in,"
61,48,"see, they were trying to get"
62,1,"A woman, Mrs. Costa, takes her daughter Marie to the hospital for surgery on her appendix."
62,2,It should be routine without any issues.
62,3,Mrs. Costa goes home
62,4,and waits for the hospital to call her to pick up her daughter.
62,5,"When they call and she goes into the hospital,"
62,6,she finds out her daughter died.
62,7,The surgeon was a woman named Dr. Schwartz.
62,8,The Dr. tells her she heard Marie tell a girl that her leg hurt.
62,9,The Dr. says there was a blood clot
62,10,and that's what caused Marie's death.
62,11,"When Mrs. Costa goes into the hospital room,"
62,12,her daughter Marie is dressed in her slippers and robe.
62,13,Mrs. Costa gets very upset
62,14,and starts yelling.
62,15,The nurses try to take her to an office
62,16,and give her a shot of something to calm her down
62,17,but Mrs. Costa won't let them.
62,18,She yells at them to Stay Away from Her!
62,19,"When Mrs. Costa goes home,"
62,20,her husband is waiting on the stairs.
62,21,"When she tells him Marie has died,"
62,22,he has a heart attack.
62,23,Another man or boy comes out
62,24,"and when she tells him what happened,"
62,25,he has a heart attack as well.
62,26,"Mrs. Costa remembers that her sisters are waiting to hear about Marie as well,"
62,27,so she sends her son James to tell them what happened.
62,28,One of the sisters' husbands is also an undertaker.
62,29,"When James arrives at their house,"
62,30,they're excited to see him
62,31,but they quickly notice his eyes are red from crying.
62,32,"When they ask him what happened,"
62,33,he tells them Marie died.

63,2,and finds out her daughter has died.
63,3,She lived with multiple daughters.
63,4,Marie was only 18.
63,5,She died from a blood clot.
63,6,The mom went crazy in the hospital
63,7,"after finding out the news,"
63,8,and she did not like the doctors.
63,9,She threatened to burn down the hospital

63,13,She told the news to everyone else;
63,14,they were all sad.

64,7,"She replied ""So you have a place to sit."""
64,8,A couple weeks later.
64,9,I got a call from the doctor.
64,10,Saying that Marie was ready to be discharged.
64,11,I was cooking at the time.
64,12,I told someone to finish cooking.
64,13,While I go pick up Marie.
64,14,"""Go to the bakery and get a cake for Marie."""

64,17,I placed my coat & Marie's clothes over 1 arm.
64,18,& headed out to go pick her up.
64,19,Once I arrived at the hospital.
64,20,I was told to wait in the lobby.

64,22,At the time.
64,23,There was a mother of 10 children.
64,24,That was my neighbor.
64,25,Getting surgery for a gallbladder stone.
64,26,I prayed to God that she made it through.
64,27,"""Dear lord, please do not take this mother away from her children."""
64,28,The nurse came back then.
64,29,Picked up the phone.
64,30,She came to me.
64,31,"And asked ""Has your daughter ever had tendencies to faint?"""
64,32,She told me.
64,33,That as Marie was getting ready to leave.

64,40,I yelled at the nurse.
64,41,A doctor rushed in.
64,42,"""We don't know what happened."""
64,43,I was banging my head against the wall.
64,44,Hair pulled out.
64,45,& hysterical.
64,46,My other daughter & husband were wondering what was taking so long to bring home Marie.
64,47,So my other daughter went to the hospital as well.
64,48,She heard me screaming.
64,49,And asked what was going on.
64,50,"""They killed Marie!"""
64,51,I told her.
64,52,She dropped to her knees.
64,53,Staring blankly at the floor.
64,54,Marie's leg was hard as a pole.
64,55,From the blood clot she had.
64,56,Still hysterical.

64,63,My husband was sitting in front of the house.

64,69,I called everyone.
64,70,To tell them what had happened.
64,71,I told my son James.

64,73,About what happened.
64,74,"""Why are you crying little James?"""
64,75,Asked my sister.
64,76,"""Auntie, Granny... Marie died."""

65,2,after an operation for appendices
65,3,"which led to a blood clot,"

66,1,"Marie, an 18 year old girl, went into the hospital for a surgery"
66,2,"and died from a blood clot,"
66,3,28 years ago.
66,4,"Her mother, Mrs. Costa, recalls the event."
66,5,She started her day with a cup of coffee
66,6,and headed to the hospital to pick her daughter up from this routine surgery.
66,7,"There was another lady she knew there,"
66,8,who was a mother.
66,9,She prayed that the mother would be ok
66,10,and when doing so saw nurses running for blankets etc.
66,11,She then learned that her daughter had fainted
66,12,and was pooling with sweat.
66,13,She then learned that her daughter had died
66,14,which put her into a state of shock.
66,15,She was hysterical
66,16,and the dr wanted to give her a shot there afterward to calm her down
66,17,which she refused.
66,18,Her daughter got a call from the hospital
66,19,"that they were waiting for the mother to pick her up,"
66,20,confused she headed over to the hospital
66,21,"to find her mother, Mrs. Costa, in a hysterical state."
66,22,She then learned her sister had died.
66,23,She fell to the ground
66,24,causing an injury to her leg that she still deals with today.
66,25,She took her mother home
66,26,and her mother informed her husband
66,27,"as well as one of her brothers, the older one."
66,28,Both men had heart attacks when they learned the news.
66,29,"The youngest of the two brothers was sent to inform his aunts, Jenny and Millie, of what happened."
66,30,They recalled Marie being a nice and quiet girl.
67,1,There is a woman (Mrs. Costa) telling a story
67,2,about how her daughter Marie has passed away
67,3,at a hospital
67,4,due to a blood clot.
67,5,She was waiting for the hospital to call her
67,6,to let her know that her daughter Marie would be dispatched
67,7,and when she got the call
67,8,she got clothes ready for her
67,9,and made her way to the hospital.
67,10,When Mrs. Costa got to the hospital
67,11,the nurse suddenly told her
67,12,that her daughter was in bad shape
67,13,and had a fainting spell
67,14,and that she was with slippers and a robe
67,15,and she collapsed
67,16,and then she passed away.
67,17,The mother was furious
67,18,and yelling at the hospital staff
67,19,that they killed her
67,20,and was screaming for them not to touch her
67,21,because they wanted to check the cause of death.
67,22,Mrs. Costa was hysterical
67,23,and yelling
67,24,and telling the doctors that operated on Marie
67,25,that she will kill them
67,26,if they got any closer to her
67,27,and when Mrs. Costa got home
67,28,she told her husband Michael
67,29,that Marie was dead
67,30,and the husband had a heart attack
67,31,and in the end
67,32,there was something about an orange from the aunt
67,33,and that is all I remember.
68,1,"Mother is telling about incident of her daughter`s death,"
68,2,"her daughter had an operation in hospital,"
68,3,"It was late Saturday afternoon when they operated her,"
68,4,"and Sunday morning when her elder daughter Victoria went to hospital,"

68,6,"but Victoria saw a chair besides her,"
68,7,then Victoria asked nurse why chair is here?
68,8,"Nurse replied we got to get her out of the bed,"
68,9,Victoria shocked and said how come a sick person who can’t even stand can sit on a chair?
68,10,"Nurse said I can’t do anything that's doctor's orders,"
68,11,"so they took her out of bed,"
68,12,"and she passed out,"
68,13,they had to put her back into bed.
68,14,"Mother did not know the exact reason of her daughter's death,"
68,15,"but she blamed doctor for the blood clot she got,"

68,28,how did it happened?
68,29,no one had a clue.
69,1,"Marie, who was 18, was in the hospital"
69,2,for an appendicitis operation
69,3,on April 20th.
69,4,The mother Mary and the daughter Victoria went to the hospital
69,5,to see how she was doing
69,6,on April 30th
69,7,but she wasn't ready to be discharged yet.
69,8,"The operation was done by Dr. Shaw,"

69,11,The hospital had called
69,12,to let Mary know
69,13,"that Marie was ready to be discharged,"
69,14,"but since she didn't have a phone,"
69,15,the hospital had called the store.
69,16,The store lady had let Mary know
69,17,that her daughter Marie was ready for discharge
69,18,"but when Marie got there,"

69,25,The mother had decided to tell the youngest boy
69,26,to tell his aunt and uncle about the incident
69,27,instead of calling
69,28,"and as the boy had arrived,"

70,11,"I blame them for the blood she got,"
70,12,taking her out of bed too quickly.
70,13,"I didn't have a phone at the time,"
70,14,"someone told me that she was being discharged,"
70,15,and I had to go and get her.

71,20,thinking she was in distress
71,21,because of the nurses running around
71,22,not knowing
71,23,that it was for her daughter.
71,24,"She got to know it was her daughter,"

74,3,She was very young
74,4,and had been unwell for a wee while.
74,5,She had her operation

74,8,through the shop
74,9,to go and pick her up.

74,26,that she had been walking
74,27,with another patient
74,28,and had complained of a pain in her leg
74,29,and was unable to see.
74,30,She then had fallen to the ground
74,31,and had died.
74,32,"Mrs Costa was in shock,"
74,33,she was expecting to take Marie home
74,34,and did not understand how this could have happened.
74,35,She was screaming at the doctors and nurses
74,36,not to touch Marie
74,37,and she threatened to burn down the hospital
74,38,without caring who was there.
74,39,She was taken home
74,40,and saw her husband sitting on the house steps
74,41,waiting on them.
74,42,He did not understand
74,43,how Marie was not coming home
74,44,and said the his wife had gone there to take her home.
74,45,The youngest son was told
74,46,to go and tell others

75,1,"It had been 28 years since the narrator’s daughter, Marie, passed away."
75,2,Marie had been operated on for appendicitis at Methodist Hospital.
75,3,"After the surgery, they used a lot of ether."

75,11,"However, when the narrator arrived, a nurse told her to sit down and wait."
75,12,The narrator prayed for another patient.
75,13,Then a nurse informed her that Marie was sweating heavily and appeared to be in distress.
75,14,The narrator rushed into the room.
75,15,She saw Marie sweating profusely.
75,16,"In a panic, she accused the doctors and nurses of killing her daughter."
75,17,"Soon after, Marie passed away while preparing to come home."
75,18,The hospital staff had tried to contact the family.
75,19,"When the narrator's other daughter, Rita, and son-in-law arrived, they found the narrator in a state of hysterics."
75,20,The news was devastating.
75,21,It led to more health complications for family members.
76,1,Mrs Costa's daughter Marie died at hospital from a blood clot.
76,2,It was completely unexpected.
76,3,Mrs Costa had a mental breakdown.
76,4,She was taken home by her daughter Rita and her son-in-law.
76,5,Later that day she told her husband and son what had happened
76,6,and both suffered from a heart attack.
76,7,She sent her youngest son James to her sister's
76,8,to tell them the unfortunate news.
77,1,"The story is about the death of Marie,"
77,2,28 years ago from the perspective of her mother.
77,3,"Marie is in hospital recovering from an operation,"
77,4,but is not conscious;
77,5,"the nurses want to move her from her bed,"
77,6,"and the mother thinks that's what caused the blood clot,"
77,7,and killed her.
77,8,The mother goes to pick Marie up from hospital
77,9,as they call the local store to tell her that Marie is being discharged.
77,10,The mother tells her to put on some coffee ready for when they get back.
77,11,"When the mother gets to the hospital,"
77,12,the nurses ask her if Marie has ever had fainting spells.
77,13,They then rush to get the doctors
77,14,"as Marie has taken a bad turn,"
77,15,and died.
77,16,Marie's mother is hysterical and crying
77,17,blaming the hospital for her death.
77,18,"When she gets home and tells her husband,"
77,19,he has a heart attack.
77,20,She sends her young son in law to go and tell her sisters the news.
77,21,Everyone is so upset
77,22,and says how nice of a girl Marie was
77,23,and how sorry they are to hear that she has passed.
78,1,Mrs. Costa had a daughter
78,2,whom was sick
78,3,by the name of Marie
78,4,who was in the hospital.
78,5,She did not have a phone
78,6,so the hospital phoned the shop
78,7,where she was at
78,8,and the lady gave her the phone
78,9,and the nurse told her
78,10,that her daughter Marie was discharged
78,11,that she could come pick her up.
78,12,She took some clothes for Marie to wear
78,13,and they prepared her to come.
78,14,As she arrived at the hospital
78,15,she saw Marie at the hospital room window
78,16,and when she was inside the hospital
78,17,she saw the nurse was on the phone
78,18,and someone came to tell her what was going on
78,19,and as she was running
78,20,Mrs. Costa asked the nurse
78,21,if it was about her daughter
78,22,the reason why she was rushing
78,23,and leaving the phone
78,24,and later on she was told
78,25,that Marie died
78,26,and did not know what was the cause
78,27,and she started to yell
78,28,and screaming why did the doctors and nurses killed her daughter
78,29,and she continued to scream
78,30,"""don’t touch me, don’t touch me or I will kill you"""
78,31,because Mrs. Costa had three operations within the year
78,32,at the same hospital
78,33,and knew all the nurses.
78,34,When she got home
78,35,everyone was waiting to see Marie
78,36,and she had to tell them
78,37,the devastating news
78,38,that Marie had passed away.
79,1,Marie went into the hospital
79,2,to have an operation.
79,3,She ended up dying
79,4,after the operation
79,5,at the hospital.
79,6,"Her mom, Mrs. Costa went to the hospital"
79,7,to pick her up
79,8,and discovered something had happened.
79,9,She became angry
79,10,and shouted at the nurse in the room
79,11,that they had killed her daughter.
79,12,The doctor who performed the operation sent his assistant doctor
79,13,to understand why Mrs. Costa was yelling.
79,14,She discussed that she knew the staff
79,15,because she had three operations done herself.
79,16,She refused to allow the staff
79,17,to touch her daughter or her
79,18,because she felt they had killed her daughter.
79,19,When she arrived back home
79,20,her husband was waiting on the steps.
79,21,"She told him that their daughter had died,"
79,22,and he fainted.
79,23,She told others the same news
79,24,and they fainted.
79,25,They held a funeral.
80,1,An eighteen year old girl Marie died in hospital
80,2,due to blood clot in her leg.
80,3,The hospital was responsible for that.
80,4,The mother of the girl was narrating the story
80,5,and was describing how her whole [family] was getting ready to welcome their daughter
80,6,and she went back to the hospital as Marie was going to be discharged that day.

80,8,and collapsed.
80,9,The mother was there
80,10,and she was talking to other patients she knew before
80,11,and one nurse called her to inform [her] that her daughter [was] in bad condition.

80,25,As she was crying
80,26,the nurse told her that they [were] going to find the reason of Marie's condition
80,27,but she screamed [to] not to touch her daughter.
80,28,All this happened twenty-eight years ago.
80,29,Her sisters were waiting to welcome Marie home
80,30,"and they said to Mrs. Costa as soon as Marie [was] discharged,"
80,31,let them know.
80,32,"She called her sisters and her brother-in-law,"
80,33,"her sister's husband,"
80,34,and described the whole situation.
80,35,She was hysterical
80,36,and couldn't say much.
80,37,It was all heartbroken.

82,12,She saw me from the window.
82,13,I went on to pray for another woman
82,14,who had her gall bladder removed.
82,15,The nurse then called me to my daughter's room
82,16,and said has your daughter ever fainted?
82,17,"I then accused the nurses of killing my daughter,"
82,18,"'you killed her,"" I said."
82,19,I went hysterical
82,20,[that] one doctor wanted to give me a shot.

91,3,Victoria went to visit her to see how she was.
91,4,They were getting people out of bed.
91,5,Victoria asked the nurse about the chairs.
91,6,Victoria said she was too ill to get out of bed.
91,7,She was blamed for the blood cot for getting her out of bed.
91,8,She came home after ten days and I was waiting for a call from the hospital.
91,9,She was operated on in April on the twentieth.
91,10,It was chilly and I had a coat on my arm and a bag.
91,11,She saw from the window on Wolf Street.
91,12,She said my mother was coming and was just saying bye to everyone.
91,13,When I got to the hospital I was told to sit down and I prayed for another patient who had ten children and lived near my mother.
91,14,Dr. Schwartz did the operation but his assistant was Dr. Monique who was a lady doctor.
91,15,I had all her clothes ready for her to go home.
91,16,My husband was waiting for me.
91,17,He came home and washed and shaved and then waited for me.
91,18,They called the store to find out when mother was coming home.
91,19,A doctor wanted to give me a shot but I said no I'll kick you.
91,20,"You killed my daughter and now want to kill me, don't dare come near me."
92,1,"On the 28th or 30th of April,"
92,2,Marie was hospitalized for an appendices surgical operation.
92,3,She was too weak and
92,4,was put to bed for quite some time.
92,5,"After a while,"
92,6,Victoria noticed something was wrong and
92,7,Marie was removed from her bed.
92,8,She enquired from the nurse why this happened and
92,9,she was told that the doctor ordered it.
92,10,Victoria in rage told the nurse Marie was too weak and sick and
92,11,She returned Marie back to her bed
92,12,after Marie passed out.
92,13,Mrs. Costa got a call in the middle of the night
92,14,from the woman at the store
92,15,because she didn't have a phone.
92,16,She told Mrs. Costa to go get Marie at the hospital.
92,17,Mrs. Costa set out to the hospital
92,18,and instructed Rita to finish up the cooking
92,19,because their daddy will be home soon.
92,20,Mrs. Costa bought some dress-like coats for Marie
92,21,and took it with her to the hospital.
92,22,"On getting to the hospital,"
92,23,the nurse sat her down
92,24,and questioned her if Marie has had a fainting spell
92,25,and Mrs. Costa felt uneasy and answered yes
92,26,and she was invited to her daughter's room
92,27,and saw her daughter lying on the bed lifeless.
92,28,Mrs. Costa was filled with emotions
92,29,and crying and wailing
92,30,and then the doctor who carried out the operation came in
92,31,"and immediately,"
92,32,Mrs. Costa asked her what she did to her daughter
92,33,but the doctor replied by saying she doesn't know what happened.
92,34,"Afterwards, the nurse advised her to talk to her daughter"
92,35,but Mrs. Costa was confused
92,36,and she was in agony.
92,37,Mrs. Costa husband was now home
92,38,"and expecting his wife to return with his daughter,"
92,39,he was calling the store to enquire what must have happened
92,40,thinking that Marie was already discharged.
92,41,So Rita went to the hospital herself
92,42,and she was surprised at what she saw.
92,43,Her mother broke the news
92,44,"that her sister, Marie has died"
92,45,"and on hearing it,"
92,46,Rita could not control herself.
92,47,She fell on the hard floor
92,48,in shock and in grief
92,49,and she had a problem that developed due to this fall.
92,50,"When Marie's body wanted to be moved,"
92,51,Mrs. Costa didn't allow it
92,52,because she was in grief.
92,53,When the news got to her husband
92,54,"and her son,"
92,55,they both got a heart attack
92,56,and Mrs. Costa sent his junior son
92,57,to go tell his uncle
92,58,of what has happened.
93,1,Marie was in the hospital on ether
93,2,[they] tried to sit her in a chair
93,3,but she collapsed
93,4,and had a blood clot
93,5,She was 18 years old
93,6,Marine was due to come home
93,7,The hospital phoned the shop
93,8,to say she could come home
93,9,as the family didn't have a phone
93,10,Ms. Costa at the shop let the family know
93,11,Marine was ready to come home
93,12,The mother went to the hospital
93,13,to collect Marine
93,14,She waved at the window
93,15,saying bye to everyone
93,16,Once Marine[mother]'s mother reached the hospital
93,17,Marine had collapsed
93,18,and the nurse sat the mother down
93,19,and didn't tell her straight away
93,20,Marine had cold sweat
93,21,and had developed another blood clot
93,22,that caused her to die
93,23,The rest of the family arrived
93,24,[Dad and stepbrother]
93,25,They both suffered a heart attack
93,26,Marine was a quiet girl
93,27,who used to stand on the step across from the shop
93,28,said Ms. Costa
94,1,A teenager named Marie died in hospital
94,2,"and the story was told from the point of view of her mother, Mrs. Costa."
94,3,Victoria was the eldest daughter
94,4,and Mike was her husband.
94,5,"Marie died in hospital from appendicitis,"
94,6,she was 18 years old.
94,7,"She was a quiet girl,"
94,8,the mother was hysterical when she found out her daughter died.
94,9,She started to accuse the hospital of killing her daughter.
94,10,"It was a complete shock to the whole family as well,"
94,11,"they expected Marie to leave hospital that day and go home,"
94,12,but she passed away
94,13,as the mother had her back to Marie.
95,1,My daughter died
95,2,"when she was 28,"
95,3,on the 30th day of the month
95,4,at the Methodist hospital.
95,5,She had gone for an operation
95,6,on her appendix.
95,7,I sent my other daughter Victoria in
95,8,to see her
95,9,and when she got there
95,10,she noticed a chair in the room.
95,11,She asked what the chair was for
95,12,and she was told
95,13,"that they were going to move Marie into it,"
95,14,but Victoria said she was too sick.
95,15,Marie ends up passing out
95,16,when they tried to move her.
95,17,It is 10 days after her operation
95,18,when Marie dies.
95,19,I go to the hospital
95,20,to collect her
95,21,"when she is meant to be discharged,"
95,22,I have my coat on my arm.
95,23,The nurse’s aide brings blankets
95,24,because I'm having cold shivers.
95,25,I pray for another woman in the hospital
95,26,who has had an operation for gall stones;
95,27,she has 10 children.
95,28,They then rush
95,29,to my daughter
95,30,and when I go into her room
95,31,she is dead.
95,32,I keep screaming
95,33,that they have killed my daughter.
95,34,"Apparently, she was walking with another girl"
95,35,and said she had pain in her leg;
95,36,it was a blood clot that killed her.
95,37,When I tell
95,38,my husband
95,39,and son Michael
95,40,"the news about Marie,"
95,41,they both have heart attacks.
95,42,Some family arrive
95,43,and one of the women has brought a very large orange with her.
95,44,People remember Marie
95,45,standing on the step
95,46,"as a young,"
95,47,quiet girl.
96,1,A woman called Mrs. Costa is recalling
96,2,"the death of her daughter Marie 28 years ago,"
96,3,who died in hospital after an operation.
96,4,She got a call to come and collect her
96,5,"so gathered her belongings and some clothes,"
96,6,but by the time she arrived
96,7,the girl had passed out
96,8,"and was being worked on by doctors,"
96,9,and then passed away from a suspected blood clot.
96,10,The woman is screaming in the hospital.
96,11,Her other daughter Rita eventually arrives
96,12,"with her own husband,"
96,13,"after her mother hasn't returned home,"
96,14,and also discovers Marie has died.
96,15,They then return home
96,16,and the rest of the family find out.
96,17,"Her husband has a heart attack,"
96,18,then later so does her son Michael.
96,19,The youngest son James is told
96,20,to run and tell his aunt Milly and aunt Jenny
96,21,"and does so,"
96,22,he arrives with red eyes
96,23,and tells them Marie has died
96,24,after they ask what’s wrong.
96,25,28 years later Rita still suffers
96,26,with terrible pain in her leg.
97,1,Her daughter died twenty years ago at Methodist Hospital
97,2,(It was) due to (an) operation for appendicitis
97,3,Back then they used a lot of ether
97,4,Victoria saw the chair in the hospital
97,5,(and) asked the nurse what it was doing there

97,7,but she collapsed
97,8,(and) was taken back to bed
97,9,She was waiting for a call from the hospital
97,10,(and) her neighbor at the store passed her the information
97,11,(to) go and pick Marie
97,12,She ordered for coffee to be made
97,13,as they prepare to go (and) pick Marie
97,14,Marie saw her with the girls
97,15,(and) shouted
97,16,She was welcomed by the nurse
97,17,(and) she was asked whether her daughter had a fainting spell
97,18,She yelled upon seeing her daughter
97,19,(saying) they killed her
97,20,(and) she was ready to go home
97,21,The hospital kept calling
97,22,(and) the people in the office had no information (about) what happened
97,23,They thought (the) mother got angry because of Marie
97,24,The nurses kept coming
97,25,(and) they all knew her
97,26,(and) told her to keep away
97,27,Rita came
97,28,(and) told (her that) Marie was dead
97,29,(and) she fainted
97,30,Marie's friend said (that) Marie was saying goodbye
97,31,She threatened to kill whoever tried to touch her daughter
97,32,She was in a mess
97,33,Relatives and friends visited with oranges
97,34,She got home (and) called everybody
97,35,(telling them) what happened
97,36,They kept on saying how Marie was good
98,1,My daughter died.
98,2,"Twenty-eight years ago it'll be this Wednesday, yeah."
98,3,"She was in hospital, getting operated on for appendicitis."
98,4,"My eldest daughter Victoria went in to see her,"
98,5,"and, at that time I didn't have a phone."
98,6,But the girl at the store had a phone
98,7,"and the hospital called her to let me know to come pick Marie up,"
98,8,she had been discharged.
98,9,"Twenty-eight, no, thirtieth this month it'll be, yeah."
98,10,"She said to me, ""Mrs. Costa"", she said,"
98,11,"""The hospital called for you to pick up Marie."""
98,12,"So I got ready to go,"
98,13,"I told my daughter Rita to keep cooking,"
98,14,"and I said, ""Put a pot of coffee on, Daddy will be home soon."""
98,15,He was working that day.
98,16,"I always put out coffee for Marie,"
98,17,the first coffee of the day was hers.
98,18,"But when my eldest daughter Victoria got there,"
98,19,"she got to the bed Marie was at,"
98,20,and right next to it was a chair.
98,21,"She said to the nurse, ""What's this chair doing here?"""
98,22,"The nurse said ""We need to get her out of bed."""
98,23,but she was still under ether.
98,24,Back then they used a lot of ether.
98,25,"So she said to the nurse, ""She can't get out of bed, she's still under ether."
98,26,"She's still sick."""
98,27,"Then the nurse said, ""Well that's doctor's orders,"""
98,28,"so she goes to get Marie up,"
98,29,and she took a few steps then she collapsed on the floor.
98,30,"She was never - they asked, ""Does she have any fainting spells?"""
98,31,and she was healthy.
98,32,"So they called the girl at the store,"
98,33,"and she tells me to go to the hospital,"
98,34,"and I go, with Marie's coat on my arm,"
98,35,"and her undercoat,"
98,36,and her coat on my arm.
98,37,"I got there and the nurse's aide, she was a little thing,"
98,38,she said something to me.
98,39,"The nurse tells me to ""Just sit right here, sit down for a little while."""
98,40,and I got chills.
98,41,"Then I see the nurse's aide go into a closet and get a blanket out,"
98,42,"then she turns to the nurse and says, ""she's got cold sweat."""
98,43,"Then they started running,"
98,44,"and I saw it, and I'm not exaggerating,"
98,45,"there were huge beads of sweat, just running, just pouring down her face."
98,46,I got closer to her
98,47,"and I started yelling at the nurses, ""What did you do to her? You killed her. You killed her!"""
98,48,"See, the nurses knew me, I had three operations there in no time, less than a year."
98,49,"They just kept coming,"
98,50,"and I was yelling, ""You killed her! You killed her!"""
98,51,"The doctor rushes in,"
98,52,"and - she was a lady doctor, Dr Schwartes."
98,53,"The doctor, a lady doctor, tried to give me a shot."
98,54,"And I said to them, ""Get away from me! You killed my daughter, and now you're trying to kill me?"""
98,55,"I started screaming, I was hysterical,"
98,56,"banging my head against the wall and everything,"
98,57,"I had hair pulled out,"
98,58,I was a mess.
98,59,"My husband had got home,"
98,60,"gone upstairs to shave and shower,"
98,61,then sat on the steps waiting for Marie to come home.
98,62,"The hospital called the girl at the store again,"
98,63,"and said, ""Where's the mother? Tell the mother to come to the hospital."""
98,64,"The girl said, ""That's strange, the mother already went to the hospital, she should be there."""
98,65,Then they went up from the office.
98,66,"Then just as I turned my back,"
98,67,my daughter had passed away.
98,68,"I was screaming, crying, just a mess,"
98,69,and the lady doctor - they were all trying to get me to calm down.
98,70,But she was only eighteen.
98,71,I went home and told everybody what happened.
98,72,"My brother-in-law, he's an undertaker."
98,73,I called my sisters.
98,74,"I sent my youngest son, James, to tell his Aunties what happened."
98,75,They thought Marie would be coming home that day.
98,76,"They were cleaning the pavement, and doing the cement work, and cleaning the pavement."
98,77,"As soon as they saw little Jamie come up,"
98,78,"they could see his eyes were all red,"
98,79,"and they said to him, ""Jamie, honey, what's happened? Why are you crying?"""
98,80,"He said to them, ""Aunt Millie, Aunt, Marie's died. She died at hospital."""
98,81,"When my husband came down from the steps,"
98,82,"I told him,"
98,83,"and no kidding, he had a heart attack, yeah."
98,84,A heart attack.
98,85,"Then, my oldest son Michael came home,"
98,86,"and I told him,"
98,87,and he had a heart attack too.
98,88,"Both of them, yeah."
98,89,He collapsed on the floor.
98,90,"Everybody was coming out, they could hear the screams."
98,91,"I was hysterical, my hair was all pulled out, see."
98,92,It'll be thirty years this month.
98,93,"Yeah, thirty years."
98,94,She was only eighteen.
99,1,"The daughter died,"
99,2,"as did Aunt Jennie,"
99,3,"and Auntie Millie,"
99,4,"Mrs. Costa brought some cakes,"
99,5,"from the bakery,"
99,6,"at quarter to five,"
99,7,at night.
99,8,"She did,"
99,9,"of a blood clot,"
99,10,"Dr. Swartz killed her,"
99,11,"The mother told her,"
99,12,not to touch her daughter.
99,13,An orange was brought.
99,14,"The brother-in-law was called,"
99,15,it was cold outside.
99,16,"When Marie was discharged,"
99,17,"someone was to go to the hospital,"
99,18,"and pick her up,"
99,19,"all her clothes were laid out,"
99,20,ready.
99,21,"Rita was told to finish cooking,"
99,22,"as daddy would be home soon,"
99,23,he was working in the yard.
99,24,"Coffee was requested,"
99,25,"as she wanted some,"
99,26,"first thing in the morning was best,"
99,27,I never forget that she liked it.
101,1,A mother was recalling events
101,2,of how her 18-year-old daughter Marie died
101,3,due to (I believe they said) a blood clot.
101,4,She had been transferred
101,5,from a bed to a chair
101,6,which could have caused it (?).
101,7,I believe I read something
101,8,about her husband and son
101,9,having a heart attack as well (?).
101,10,Which was confusing
101,11,because then the son told her sisters
101,12,that were waiting back at home
101,13,that Marie had passed.
101,14,The dad/husband was also at home
101,15,excitingly waiting for Marie.
101,16,The mom had told the dad
101,17,to prep coffee for Marie
101,18,for when she's back
101,19,and they had also prepped something else
101,20,that I cannot recall.
101,21,If I recall correctly
101,22,the surgery happened
101,23,due to appendicitis.
101,24,The mom was also screaming in the hospital
101,25,at the doctors and nurses
101,26,that they had killed her daughter.
101,27,They used lots of ether.
101,28,They did not have a phone
101,29,so they were informed
101,30,by a grocery store phone (?).
