0,"My daughter died, twenty-eight years ago. I remember when she was at the hospital, they were moving everyone out of their beds. They tried to move her. I told them not to move her from her bed because she was under ether. I told them that Marie was under ether and not to move her. They tried to move her anyway, and when they did, she collapsed. She probably got a blood clot from it because they were talking about what could've caused it. I still remember that day, I was at home and they called me to say that Marie was being discharged from the hospital. I had all the clothes laid out on the table. My husband was at work. I went there and I was praying for this woman who had a gall bladder operation. I was praying to God to not take away this mother from her daughters. I saw a nurse running and she came and asked me something. I asked her if she was running for my daughter, and she said yes, come in. I went in and saw my daughter sweating. The beads of sweat were huge. I started screaming ""You killed her, You killed my daughter!"" A lady doctor Ms. Montique who was an assistant to the doctor who performed the surgery came to speak to me. I screamed very loudly, they wanted to inject me with something. I told them ""You killed my daughter and now you want to kill me."" The receptionist kept calling my home to tell us to come and pick up Marie since she was discharged. My daughter told them that I had already left for the hospital. They all came quickly because they were worried about me. They took me back home. I started screaming when we reached home, I was still in the car. People were coming out of their homes to check what was going on. I kept screaming ""They killed her!"". My husband was sitting on the porch, and he asked me what was going on. I told him ""Marie is dead, they killed her."" I showed them pictures of my daughter, she was only eighteen. When her sister and my husband found out, they collapsed. I told my youngest son to go and tell my sisters Auntie Jenny and Auntie Millie what had happened. When he went to tell them what had happened, they thought he was coming to tell them that Marie had come back home but when they found out, they were shocked. My sister brought an orange earlier, a big orange, nothing like I had ever seen before. The local store owner praised Marie a lot, she said that Marie would always come to the store and stand there, pointing at the steps. ""She would always stand there and look over"", She was a quiet girl, not much to talk. She was a good girl, Marie. - So that's what happened.","My child passed away, it was twenty-eight years back. I recall her time in the hospital, where they were clearing the beds of patients. They attempted to relocate her. I insisted they shouldn't shift her from her bed, since she was under the influence of anesthesia. I warned them about Marie being anesthetized, urging them not to transfer her. Nevertheless, they proceeded to attempt moving her, and as they did so, she fell to the ground. It's likely she developed a blood clot from that action, given they speculated about the potential causes. That day remains etched in my memory, while I was at my residence, receiving a call informing me of Marie's imminent release from medical care. I had prepared all her garments on the tabletop. My spouse was occupied at his job. I made my way there, offering prayers for a lady who had undergone gallbladder surgery. I beseeched the Almighty not to deprive this mother of her children. Observing a nurse in haste, she approached and inquired something of me. I questioned whether she was hastening on account of my child, to which she responded affirmatively, beckoning me inside. Entering, I beheld my daughter drenched in perspiration. The sweat droplets were enormous. I began to shriek, ""You have slain her, you have slain my child!"" Dr. Montique, an associate of the surgeon, approached to converse with me. I yelled out with great volume, and they sought to administer an injection to me. I protested, ""You've taken my child's life, now you aim to take mine."" The front desk persistently phoned my residence to prompt us to collect Marie since she was ready for discharge. My child informed them I had already departed for the medical facility. Concerned for my well-being, they all arrived swiftly. They escorted me back to my abode. Upon arriving home, I began to wail, still seated in the automobile. Neighbors emerged from their dwellings to investigate the commotion. I continued to cry out, ""They have taken her life!"" My spouse was perched on the veranda, inquiring about the situation. I informed him, ""Marie has perished, they are to blame."" I presented them with photographs of my girl, who was merely eighteen years old. Upon hearing the news, her sister and my husband were overcome with grief. I instructed my youngest son to inform my siblings, Auntie Jenny and Auntie Millie, of the tragedy. As he relayed the news, they assumed he was announcing Marie's return home, but upon learning the truth, they were taken aback. Earlier, my sister had brought a large orange, an exceptionally sizable one, unlike any I had seen before. The proprietor of the local shop spoke highly of Marie, mentioning how she would frequently visit the store and pause there, gesturing towards the steps. ""She'd always pause there, gazing out,"" She was a reserved child, not one for much conversation. She was a virtuous child, that was Marie. - And so, that is the tale.",2916,137.95363695331872,0.04730920334475951

She had been admitted for a duration of 10 days and the medical staff had her leave her bed to prevent the formation of blood clots. Marie was looking forward to returning home. I brought her jacket along. As I made my way there my spouse was in the midst of shaving and preparing to greet her back at home, eagerly awaiting on our front step for her arrival.

However, Costa's story has an inconsistency from how I recall it here because she then goes on to say that her husband was waiting on the porch and asked what was wrong when she arrived and only sat in the car screaming. They sent one of their other children or grandchildren to notify other relatives. He seems to have been a child and was crying by the time he arrived, leading them to ask what was wrong before he broke the news. Costa then rambles a bit more about unnecessary details but I don't remember them because they weren't key to the story.","Ms. Costa's offspring, Marie, was undergoing treatment for a sickness in the hospital. Toward the conclusion of her hospitalization, on the anticipated day of her release, the medical staff encouraged Marie to take a walk within her room. Ms. Costa is of the opinion that this activity resulted in a clot forming in her daughter's leg, which tragically caused her demise at the moment she was to leave the hospital. On the scheduled day for her return home, the family was eagerly anticipating her arrival. A message was relayed via a nearby shop informing them that she was ready to leave the hospital didn't they possess a telephone? They made all the necessary preparations for Marie's return. They had arranged for coffee and a morning meal and Ms. Costa set out alone to fetch Mary. Her spouse and their other child remained at home to finish the preparations. At that point, additional relatives were alerted about Marie's expected discharge that day. Ms. Costa mentions she had arranged clothing and various items and took coats and garments with her to the hospital. Upon arrival at the hospital, Ms. Costa was instructed to wait. She waited alongside another patient who was recovering from gallbladder surgery and offered prayers for her well-being, given her large family. During the wait, she observed some healthcare workers sprinting towards a patient. Ms. Costa soon discovered that they were hurrying to attend to an urgent situation involving Marie, who had suffered from a clot in her leg. She was escorted to Marie's room. Marie appeared to be in distress, profusely sweating and exhibiting a rigid leg. Ms. Costa began to lose her composure and act aggressively as the physicians scrambled to address the crisis. Amidst the chaos, Marie lost her battle with the clot. Ms. Costa, overwhelmed with fury, began to accuse the hospital of causing her daughter's death and protested against their offer of a sedative, claiming it was an attempt on her life as well. After a while, her husband and other child reached the hospital, driven by worry due to the absence of any news. It was then that they were informed of Marie's passing. Nevertheless, there's a discrepancy in Ms. Costa's account as I remember it since she later states that her husband was on the porch waiting and inquired about the situation upon her return, then simply sat in the car, overcome by screams. They dispatched one of their other offspring or grandchildren to inform the rest of the family. This messenger appeared to be a child and was in tears upon arrival, prompting questions about the issue before he delivered the tragic update. Ms. Costa continues with more tangential details which I don't recall as they were not crucial to the narrative.",2741,44.89984383114343,0.016380825914317193

I was already praying for another woman I knew—someone from my sister's neighborhood. She had just had an operation. She had ten kids. I was pleading with God not to take her away from them. But as I sat there, things started to take a turn. I was getting chills. A nurse's aide even brought me a blanket. I was trying to shake off the feeling when the nurse said to me, “Has your daughter ever had a fainting spell?” And right then, my heart sank. I rushed to the room. I saw my daughter Marie lying there. Her slippers still on. Sweat just pouring off of her. I couldn't believe it—I just kept yelling, ""What did you do to her? You killed my daughter!"" The doctors were trying to explain. All I could hear was them telling me they didn’t know what had happened. My beautiful Marie... she was only 18. I was hysterical. I was pulling at my hair, screaming. She was supposed to come home that day. We had everything ready. My husband was waiting at home for her. Sitting on the step. Not knowing what was about to happen. When the hospital called the store, they asked, ""When is the mother coming to pick up Marie?"" But my family, who was with me, knew something wasn't right. They all rushed back to the hospital. Thinking maybe I had gotten sick myself because of my heart condition. But when they arrived. They saw me in the state I was in. They knew. I told them, ""We lost Marie. Marie died."" It was chaos. My daughter Rita collapsed on the floor. As if struck by lightning. She heard the news. She’s been suffering ever since. Dealing with pain that comes and goes. Doctors later said it was a blood clot that caused Marie’s death. The girl who was with her said the last thing Marie complained about was pain in her leg.

At that moment, my heart plummeted. I hurried to the ward. There lay my daughter Marie, motionless. Her footwear was still intact. She was drenched in sweat. In disbelief, I kept shouting, 'What have you done to her? You've taken my daughter's life!' The physicians were attempting to provide an explanation. All that reached my ears was their admission of uncertainty about what had transpired. My dear Marie... she was merely 18 years old. I was in a state of hysteria.

I sent my other daughter Victoria in to see her and when she got there she noticed a chair in the room. She asked what the chair was for and she was told that they were going to move Marie into it, but Victoria said she was too sick. Marie ends up passing out when they tried to move her. It is 10 days after her operation when Marie dies. I go to the hospital to collect her when she is meant to be discharged, I have my coat on my arm. The nurse’s aide brings blankets because I'm having cold shivers. I pray for another woman in the hospital who has had an operation for gall stones; she has 10 children. They then rush to my daughter and when I go into her room she is dead. I keep screaming that they have killed my daughter. Apparently, she was walking with another girl and said she had pain in her leg; it was a blood clot that killed her. When I tell my husband and son Michael the news about Marie, they both have heart attacks. Some family arrive and one of the women has brought a very large orange with her. People remember Marie standing on the step as a young, quiet girl.","My child passed away at the age of 28, on the last day of the month within the walls of the Methodist hospital. She was there for a surgical procedure involving her appendix. I had my other child, Victoria, go in to visit her and upon her arrival she spotted a chair in the room. She inquired about the purpose of the chair and was informed that they intended to transfer Marie to it, but Victoria felt she was too ill. Marie ultimately loses consciousness during their attempt to transfer her. It's 10 days post-surgery when Marie succumbs. I make my way to the hospital to bring her home at the time she's supposed to be released, with my coat draped over my arm. The aide hands me blankets as I'm overcome with chills. I offer prayers for another patient in the hospital who underwent gallstone surgery; she's a mother of 10. Suddenly, they hurry towards my daughter's room and as I enter her space I find her lifeless. I can't stop yelling that they are responsible for my daughter's death. It seems she was ambulating with another patient and complained of leg pain; a thrombus was the cause of her demise. Upon breaking the news to my spouse and our son Michael regarding Marie, they both suffer cardiac events. Relatives start to gather and a lady among them has brought a sizable orange. Memories of Marie linger as she stood on the porch as a child, reserved in nature.",1378,72.75620161880369,0.05279840465805783

98,"My daughter died. Twenty-eight years ago it'll be this Wednesday, yeah. She was in hospital, getting operated on for appendicitis. My eldest daughter Victoria went in to see her, and, at that time I didn't have a phone. But the girl at the store had a phone and the hospital called her to let me know to come pick Marie up, she had been discharged. Twenty-eight, no, thirtieth this month it'll be, yeah. She said to me, ""Mrs. Costa"", she said, ""The hospital called for you to pick up Marie."" So I got ready to go, I told my daughter Rita to keep cooking, and I said, ""Put a pot of coffee on, Daddy will be home soon."" He was working that day. I always put out coffee for Marie, the first coffee of the day was hers. But when my eldest daughter Victoria got there, she got to the bed Marie was at, and right next to it was a chair. She said to the nurse, ""What's this chair doing here?"" The nurse said ""We need to get her out of bed."" but she was still under ether. Back then they used a lot of ether. So she said to the nurse, ""She can't get out of bed, she's still under ether. She's still sick."" Then the nurse said, ""Well that's doctor's orders,"" so she goes to get Marie up, and she took a few steps then she collapsed on the floor. She was never - they asked, ""Does she have any fainting spells?"" and she was healthy. So they called the girl at the store, and she tells me to go to the hospital, and I go, with Marie's coat on my arm, and her undercoat, and her coat on my arm. I got there and the nurse's aide, she was a little thing, she said something to me. The nurse tells me to ""Just sit right here, sit down for a little while."" and I got chills. Then I see the nurse's aide go into a closet and get a blanket out, then she turns to the nurse and says, ""she's got cold sweat."" Then they started running, and I saw it, and I'm not exaggerating, there were huge beads of sweat, just running, just pouring down her face. I got closer to her and I started yelling at the nurses, ""What did you do to her? You killed her. You killed her!"" See, the nurses knew me, I had three operations there in no time, less than a year. They just kept coming, and I was yelling, ""You killed her! You killed her!"" The doctor rushes in, and - she was a lady doctor, Dr Schwartes. The doctor, a lady doctor, tried to give me a shot. And I said to them, ""Get away from me! You killed my daughter, and now you're trying to kill me?"" I started screaming, I was hysterical, banging my head against the wall and everything, I had hair pulled out, I was a mess. My husband had got home, gone upstairs to shave and shower, then sat on the steps waiting for Marie to come home. The hospital called the girl at the store again, and said, ""Where's the mother? Tell the mother to come to the hospital."" The girl said, ""That's strange, the mother already went to the hospital, she should be there."" Then they went up from the office. Then just as I turned my back, my daughter had passed away. I was screaming, crying, just a mess, and the lady doctor - they were all trying to get me to calm down. But she was only eighteen. I went home and told everybody what happened. My brother-in-law, he's an undertaker. I called my sisters. I sent my youngest son, James, to tell his Aunties what happened. They thought Marie would be coming home that day. They were cleaning the pavement, and doing the cement work, and cleaning the pavement. As soon as they saw little Jamie come up, they could see his eyes were all red, and they said to him, ""Jamie, honey, what's happened? Why are you crying?"" He said to them, ""Aunt Millie, Aunt, Marie's died. She died at hospital."" When my husband came down from the steps, I told him, and no kidding, he had a heart attack, yeah. A heart attack. Then, my oldest son Michael came home, and I told him, and he had a heart attack too. Both of them, yeah. He collapsed on the floor. Everybody was coming out, they could hear the screams.","My child passed away. It's been twenty-eight years, coming up this Wednesday, indeed. She was undergoing surgery for appendicitis in the hospital. Victoria, my oldest, went to visit her, and at that time, I was without a telephone. However, the local store's clerk had one and the hospital contacted her to inform me that I should collect Marie, as she had been released. Actually, it's the thirtieth of this month, that's right. She addressed me, saying, ""Mrs. Costa"", ""You've been called by the hospital to fetch Marie."" So I prepared myself to leave, I instructed my daughter Rita to continue with the cooking, and I mentioned, ""Make some coffee, Dad will be back shortly."" He was on the job that day. I always made coffee for Marie, her first cup was always reserved for her. But when Victoria, my eldest, arrived there, she approached the bed where Marie was, and noticed a chair right beside it. She questioned the nurse, ""Why is this chair here?"" The nurse replied, ""We need to have her out of the bed."" yet she was still affected by the anesthesia. Back in those days, they used an excessive amount of anesthesia. So she told the nurse, ""She can't leave the bed, she's under the influence of anesthesia. She's not well."" Then the nurse responded, ""Those are the doctor's instructions,"" so Victoria attempted to help Marie stand, but Marie took a few steps and then fell to the ground. She had never been prone to fainting, they inquired, ""Does she faint often?"" and she was in good health. So they reached out to the store clerk, and she instructed me to head to the hospital, and off I went, carrying Marie's coat, along with her undergarment, and her coat draped over my arm. Upon arrival, the nurse's aide, a petite woman, uttered something to me. The nurse advised me to ""Please sit here, rest for a bit."" and a shiver ran through me. Then I watched the nurse's aide retrieve a blanket from a closet, and she remarked to the nurse, ""she's perspiring coldly."" Suddenly, they began to hurry, and I witnessed it, without any exaggeration, massive sweat droplets were streaming, cascading down her face. I moved closer to her and I confronted the nurses, shouting, ""What have you done? You've taken her life. You've taken her life!"" You see, the nurses were familiar with me, as I had undergone three surgeries there within a year. They kept arriving, while I continued to shout, ""You've taken her life! You've taken her life!"" The doctor made a quick entrance, and it was Dr. Schwartes, a female doctor. This doctor, a woman, attempted to administer a shot to me. And I rebuffed them, saying, ""Stay back! You've taken my child's life, now you want to take mine?"" I began to scream, completely hysterical, banging my head against the wall, among other things, with clumps of my hair coming out, I was completely distraught. My spouse had just arrived home, went up to shave and take a shower, then sat on the staircase awaiting Marie's return. The hospital contacted the store clerk once more, and said, ""Where is the mother? She needs to come to the hospital."" The clerk thought it odd, remarking, ""The mother has already left for the hospital, she ought to be there by now."" Then they proceeded from the office. And just as I looked away, my daughter had taken her last breath. I was wailing, weeping, in complete disarray, and the female doctor - they all tried to soothe me. Yet she was merely eighteen years old. I returned home and relayed the tragic news to everyone. My brother-in-law, who is a funeral director, I phoned my sisters. I sent my youngest, James, to inform his aunts of the incident. They were expecting Marie to arrive home that day. They were tidying the walkway, working on the cement, and cleaning the sidewalk. As soon as they saw young Jamie approaching, noticing his tearful eyes, they asked him, ""Jamie, dear, what's wrong? Why the tears?"" He told them, ""Aunt Millie, Aunt, Marie's gone. She passed away in the hospital."" When my husband descended the stairs, I broke the news to him, and truly, he suffered a heart attack, indeed. A cardiac arrest. Later, when my eldest son Michael arrived, I informed him as well, and he too experienced a heart attack. Both of them, indeed. He fell to the ground. Everyone emerged, alerted by the screams.",4280,344.9137246251414,0.08058731883764986

101,A mother was recalling events of how her 18-year-old daughter Marie died due to (I believe they said) a blood clot. She had been transferred from a bed to a chair which could have caused it (?). I believe I read something about her husband and son having a heart attack as well (?). Which was confusing because then the son told her sisters that were waiting back at home that Marie had passed. The dad/husband was also at home excitingly waiting for Marie. The mom had told the dad to prep coffee for Marie for when she's back and they had also prepped something else that I cannot recall. If I recall correctly the surgery happened due to appendicitis. The mom was also screaming in the hospital at the doctors and nurses that they had killed her daughter. They used lots of ether. They did not have a phone so they were informed by a grocery store phone (?).,"A mother was reminiscing about past events regarding the tragic death of her daughter Marie, who was 18 which was reportedly caused by a blood clot. She had been moved from her bed to a seat which might have triggered the clot (?). I recall reading something concerning her spouse and child also suffering from cardiac arrests (?). This was perplexing since the son then informed her sisters who were awaiting news at home about Marie's demise. The father and husband was at home too eagerly anticipating Marie's return. The mother had instructed the father to prepare coffee for Marie for her arrival and they had made ready something else too which slips my mind. As far as I remember the operation was performed because of an appendicitis. The mother was also yelling in the hospital at the medical staff accusing them of causing her daughter's death. An excessive amount of ether was used. Lacking a telephone they received the news through a call from a grocery store's phone (?).",985,9.690132612319246,0.009837698083572839
