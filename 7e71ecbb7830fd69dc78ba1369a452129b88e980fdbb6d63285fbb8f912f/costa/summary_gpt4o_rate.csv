Rita, taken aback, lost consciousness. Now, Rita periodically endures pain in her legs. A confidant relayed Marie's final utterances to the physician. Marie had complained about leg discomfort before she collapsed. Posthumously, the doctors attributed it to a thrombosis. I wouldn't permit them to lay hands on Marie's remains. My wails echoed as I was escorted home. The commotion of my cries drew the neighbors outside. My spouse was shattered by the tragic update. The shock precipitated a cardiac arrest in him. My son Michael also suffered a cardiac event. My sisters were expectantly awaiting Marie's return. They had brought a sizable orange for her. I dispatched little James to break the news to them.
