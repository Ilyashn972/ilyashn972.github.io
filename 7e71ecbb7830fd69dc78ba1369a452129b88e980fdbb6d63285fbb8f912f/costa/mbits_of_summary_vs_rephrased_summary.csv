I was questioned by a nurse about Marie's history with fainting spells. When I hurried to Marie's side, I found her drenched in sweat. I blamed the staff for my daughter's suffering. Tragically, Marie passed away as I turned my back for a moment. Overcome with grief, I became hysterical within the hospital walls. Meanwhile, my husband was at home, expecting our daughter's return. The hospital staff was initially clueless about the tragedy. Rita, thinking I was just overly emotional, believed I needed support. She and my son-in-law came to find me in a state of turmoil. Although a nurse attempted to soothe me, I rejected any help. Marie had mentioned her leg was hurting before she died. The doctors later confirmed a blood clot as the cause of her demise. I warned the hospital staff not to lay a finger on my child. My loud cries left me in a state of disarray and agony. The devastating news caused my husband to have a heart attack. My son Michael also had a heart attack subsequently. My sisters had been eagerly anticipating Marie's return. It fell upon my son James to convey the tragic update. Our neighbors fondly recalled Marie's gentle and amiable demeanor.",551.98,1623,0.34,30_3

Her life came to an end at Methodist Hospital following an appendectomy. The surgery took place on a late Saturday, and by Sunday morning when my other daughter visited, she was still recovering from the anesthesia. In an attempt to mobilize her, she fainted, which I believe led to a fatal blood clot. Without a phone of my own, news of her impending discharge was relayed to me by a local shopkeeper. I made arrangements to bring her home, knowing she was looking forward to a cup of coffee. I could see her through the hospital's glass panes. Upon arrival, I was asked to settle a ten-dollar fee for her release. A nurse then urged me to sit, and as I offered prayers for another, I was hit with the news that my daughter's health had taken a turn for the worse. I found her drenched in sweat in her room, and I couldn't help but accuse the staff of causing her demise. The physician was at a loss for an explanation. Tragically, she passed away as I looked away, despite our anticipation of her return home. My husband was among those awaiting her. Despite repeated calls from the hospital for her collection, my daughter Rita sensed something amiss. Accompanied by her husband, she rushed to the hospital. Overwhelmed by grief, I declined any medical help. Rita was overcome with shock and collapsed upon learning of Marie's passing. Marie had previously complained of leg pain and blurry vision before she collapsed. The medical team concluded that a blood clot was the cause of her death. I strictly prohibited any post-mortem contact with her body. Returning home, I was engulfed by shock and grief. The news triggered a heart attack in my husband, and my son Michael also suffered one. The entire family and our neighbors were deeply affected by the tragedy of Marie's passing.

A nurse had plans to help her out of bed, despite Victoria's concerns. The doctor had given orders for her to be mobilized. She collapsed during the attempt, which I believe led to the formation of a fatal blood clot. We were all anticipating her return home. At that time, I didn't own a telephone. The news of her discharge came through a call from a local store owner. I had her garments prepared and coffee brewing in anticipation of her arrival. As I went to collect her, she spotted me from the hospital window. Unexpectedly, I was asked to settle additional boarding charges and to bring her girdle. When I reached the hospital, I met with a nurse and offered prayers for another patient. I was informed that Marie had experienced a fainting episode. Upon entering her room, I found Marie in her housecoat and slippers, drenched in sweat. I confronted the staff, accusing them of causing my daughter's death. When the female doctor arrived, they were unable to provide an explanation for the tragedy. Overcome with emotion, I became hysterical. Marie was a mere eighteen years old when she passed away before my eyes, just as we were expecting her to return home. Her father was waiting for her phone call, while the hospital kept contacting the store. Rita assumed I was just overly agitated. My son-in-law came to the hospital, finding me in the main hallway, inconsolable. I rejected any medical help, and they had to restrain me physically. After I informed Rita of Marie's death, she collapsed onto the marble floor, later experiencing pain from the shock.

Despite Marie's groggy state, a nurse insisted on moving her from her bed, which led to Marie losing consciousness. I hold the hospital accountable for a fatal blood clot that developed. When it was time for her discharge, the hospital contacted me, but lacking a home phone, the message was conveyed through the local store owner. I was getting ready to bring Marie home, a place where she longed for her usual coffee. In my absence, Rita took over the kitchen duties. I brought Marie's clothes with me to the hospital, where she spotted me from her room window. The hospital staff mentioned additional charges for her stay, and a nurse suggested I wait there. During that time, I offered prayers for another patient who was a mother to many. Anxiety overtook me as I waited, and I was soon informed that Marie had fainted. I hurried to her bedside to find her drenched in sweat. I confronted the medical staff, accusing them of causing her death. Tragically, Marie died just as she was about to be released, with my husband waiting for her at home. The hospital kept calling the store to reach me. Rita, sensing my distress, arrived at the hospital with my son-in-law. I declined a sedative at the hospital and later suffered a breakdown in the corridor. After I told Rita about Marie's passing, she collapsed from the shock. Since then, Rita has experienced leg pain, which eerily mirrors the leg pain Marie complained about before she collapsed. I wouldn't allow the hospital staff to touch Marie post-mortem. The news of her passing sent shockwaves through our family, causing my husband and son to have heart attacks.

Her life ended on the last day of this month, within the walls of Methodist Hospital. Appendicitis had necessitated an operation for Marie, which was performed late into a Saturday evening. The following day, my other daughter, Victoria, went to see her, finding Marie still under the influence of anesthesia. Despite Victoria's apprehensions, a nurse pushed for Marie to get out of bed, citing the physician's instructions. When they attempted to move her, Marie lost consciousness, and I hold them responsible for the subsequent blood clot. Anticipating a call from the hospital to collect Marie, I was without a telephone back then. A neighbor informed me of her impending release, prompting me to ready myself for her homecoming, even brewing her morning coffee in anticipation. With her belongings in hand, I set off to fetch her, and she spotted me from the hospital window. There was a fee for her stay, and they requested her girdle. Upon my arrival, I was urged to sit, and I offered a prayer for another patient. It wasn't long before a nurse reported Marie's severe perspiration and inquired about her history of syncope. Chaos ensued as I realized the staff were frantically attending to Marie. I confronted them, accusing them of causing my daughter's demise. Her physicians, Dr. Schwartz and Dr. Montique, were present when she slipped away. Meanwhile, my husband awaited her return at home, unaware, as the hospital's calls went unanswered. My absence raised alarm, and my daughter Rita, accompanied by her husband, rushed to the hospital. They found me in a state of hysteria, and upon learning of Marie's passing, Rita was overcome with grief, a pain that has since plagued her legs. Marie had spoken of pain and a loss of vision before she fell unconscious, symptoms the doctors attributed to a blood clot. I denied them any further contact with her. The grim news was relayed to my husband, whose grief was shared by my son, both suffering heart attacks from the shock. The family and an undertaker were notified, and the community reeled from the sudden loss of Marie.",568.3,1881,0.3,46_2

The nurse led me to her, where I found her drenched in sweat on the bed. I confronted the hospital staff, accusing them of causing her death. The assistant doctor tried to speak with me, and the nurses attempted to soothe my distress, but I was overwhelmed by sorrow. Marie was a beautiful young woman of eighteen, and her father was at home awaiting her return. The hospital had been calling to check on my arrival. Rita and my son-in-law came to the hospital, where Rita collapsed from the shock and has since suffered from leg pain. After bidding farewell at the hospital, Marie succumbed to what doctors identified as a blood clot. I vehemently refused any postmortem procedures by the hospital. Overcome with emotion, I returned home to break the devastating news to my family. That night, both my husband and son suffered heart attacks.",568.72,1929,0.29,47_3

The surgery took place late on a Saturday, and by Sunday morning, when my other daughter, Victoria, went to see her, she was still not fully awake from the anesthesia. Despite Victoria's concerns, the nurse claimed they were following the doctor's instructions when they attempted to mobilize her, which led to her fainting.

I was anxiously awaiting news from the hospital, relying on a neighbor's phone for communication. When the message came that Marie was ready to be discharged, I eagerly prepared her clothes and brewed coffee, a gesture of our morning routine where she always had the first cup. With everything packed, including her girdle as requested, and additional payment for her hospital stay in hand, I arrived at the hospital. There, I was asked to sit and wait. In the meantime, I prayed for a mother of ten I had heard about, trying to distract myself from the growing sense of dread. The nurse mentioned Marie was overheating, which only heightened my fear. Upon seeing her in bed, drenched in sweat, I couldn't contain my accusation that they were responsible for her demise. The doctor's admission of uncertainty did nothing to console me. Urged to speak to Marie, I lost control, overcome with grief and disbelief. My beautiful, young Marie was gone in an instant, just as we were preparing to welcome her back home. My husband was among those anticipating her return, but instead, we were met with incessant calls from the hospital, stating she had been discharged. Rita, worried about my well-being, rushed to the hospital with my son-in-law. They found me in the corridor, inconsolable, my cries echoing off the walls as medical staff attempted to calm me.

Her passing occurred at the end of this month, years ago. She was a patient at Methodist Hospital, undergoing an appendectomy that took place on a late Saturday evening. The following day, Victoria paid her a visit, but Marie was still unconscious from the ether, which was commonly used at that time. Victoria was puzzled by a chair in the room, and upon inquiry, a nurse mentioned it was for Marie. Despite Victoria's protests that Marie was too unwell to be moved, the staff insisted on following the doctor's instructions. Tragically, Marie suffered a collapse during the transfer, which I believe led to a fatal blood clot. Ten days later, Marie was up and walking, and I was eagerly anticipating a call to bring her home. A local shopkeeper was the one who told me she was being discharged, as I didn't own a phone back then. I got her clothes ready and told Rita to finish up the cooking, while we brewed a pot of coffee, honoring the tradition of offering Marie the first cup. When I arrived to collect her, she spotted me from the hospital window. During a phone call, I learned about additional fees and that Marie needed a girdle. Upon my arrival, I was asked to take a seat, which filled me with dread. I prayed for a mother of ten, feeling a cold sensation as I waited. A nurse inquired if Marie had a history of fainting, which heightened my anxiety, fearing something was wrong with her. I discovered Marie in a state of heavy perspiration and accused the staff of causing her demise. The doctors were at a loss for what had transpired. Shortly after, Marie died, leaving me in a state of hysteria, with my appearance reflecting the turmoil within. At just eighteen, she was gone. The hospital continued to call for her discharge, unaware of the tragedy. Rita, puzzled by my absence, arrived with my son-in-law, only to find me in a state of distress, refusing medical attention. The news of Marie's death caused Rita to collapse, experiencing leg pain akin to phlebitis, a condition Marie had complained of, along with vision problems. An investigation later confirmed a blood clot was the cause. In my grief, I wouldn't let anyone near Marie, and my outburst spilled outside the hospital. The news was too much for my husband, who suffered a heart attack, as did my son Michael. Our family and neighbors were in disbelief, having expected Marie to return home that day.",713.26,2107,0.34,54_2

She succumbed to complications at Methodist Hospital following an appendectomy. My eldest daughter, Victoria, went to check on her and found her unconscious from the anesthesia. Despite this, the nurse urged Marie to get out of bed, which led to her fainting. I hold them responsible for the subsequent blood clot that formed. After a ten-day stay, Marie was up and about, ready to be discharged. I had prepared to greet her with coffee and cake at home. On my way to collect her from the hospital, I prayed for another patient in critical condition. A nurse inquired if Marie had a history of fainting, which was when I realized they were rushing to aid my own child. Marie was profusely sweating when I reached her, and I accused the staff of causing her death. She died shortly after I got there. My husband was at home, eagerly awaiting her return. The hospital, unaware of her demise, called to inform us she was ready to be picked up. Rita, my other daughter, assumed my distress was due to Marie's discharge, but when she and her husband arrived, they found me distraught in the corridor. Rita was so overwhelmed by the news of her sister's death that she fainted. Marie had complained of leg pain before she collapsed, and it was later confirmed she died from a blood clot. I wouldn't allow the hospital staff to touch her body. Upon returning home, my screams of sorrow were so intense that my husband suffered a heart attack, and my son Michael also collapsed from a cardiac event. My sisters had been anticipating Marie's return, and I had the heartbreaking task of informing them of her passing. My brother-in-law, the funeral director, was the one we called upon. My young son James had the difficult job of telling my aunts about the tragedy. The entire neighborhood was stunned by the news. Annie, from the local store, recalls seeing Marie on her doorstep, a quiet but exceptionally kind girl. The incident has left a deep scar on my heart and has profoundly affected our family over the years. Marie's untimely death has had an enduring effect on us all. We had been so hopeful for her recovery, but the medical staff was unable to provide any answers. Rita still experiences pain that stems from the trauma of losing Marie.

Despite her groggy state, the nurses insisted on getting her out of bed, a decision I hold responsible for the subsequent blood clot. She was scheduled to leave the hospital after ten days. On the day of her discharge, I received a call to collect her, and I prepared her favorite clothes and brewed some coffee in anticipation of her return. She glimpsed me from the hospital window. While I was at the hospital, the nurses advised me to take a seat. At that time, I was praying for another patient.

In my anguish, I rejected their offer of a sedative and refused to allow any post-mortem procedures on my daughter. Rita, overwhelmed by the situation, later experienced leg pain. It was revealed that Marie had complained of leg pain before she collapsed, and it was determined that a blood clot was the cause of her death. I was escorted home, my screams of sorrow reaching the ears of the neighbors, who came out to see what had happened. I had the heartbreaking task of telling my husband about our daughter's death, which led to him suffering a heart attack. My son Michael also experienced a heart attack. My siblings had been eagerly awaiting a call from Marie, and I had to break the devastating news to them and our friends. The entire community was stunned and deeply saddened by the loss of Marie, who was known for her quiet and amiable nature. The local storekeeper still speaks of her with great affection, and Annie always noticed her standing on the step. I have tried my best to convey the essence of Marie's character, as she was cherished by everyone who knew her. The tragedy has left an indelible mark on our emotions.

Rita was overcome with grief upon learning of Marie's death, a pain she has endured ever since. Marie's friend conveyed her final words, and a blood clot was the suspected cause. I made hostile declarations towards the hospital and barred them from accessing Marie's remains. The commotion of my cries drew the neighbors outside.

Upon arrival, I was informed of an additional ten-dollar charge for her girdle. After being asked to sit, I prayed for another patient, but soon felt a chill.

Back home, my husband and I awaited her return, unaware that the hospital's repeated calls were about her discharge. Sensing trouble, Rita, accompanied by my son-in-law, rushed to the hospital. Overcome with hysteria, I rejected their offer of sedation. It was from me that Rita first heard of Marie's passing, a revelation that caused her to collapse from the shock, resulting in weeks of leg pain. Marie had previously complained of leg discomfort and vision issues before collapsing from a clot. I forbade the hospital staff from further contact with her. I was escorted home in a state of screaming distress, where my husband awaited on the porch. The news of Marie's passing triggered his heart attack, and my son Michael also suffered one. My sisters were anxious for updates, and my younger sister arrived with an orange as a gesture of comfort. I made calls to inform the family, while my son James, an undertaker, was visibly emotional as he relayed the tragic news to other relatives. The entire family and neighborhood were stunned by Marie's untimely death. Annie, from the store, recalled Marie's gentle and amiable nature. I hold dear the memories of my daughter, whose loss marked a profound moment in our lives. The family grappled with the aftermath, deeply affected by the tragedy. Marie's presence continues to be felt, and our community joined us in our grief.

Despite Victoria's apprehensions about her sister's frail state, a nurse, adhering to the physician's instructions, insisted on getting her out of bed. This action led to her fainting, and I am convinced that it was this premature movement that triggered a fatal blood clot. I was waiting for the call to collect her after a ten-day recovery period. Without a personal phone, I depended on the local store's phone for communication. The store owner would relay messages from the hospital. When Marie was released, I began preparations to pick her up, brewing coffee she was fond of and instructing my other daughter, Rita, to continue with the meal preparations and to purchase some cake. Carrying Marie's clothes, I was filled with anticipation to reunite with her. She spotted me from the hospital window, but I was soon informed of additional fees for her extended stay. A nurse suggested I wait, and as I did, I prayed for another patient, feeling an ominous chill. The nurse's subsequent inquiry about Marie's medical history heightened my anxiety, fearing they were encountering complications with her. Upon entering her room, I found Marie in agony and confronted the staff, accusing them of negligence. A female doctor attempted to clarify the situation, but they failed to provide a clear explanation for Marie's sudden decline. In a state of hysteria, I blamed the hospital as Marie passed away amidst their frantic search for assistance. The expectation had been for her to come home, and my family was eagerly awaiting her return. Unfortunately, due to communication barriers, the hospital was unable to contact us. Rita and my son-in-law went to the hospital to find out what had happened, as I was too distraught to engage with the hospital staff. The confirmation of Marie's death shattered my family. Rita was particularly affected, carrying the anguish with her ever since. We believe a blood clot was the cause of Marie's untimely demise. I declined an autopsy, choosing not to subject her to further procedures. The tragic news spread rapidly among family and friends. The impact was so severe that my husband and son both suffered heart attacks, and my sisters were in utter shock, having expected Marie to come home that very day. In time, I notified all our relatives of the tragedy. The community held Marie in high regard, often reminiscing about her gentle and amiable demeanor. Her loss was an immense tragedy for everyone who knew her.",623.19,2308,0.27,49_2

She succumbed to complications at Methodist Hospital following an appendectomy performed on a late Saturday afternoon. The following day, Victoria went to see her and found her still affected by the anesthesia. Despite Victoria's protests due to her apparent weakness, a nurse insisted she be moved, a decision supported by the doctor. In the process of getting her up, she fainted, and I hold them responsible for the resulting blood clot from that action. I was anticipating a call to confirm her release from the hospital when the store owner informed me about Marie being discharged. I had arranged everything for her return, asked Rita to finish the meal preparations, and to start brewing coffee. As I approached the hospital, Marie spotted me from the window. Upon arrival, I was told about a ten-dollar board fee and brought the girdle Marie had requested. While waiting in the hospital as instructed by a nurse, I prayed for another patient who was in critical condition, all the while feeling anxious about Marie. A nurse revealed Marie was in a cold sweat, and upon entering her room, I found her drenched in sweat and lying in bed. I confronted the medical staff, accusing them of causing my daughter's death. Dr. Schwartz and his assistant were trying to intervene. In my anger, I yelled at them for their ignorance of her condition. When the nurse suggested I speak to Marie, I turned away, and that's when she died. She was all set to return home, where her father was waiting. The hospital had been persistent about her discharge. Rita thought my illness was due to the stress. She and her husband rushed to the hospital to find me in a state of hysteria. A doctor tried to calm me with sedation, which I vehemently refused. Rita discovered me in turmoil and collapsed herself upon learning of Marie's death. She experiences leg pain akin to phlebitis, a condition similar to what Marie had before her collapse. The doctors attributed Marie's death to a blood clot. I warned the hospital staff not to touch her, and I left the premises overwhelmed by grief. My anguished cries drew the neighbors, and I had to break the tragic news to my husband, who then suffered a heart attack, and my son, who also collapsed from the devastating news.",605.62,2318,0.26,57_1

Marie spotted me from a hospital window as she was about to leave, and an unexpected phone call increased her hospital bill by ten dollars because they wanted her to wear a girdle. Upon my arrival at the hospital, a nurse asked me to sit and wait. While waiting, I prayed for another patient and began to feel cold, which a petite nurse noticed. I was then summoned because Marie had fainted again. She was lying in a cold sweat, and the cause of her collapse was unknown. I accused the medical staff of causing her death. Dr. Montique, Dr. Schwartz's assistant, tried to soothe me, but I was inconsolable when Marie died at just eighteen. My husband was at home, unaware of the tragedy, anxiously awaiting her return. The office kept calling for Marie, which alarmed Rita enough to come to the hospital. Upon discovering Marie's death, Rita was so shocked that she fainted. The loss of her sister caused Rita immense grief. Marie had mentioned leg pain before she collapsed, and the doctors later suspected a blood clot was the cause of her death. I was so distraught that I refused any post-mortem examination. The news of her death sent me into hysteria, and upon learning of it, my husband suffered a heart attack, as did my son Michael that same night.

The procedure took place late on a Saturday, and by Sunday morning, when Victoria came to see her, Marie hadn't fully awakened from the anesthesia. A chair was placed beside her bed to assist her in getting up, which Victoria found curious and questioned the nurse about. The nurse explained it was on doctor's orders.

I confronted the medical staff, accusing them of causing her death. Although Dr. Schwartz performed the surgery, Dr. Montique was also there. I was urged to speak to Marie as she lay dying, which sent me into a state of uncontrollable grief. Marie died just as she was preparing to leave the hospital.

Her death occurred on the 30th of April. She had been admitted to Methodist Hospital for an appendectomy. The surgery took place on a late Saturday. The following day, my eldest daughter, Victoria, went to see her. She found Marie still affected by the ether. Victoria was puzzled by a chair in the room, which a nurse said was to help Marie get up, despite her appearing too ill for such activity. The nurse claimed it was on doctor's orders. When they tried to move her, Marie collapsed and had to be laid back down. I suspect that this action led to a fatal blood clot. She was scheduled to leave the hospital after ten days. I was waiting for a call to pick her up, but instead, a store clerk informed me she was being discharged. I had her clothes ready at home and left Rita to continue cooking and make coffee, which Marie enjoyed in the mornings. I took her clothes and went to the hospital, where Marie spotted me from a window while saying farewell to her friends. The hospital mentioned additional fees and reminded me to bring her girdle. I was asked to wait upon arrival. During this time, I prayed for another patient and felt a chill and began to sweat. A nurse asked about Marie's history of fainting, which alarmed me. I rushed in to find Marie in a state of distress, sweating heavily in bed. I accused the staff of causing her harm. A female doctor tried to explain, but they were clueless about the cause. I was hysterical as Marie passed away when I looked away. My husband was still expecting her to come home, and the hospital kept calling for her to be picked up. Rita thought my distress was due to stress. She and my son-in-law came looking for me and found me in the main hallway, overwhelmed with grief. The doctors couldn't soothe me. Rita was taken aback by my state and collapsed from the shock of Marie's death, which led to a persistent pain in her leg. The hospital later suggested a blood clot was the cause of death. I declined an autopsy, fearing further harm to her. My grief was uncontrollable, and I made a scene. The tragic news led to my husband having a heart attack, and my son Michael suffered one as well. Relatives gathered upon hearing the news, and neighbors remembered Marie for her quiet and kind nature.",726.71,2415,0.3,56_2

She succumbed to complications following an appendectomy at Methodist Hospital. Victoria had gone to see her post-operation and inquired about a chair in her room, which the nurse said was to assist in getting her up. Despite her frail state, they attempted to move her, and she fainted. I hold the hospital accountable for the blood clot that formed. I was anticipating a call to bring her home after ten days, but instead, a store clerk informed me of her impending discharge. I readied her garments and brewed coffee in anticipation of her arrival. She glimpsed me from the hospital's window. Additional fees for her extended stay were required. While waiting, a nurse suggested I take a seat, and during that time, I offered prayers for another patient undergoing surgery. The wait sent shivers down my spine. When questioned about my daughter's medical history by a nurse, I sensed the hospital's concern. She was perspiring profusely when I finally saw her, and I confronted the staff, accusing them of negligence. Amidst the turmoil, the doctors sought to pacify me, but Dr. Montique, the assistant physician, had no answers. At just eighteen, my daughter's life ended as she was preparing to leave the hospital. My husband was at home, expecting her. The hospital's calls for me to collect her persisted. Rita sensed trouble when I didn't come back, and given my heart condition, the stress only exacerbated it. Rita and her spouse rushed to the hospital. The doctors proposed a sedative to help me cope, but I was too distraught and refused. The hospital staff knew me well from past visits. Rita was overcome with grief upon learning of Marie's passing, and she has endured physical agony ever since. Marie had complained of leg pain and vision loss before collapsing, which was later attributed to a blood clot. I vehemently warned the hospital not to intervene with Marie. My screams on the journey home alerted the neighbors. I broke the devastating news to my husband, Mike, who suffered a heart attack from the shock. That same night, my son Michael also experienced a heart attack. My sisters had been eagerly awaiting Marie's homecoming. The neighborhood was expecting her return that day, but it was my young son who had to relay the heartbreaking news to my sisters and mother. The community was left in disbelief. Annie from the store often brings back memories of Marie, who was known for her quiet and amiable nature. The memory of the events haunts me, and I cherish the memories of Marie, missing her immensely.",718.76,2446,0.29,56_3

She succumbed to complications following an appendectomy at Methodist Hospital. The surgery took place late on a Saturday, and by Sunday morning, when my eldest, Victoria, visited, she found her still under the influence of anesthesia. Despite Victoria's objections, a nurse, adhering to the physician's instructions, insisted on moving her, which I believe led to a fatal blood clot. We were anticipating her return home after a ten-day hospital stay, and I had made all the necessary preparations. A call from a store employee informed me of her release, so I instructed my other daughter, Rita, to continue cooking as I planned to welcome Marie with coffee and cake. Upon arriving at the hospital with Marie's clothing, a nurse's request for me to sit down hinted at trouble. I prayed for another patient facing a grave operation, unaware of my own impending despair. Learning that Marie was experiencing a cold sweat, I was struck with fear for her well-being. Confronting the sight of Marie drenched in sweat, I blamed the medical staff for her demise. Dr. Montique, who had been part of the surgical team, was present, and I desperately sought explanations for the tragedy. Overwhelmed by hysteria, I couldn't accept that my eighteen-year-old, beautiful Marie was gone. She passed away in the brief moment I looked away, just as we were preparing for her homecoming. At home, my husband awaited her return, while the hospital repeatedly called to confirm her discharge. My family grew anxious about my absence, with Rita suspecting I was overwhelmed with worry. Rita and my son-in-law rushed to the hospital, finding me inconsolable in the office. They attempted to sedate me, but I refused any assistance from the hospital. Overcome with sorrow, I resorted to banging my head against the wall, and upon hearing of Marie's death, Rita fainted and later suffered from conditions similar to phlebitis. Marie had complained of leg pain and vision loss before she collapsed, with a blood clot ultimately being identified as the cause of death. I prohibited the hospital from further handling her body and returned home, engulfed in distress and hysteria, my screams alerting the neighbors. The devastating news of Marie's passing triggered a heart attack in my husband, and my son Michael also suffered a heart attack. My sisters had been eagerly awaiting a call about Marie's arrival, but instead, Jamie had to break the news of her passing. The entire family and neighborhood were left in shock by the tragedy. Annie from the store shared fond recollections of Marie, who was known for her quiet, pleasant nature. The community continues to remember Marie, and the incident has left an indelible mark on all of us.",717.63,2677,0.27,55_1

She succumbed to complications at Methodist Hospital following an appendectomy. The procedure was conducted late on a Saturday. The next morning, my other daughter, Victoria, came to see her, but Marie was still under the influence of anesthesia. A nurse attempted to mobilize Marie, but Victoria protested, sensing her sister's frailty. Despite this, Marie lost consciousness when they tried to move her. I hold the hospital accountable for the blood clot that took her life. Marie was scheduled to be discharged after ten days. The hospital notified a local store to relay the message of her release to me. I was getting ready for her return, setting aside her favorite clothes and brewing coffee, which she adored in the mornings. It's a memory that comes to mind with each morning's first cup. I instructed Rita, another daughter, to prepare a meal for Marie's homecoming. Upon arriving at the hospital to collect her, I was asked for ten dollars and a girdle for her discharge. While waiting, a nurse advised me to take a seat. I found myself praying for another mother there. Suddenly, I saw an aide fetching blankets, and learned Marie had suffered a fainting episode and was in a cold sweat. I was ushered into Marie's room, where she lay drenched in sweat. I confronted the staff, accusing them of causing her death. Dr. Montique, the assistant, claimed ignorance of the situation. A nurse encouraged me to speak to Marie, but I was beside myself with grief. At just eighteen, Marie was on the brink of returning home. My husband was anxiously awaiting her at our house. Calls from the hospital about her discharge persisted. Rita was puzzled by my delay in bringing Marie back. Eventually, Rita and my son-in-law came to find me at the hospital. I was distraught in the corridor. A doctor offered me a sedative, which I declined. I was uncooperative with the medical team's attempts to console me. Rita was devastated by the news of Marie's passing. Since then, she has been plagued by leg pain, an ailment Marie had mentioned just before her collapse. The doctors concluded that a blood clot was the cause of death. I vehemently refused to let anyone touch Marie's body, threatening the hospital staff with violence. I returned home in agony, my cries drawing the attention of neighbors. I broke the tragic news to my husband, Mike, who suffered a heart attack from the shock. That same night, my son Michael also experienced a heart attack. My sisters had been anticipating news of Marie's return, even bringing an orange for her. I had the heartbreaking task of informing everyone of her demise. My young son James relayed the news of Marie's passing to the family. The entire family was stunned by the loss.
