In a 1920s setting, we see Mrs. Costa from the back as she speaks on the phone inside a small local shop. It's a bright, clear early afternoon in spring. The shop is modestly furnished with simple decor, wooden shelves lined with period-appropriate goods, and a vintage telephone as she listens intently. Mrs. Costa, in simple early 20th-century attire, stands with her posture attentive, slightly hunched over the phone, reflecting her determination to resolve a situation regarding board fees and a girdle. Sunlight filters through a window, casting soft, warm shadows, adding to the historical ambiance.
