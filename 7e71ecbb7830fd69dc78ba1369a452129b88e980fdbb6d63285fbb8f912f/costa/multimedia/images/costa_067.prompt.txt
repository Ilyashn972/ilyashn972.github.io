In a 1920s hospital room, 18-year-old Marie, with long black hair, lies on the bed dressed in bedroom slippers and a housecoat, visibly distressed with large beads of sweat, without her face being visible. Nearby, Mrs. Costa stands, her face also not seen, embodying profound concern and fear for her daughter. The room reflects early 20th-century simplicity with functional decor. Afternoon sunlight softly illuminates the space, enhancing the tense yet hopeful ambiance.
