Set in the 1920s, the room is softly lit with antique-style lamps casting a warm glow over a polished marble floor. Rita, a 17-year-old girl with a vivid long face and period-appropriate curls, has just collapsed abruptly, as if struck by an unseen force. She wears a simple, modest dress typical of the decade. Her body is sprawled on the cold marble, with her back leg stiff as a pole, illustrating chronic suffering. The room's subtle shadows and understated decor enhance the atmosphere of personal tragedy and resilience.
