Set in a small, sparsely decorated house interior reflecting 1920s simplicity and familial hardship. The scene portrays Mrs. Costa, wearing simple clothes, sitting at the center with tear-streaked cheeks and a worried countenance. Her daughter, Rita, with a youthful long face and wearing a simple dress, enters the room visibly alarmed. Rita approaches her mother with concern and shock on her face, asking, 'Mother, what happened?' Overhead, the lighting casts long shadows, heightening the emotional weight. Mrs. Costa, with a round, deeply sorrowed face, responds with, 'We lost Marie. Marie died.' Her eyes reflect deep grief and acceptance. The overall ambiance is one of profound loss and maternal sorrow.
