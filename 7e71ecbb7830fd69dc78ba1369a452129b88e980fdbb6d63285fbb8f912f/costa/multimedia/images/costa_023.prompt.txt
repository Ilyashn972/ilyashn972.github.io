A 1920s traditional kitchen with a large wooden dining table at the center illuminated by sunlight streaming through a curtained window. Narrator's elderly mother, gentle-faced, sits at the table head, hands clasped tightly. Sister 1, a woman in her 50s in a blouse and skirt, stands supportively beside her. Sister 2, seated next to the mother, is also in her 50s, looking with disbelief. Sister 3 stands near the kitchen counter for support, her face mirroring shared shock, also in her 50s. The room is bright yet subdued, filled with emotional intensity from unexpected news.
