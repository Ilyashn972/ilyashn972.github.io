In a warm home setting typical of a mid-20th century atmosphere, two sisters are seated in a cozy living room, expectantly waiting with a sense of anticipation and concern. The room is softly lit by afternoon sunlight filtering through lace curtains. One sister holds a remarkably large orange, a gift meant for Marie, representing both hope and care. The other sister looks toward the phone, poised for the call that will signal Marie's homecoming. The decor is simple yet homely, with elements like patterned wallpaper and wooden furniture reflecting the time. The scene conveys a mix of warmth, expectation, and underlying tension as the sisters await news.
