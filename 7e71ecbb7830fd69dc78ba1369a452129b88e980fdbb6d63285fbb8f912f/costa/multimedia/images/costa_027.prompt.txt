A small 1920s general store during a clear spring day, filled with goods like jars and packages with an old-style cash register. Annie, a 50-year-old woman with a kind appearance and wearing a store uniform, stands behind the counter, having just hung up an old-fashioned telephone receiver. The focus is on her urgent expression as she conveys news about Marie's hospital discharge to Mrs. Costa, capturing the sense of community support and quiet urgency.
