In 1920, on Wolf Street, we view Mrs. Costa from behind as she heads toward the Methodist Hospital. It's early afternoon, and she's a 50-year-old woman in simple, modest attire of the early 20th century, carrying a coat and her daughter's dress over her arm, walking with determination. The street is lined with blooming flowers and features symmetrical, brownstone houses, capturing a vintage architectural style. The atmosphere is anxious yet hopeful, with the sun at its peak casting distinct shadows, symbolizing a journey's weight.
