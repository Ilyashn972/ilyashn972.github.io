A 1920 hospital room during a spring morning, illuminated by natural light through tall windows. Nurse in a traditional white uniform, with a round face, stands next to Maria's bed, who lies under ether. Victoria, a 21-year-old with an elegant long face and simple clothing, is entering the room, noticing the chair placed next to Maria's bed. The room captures early 20th-century medical care, focusing on Victoria's concerned entrance and the nurse's professional stance.
