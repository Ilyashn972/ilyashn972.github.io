A 1920s living room with sepia-toned lighting casting shadows on the wooden floor. The room features vintage furniture including a floral-patterned armchair and an ornate wooden side table with family photos in silver frames. Mrs. Costa, a worried 50-year-old woman, dressed in simple 1920s attire, stands to the left with a handkerchief in hand. Mike, a 50-year-old man in elegant, working-class clothes, sits center-right on the armchair with a clean-shaven round face. The ambiance is sentimental and nostalgic with muted tones, evocative of early 20th-century cinema style.
