A concerned family scene at a hospital in the year 1920. Rita, a 17-year-old girl with a simple appearance and long face, speaks with worried body language. She stands next to a car in a hospital parking lot, accompanied by her brother-in-law, a man in regular clothing with a worried expression, paced near an old-fashioned car. The environment should reflect the style of that era with vintage cars and hospital architecture. Use muted tones and cinematic lighting indicative of the 1950s realism style.
