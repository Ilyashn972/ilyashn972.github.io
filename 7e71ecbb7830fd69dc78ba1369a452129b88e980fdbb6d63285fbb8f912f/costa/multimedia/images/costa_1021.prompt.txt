A 1920s residential street in the morning with freshly cleaned pavement. Young James, around 8, wearing 1920s short trousers and suspenders, stands with tear-streaked cheeks and red eyes. He is slightly to the right, looking up at two women. Aunt Millie, in a modest dress typical of the era, stands centrally on the left, surprised. Aunt Jenny, in a practical skirt and blouse, bends slightly toward James, reaching out a reassuring hand. The scene is bathed in warm morning sunlight, enhancing the emotional moment.
