Scene set in a 1920s hospital office. We do not see Mrs. Costa's face, but we catch a glimpse of her quietly praying. Her posture conveys deep concern. In the background, a small nurse is taking blankets from a closet, highlighting daily healthcare tasks. The setting features subdued lighting, with vintage furniture and a large window casting soft light, creating a tranquil and earnest atmosphere.
