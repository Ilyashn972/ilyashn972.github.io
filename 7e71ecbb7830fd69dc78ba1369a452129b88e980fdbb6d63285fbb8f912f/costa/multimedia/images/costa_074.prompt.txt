In a 1920s hospital setting, Mrs. Costa is overwhelmed with grief and anger, facing away, accusing the medical staff after her daughter's death, yelling hysterically at Dr. Montique, a lady doctor, with her demanding posture. Dr. Montique, as a composed female doctor, remains calm, trying to handle the situation. The room is starkly furnished, typical of the 1920s, emphasizing the clinical environment amidst Mrs. Costa's unseen face and accusatory stance contrasting with the medical staff's composed effort.
