She said to the nurse, ""What's this chair doing here?"" The nurse said ""We need to get her out of bed."" but she was still under ether. Back then they used a lot of ether. So she said to the nurse, ""She can't get out of bed, she's still under ether. She's still sick.""

See, the nurses knew me, I had three operations there in no time, less than a year. They just kept coming, and I was yelling, ""You killed her! You killed her!""

You killed my daughter, and now you're trying to kill me?"" I started screaming, I was hysterical, banging my head against the wall and everything, I had hair pulled out, I was a mess. My husband had got home, gone upstairs to shave and shower, then sat on the steps waiting for Marie to come home. The hospital called the girl at the store again, and said, ""Where's the mother? Tell the mother to come to the hospital."" The girl said, ""That's strange, the mother already went to the hospital, she should be there."" Then they went up from the office. Then just as I turned my back, my daughter had passed away. I was screaming, crying, just a mess, and the lady doctor - they were all trying to get me to calm down. But she was only eighteen. I went home and told everybody what happened. My brother-in-law, he's an undertaker. I called my sisters. I sent my youngest son, James, to tell his Aunties what happened. They thought Marie would be coming home that day. They were cleaning the pavement, and doing the cement work, and cleaning the pavement.
