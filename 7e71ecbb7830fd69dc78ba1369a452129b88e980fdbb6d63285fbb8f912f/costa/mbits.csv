She had been transferred from a bed to a chair which could have caused it (?). I believe I read something about her husband and son having a heart attack as well (?). Which was confusing because then the son told her sisters that were waiting back at home that Marie had passed. The dad/husband was also at home excitingly waiting for Marie. The mom had told the dad to prep coffee for Marie for when she's back and they had also prepped something else that I cannot recall. If I recall correctly the surgery happened due to appendicitis. The mom was also screaming in the hospital at the doctors and nurses that they had killed her daughter. They used lots of ether.

When the mother gets to the hospital, the nurses ask her if Marie has ever had fainting spells. They then rush to get the doctors as Marie has taken a bad turn, and died. Marie's mother is hysterical and crying blaming the hospital for her death. When she gets home and tells her husband, he has a heart attack. She sends her young son in law to go and tell her sisters the news. Everyone is so upset and says how nice of a girl Marie was and how sorry they are to hear that she has passed.",11.67,12.61,2.28,0.4,6.16,-0.41,-1.11,4.93,-0.66,0.57,2.71,-1.61,0.87,1.52,-1.02,-3.04,1.05,0.76,-3.07,-0.22,0.7,9.84,-2.76,5.45,-1.39,5.29,-1.22,9.56,1.08,-2.49,1.73,-0.5,0.82,-0.35,10.13,0.62,-1.47,0.07,1.36,0.32,0.83,0.7,0.37,-2.4,0.85,-0.56,-0.66,-0.67,-0.32,-3.47,0.76,-2.51,1.63,-1.53,0.04,0.89,-1.24,-0.41,-1.32,-0.48,-0.36,-0.18,-0.6,-2.82,0.17,1.66,11.06,-0.4,-2.69,-1.11,-1.31,-1.18,0.23,-0.45,1.44,0.06,1.58,4.76,0.14,-3.39,-0.45,-0.02,0.06,-1.0,-0.35,-0.68,-0.84,0.85,-0.34,0.32,-0.52,0.26,-0.23,-0.52,0.02,-4.36,-0.28,0.47,0.2,-0.46,-1.19,-0.88,-3.46,-0.47,-0.4,0.64,-0.11,-2.37,-1.05,-0.75,-1.98,-0.35,-0.05,-0.61,-0.67,0.73,-1.32,-1.43,0.13,1.12,0.29,1.06,-0.65,-0.23,0.75,-3.63,0.61,0.36,-0.22,-0.45,-0.89,0.33,2.26,-0.87,-0.52,-1.97,0.39,-0.76,1.12,0.0,-1.74,1.34,-1.62,0.95,-2.11,-0.63,-0.88,0.27,-0.39,0.01,0.35,0.05,1.88,-0.58,0.2,-0.29,0.16,1.4,-1.07,0.98,-0.29,1.03,5.07,0.81,-2.93,-2.26,0.37,2.43,-0.99,-0.31,-0.88,-0.22,3.11,1.05,-1.26,-1.61,1.81,0.48,-0.71,-0.39,-1.46,0.84,1.09,-0.61,-0.92,0.01,-0.08,0.78,-0.84,-1.49,-0.49,0.55,-0.29,-0.08

51,49.96,"Mrs Costa's daughter, Marie, was in the hospital getting treated for an illness. During the end of her stay, the day she was supposed to be discharged, the nurses had Marie try to walk around her hospital room. Mrs Costa believes that this caused a blood clot in her leg, which led to her death at the time of discharge. On the day of her discharge, the family was looking forward to her coming home. They received a call through a local store that she was ready to be discharged do they not have a phone? They got everything ready for Marie. They had coffee and breakfast prepared and Mrs Costa went by herself to pick Mary up. Her husband and other daughter stayed at their house to continue preparing. At this time, other family members were notified that Marie was being released on that day. Costa states that she had clothes and other things laid out and brought jackets and clothes to the hospital with her. At the hospital, Costa was told to sit and wait. She sat with another patient who'd had gallbladder surgery and prayed for her recovery because she had way too many children. While waiting, she saw some medical staff running to a patient. Costa quickly learned that they were running to treat a medical emergency for Marie, who had developed a clot in her leg. She was taken to Marie's room. Marie was visibly unwell, sweating heavily and with an unnaturally stiff leg Costa started to panic and become belligerent while the doctors rushed around trying to mitigate the situation. During that mess, Marie succumbed to the blood clot. Costa became understandably enraged and started shouting about how the hospital had killed her daughter and complained that they wanted to kill her as well when offerings some sort of calming injection. After some more time the husband and other daughter arrived at the hospital, as they'd become concerned about the lack of updates. They learned at that point that Marie had died. However, Costa's story has an inconsistency from how I recall it here because she then goes on to say that her husband was waiting on the porch and asked what was wrong when she arrived and only sat in the car screaming. They sent one of their other children or grandchildren to notify other relatives. He seems to have been a child and was crying by the time he arrived, leading them to ask what was wrong before he broke the news. Costa then rambles a bit more about unnecessary details but I don't remember them because they weren't key to the story.",10.29,1.08,6.59,3.38,0.08,-2.42,2.32,2.04,-0.38,0.65,2.14,-1.38,0.68,-0.05,-1.1,-3.6,0.82,0.58,-2.1,0.63,-1.09,6.98,-0.62,5.27,4.73,11.73,-1.6,8.95,1.07,1.5,-0.39,-0.73,1.42,0.98,4.38,-1.96,-0.86,-1.21,-0.16,-1.92,0.54,1.35,3.07,-1.89,0.53,-0.05,0.35,2.97,0.29,-3.29,0.19,-4.59,-2.9,-1.86,-0.26,0.78,3.35,24.34,2.91,-1.86,-0.48,0.04,-2.39,-0.94,0.57,-0.67,-6.31,4.35,-2.1,-0.32,0.46,0.07,-0.16,1.33,1.54,0.37,0.89,2.7,-0.15,-3.42,-0.08,0.17,-0.26,-0.65,0.11,-2.15,-0.21,1.12,-1.65,-0.68,-1.46,2.0,-0.11,0.47,-0.16,-0.02,0.51,-1.82,0.73,0.51,-1.22,-1.21,-2.01,-1.3,-0.89,1.27,-0.94,-1.53,0.72,-0.25,-1.22,1.53,0.26,-0.27,2.08,0.55,-1.37,-0.36,-0.62,1.53,0.17,0.66,-0.39,-0.8,0.04,-2.43,-0.18,0.27,-0.42,-1.99,-1.4,0.05,0.81,-0.85,-0.17,-1.53,0.42,-1.86,0.89,0.61,-1.07,-0.87,1.49,1.96,-1.74,0.78,-0.93,0.45,-0.05,0.32,-0.98,-0.38,0.1,1.87,0.18,-0.21,-0.56,0.12,1.95,0.77,0.4,-1.64,-1.71,0.57,-0.82,-1.99,-0.53,-0.21,1.58,0.17,-4.2,-0.29,2.21,1.17,-0.58,-1.3,2.38,1.06,1.6,-1.58,-1.66,0.04,-0.35,-1.48,1.06,-0.83,0.15,0.13,-1.63,-0.66,-2.36,-0.68,-0.96,0.61

58,55.64,"28 years ago, Mrs. Costa's daughter Marie died at the age of 18. She had been hospitalized for appendicitis and received surgery while under ether for anesthesia. She suffered some initial post-surgical complications and was hospitalized for 10 days, during which time the nursing staff made her sit and walk around in ways her mother now believes may have contributed to her death. Marie suffered a blood clot as she was being released from the hospital, fainting and sweating profusely while her mother waited in the other room to help her get dressed for the trip home. Mrs. Costa had happily prepared for Marie's release, instructing other family members to take care of certain tasks ahead of Marie's arrival. While Marie was experiencing the emergency that led to her death, other family members were eagerly awaiting her. The hospital office staff was not aware Marie had just passed away and, during the crisis, was calling the family wondering why Marie hadn't completed her release to home yet. When Mrs. Costa became aware of Marie's emergency, she became agitated and terribly upset, accusing doctors and nurses of killing her daughter. Marie is still remembered by those who loved her; her mother honors Marie's memory each day as she drinks her first cup of coffee, and family friends reminisce about seeing Marie in their memories as though she were there in real life.",10.8,10.37,2.49,2.32,11.23,-2.82,-1.11,7.54,0.28,2.12,5.58,-1.97,0.21,0.72,-1.3,-4.39,1.05,-1.74,0.0,0.66,0.92,8.25,9.6,-2.17,-1.59,6.46,-0.79,8.39,-0.47,0.1,0.14,0.78,-1.45,-0.71,1.98,10.19,2.93,-0.69,-0.4,-0.44,-2.49,-0.21,-1.05,-3.24,1.16,-0.2,-0.46,0.48,1.14,-2.68,0.4,-1.25,-0.56,-0.85,-0.16,1.16,-1.51,0.59,-2.1,-0.28,-0.51,-0.61,0.89,-0.09,0.18,1.47,0.7,-0.81,-1.2,-0.18,0.35,1.51,0.79,1.97,1.84,-0.17,-0.63,0.8,0.32,-2.95,-0.29,0.48,0.71,-0.18,-0.66,-1.42,-1.64,0.23,-1.05,1.4,-1.16,0.99,0.96,-0.23,1.66,-3.79,0.19,4.54,12.72,-0.91,3.41,-0.82,-0.83,-1.03,0.47,0.89,-0.6,-1.17,-1.85,-1.18,-0.77,-0.29,-0.05,-0.43,-1.48,0.25,-0.64,-1.63,-0.55,0.28,-0.08,0.68,-1.18,-0.85,-0.49,-4.11,0.35,-0.02,-0.62,-3.69,-2.28,-0.18,0.96,-1.15,0.15,-1.36,0.47,-0.82,1.02,0.65,-0.7,1.86,-1.17,1.38,-1.09,0.77,-0.81,0.13,0.23,0.19,-0.98,-0.21,-0.15,-0.4,0.35,-0.34,-1.37,-3.04,-1.04,1.3,0.72,-0.68,-0.82,0.5,-0.13,-0.59,0.23,-0.93,1.29,0.44,-2.25,-0.03,1.1,0.01,-0.45,-1.86,2.65,1.3,-1.51,-1.18,-0.96,0.21,-0.03,-0.62,-0.16,-0.42,0.06,-0.18,-0.82,-0.85,1.34,-0.84,-0.82,0.4

After the surgery, her daughter was still under ether anesthesia. Despite this, a nurse followed the doctor’s orders to get her out of bed, though she was too weak. The woman believes this action led to her daughter developing a blood clot, which she holds the hospital staff responsible for. The woman recounts her reaction to her daughter's sudden decline after surgery, accusing the doctors of killing her. She recalls screaming at the doctors, particularly Dr. Montique, the assistant to Dr. Schwartz, who performed the operation. Despite being told to talk to her daughter, the woman was too distraught, as her daughter was dying. Overcome with hysteria, she describes her daughter, only 18 and ready to come home, passing away while she briefly turned away. Her husband was waiting for their daughter at home, unaware of the tragedy unfolding at the hospital.

She had been in hospital for 10 days and the nurses took her out of bed to ensure she wouldn't get clots. Marie had been excited to come home. I took her coat with me. While I was on my way my husband was shaving and getting ready to welcome her home, waiting on the step outside our house for her. When I got to the hospital there were doctors and nurses running, a nurse came up to me and asked if I was Marie's mother. I asked her if all the running was for my daughter and they said yes. They took me into her room and told me to talk to her, I said 'what am I meant to say, my daughter is dying.' She passed away soon afterwards from a blood clot. I was pulling my hair out and hitting my head on the wall outside the office. They drove me home and when I told my husband what had happened he had a heart attack.

When the nurse tried to get Marie out of bed, she passed out. She had to be put back in bed. The narrator blamed the hospital staff for a blood clot Marie developed from being moved too soon. After 10 days, the hospital called to say Marie was discharged. The narrator went to pick her up. She brought clothes and coffee for Marie. Marie had been wishing for it. However, when the narrator arrived, a nurse told her to sit down and wait. The narrator prayed for another patient. Then a nurse informed her that Marie was sweating heavily and appeared to be in distress. The narrator rushed into the room. She saw Marie sweating profusely. In a panic, she accused the doctors and nurses of killing her daughter. Soon after, Marie passed away while preparing to come home. The hospital staff had tried to contact the family.

After a while, Victoria noticed something was wrong and Marie was removed from her bed. She enquired from the nurse why this happened and she was told that the doctor ordered it. Victoria in rage told the nurse Marie was too weak and sick and She returned Marie back to her bed after Marie passed out. Mrs. Costa got a call in the middle of the night from the woman at the store because she didn't have a phone. She told Mrs. Costa to go get Marie at the hospital. Mrs. Costa set out to the hospital and instructed Rita to finish up the cooking because their daddy will be home soon. Mrs. Costa bought some dress-like coats for Marie and took it with her to the hospital. On getting to the hospital, the nurse sat her down and questioned her if Marie has had a fainting spell and Mrs. Costa felt uneasy and answered yes and she was invited to her daughter's room and saw her daughter lying on the bed lifeless. Mrs. Costa was filled with emotions and crying and wailing and then the doctor who carried out the operation came in and immediately, Mrs. Costa asked her what she did to her daughter but the doctor replied by saying she doesn't know what happened. Afterwards, the nurse advised her to talk to her daughter but Mrs. Costa was confused and she was in agony. Mrs. Costa husband was now home and expecting his wife to return with his daughter, he was calling the store to enquire what must have happened thinking that Marie was already discharged. So Rita went to the hospital herself and she was surprised at what she saw. Her mother broke the news that her sister, Marie has died and on hearing it, Rita could not control herself. She fell on the hard floor in shock and in grief and she had a problem that developed due to this fall. When Marie's body wanted to be moved, Mrs. Costa didn't allow it because she was in grief.

But the nurse told her that it was the Doctor's orders. She pulled Marie out of bed but she collapsed. The mother did not have a phone so the hospital called the lady at the store to tell Mrs. Costa that she needs to pick up Marie because she is discharged. That morning she asked her daughter to put on some coffee for Marie because she likes coffee in the morning. She laid out Marie's clothes and put her coat on her arm and headed to the hospital. Marie was up and busy saying goodbye to the girls at the hospital when her mother got there. Then the nurse came and asked Mrs. Costa if her daughter had had fainting spells before, she asked if she was going to her daughter, when she saw her daughter she realized that she was sweating. It was a lot of sweat. She was still in her house slippers. Marie died and Mrs. Costa started screaming at the nurse that they had killed her daughter. The female Dr., Dr. Schwartz, had assisted the doctor who did the surgery. She came into the room and Mrs. Costa shouted at her too. The hospital kept calling asking for the mother to come pick up Marie. Marie's sister figured something was wrong and also headed to the hospital. She found her mother in the office undone and that's when she found out about Marie's. She fell and broke her leg. They eventually figured that a blot clot was what had killed Marie.

During recovery, she was made to get up from the bed and sit in a chair where she fainted that caused a blood clot that led to her death 28 years ago on the 30th of April when she was only 18 years old. Mary did not have a phone at home so the woman from the store received the call when it was time to retrieve Marie from the hospital. But she died shortly after she arrived after saying goodbye to Arlene and other women at the hospital. Mary became very distraught, screaming and pulling at her hair and threatening to kick and kill people and burn the hospital to the ground with everyone in it. They tried to give her a shot and she wondered if they wanted to kill her, too, after killing her daughter. Mary had three surgeries over a short period of time at the hospital so all of the nurses knew her. She was taken home by hospital staff and screamed the entire way. People came out of their houses to see what the matter was.

I asked the nurse ""Why is there a chair there?"" She replied ""So you have a place to sit."" A couple weeks later. I got a call from the doctor. Saying that Marie was ready to be discharged. I was cooking at the time. I told someone to finish cooking. While I go pick up Marie. ""Go to the bakery and get a cake for Marie."" I told my husband. After getting ready. I placed my coat & Marie's clothes over 1 arm. & headed out to go pick her up. Once I arrived at the hospital. I was told to wait in the lobby. While the nurses go get Marie ready. At the time. There was a mother of 10 children. That was my neighbor. Getting surgery for a gallbladder stone. I prayed to God that she made it through. ""Dear lord, please do not take this mother away from her children."" The nurse came back then. Picked up the phone. She came to me. And asked ""Has your daughter ever had tendencies to faint?"" She told me. That as Marie was getting ready to leave. She said ""Oh my leg hurts, and I can't see."" Before she fainted. And had a cold sweat. She was sweating beads of sweat. They were that big I tell you. ""What did you do?! You killed my daughter!"" I yelled at the nurse. A doctor rushed in. ""We don't know what happened."" I was banging my head against the wall. Hair pulled out. & hysterical. My other daughter & husband were wondering what was taking so long to bring home Marie. So my other daughter went to the hospital as well. She heard me screaming. And asked what was going on. ""They killed Marie!"" I told her. She dropped to her knees. Staring blankly at the floor. Marie's leg was hard as a pole. From the blood clot she had. Still hysterical. They brought me to an office. To remove me from the hospital. I was still screaming. Hair pulled out. Hysterical. When I got home. My husband was sitting in front of the house. & asked what happened. ""We lost Marie, Marie is dead."" I told him. Hearing the news. He had a heart attack. I called everyone. To tell them what had happened. I told my son James. To go tell my sister and mother. About what happened. ""Why are you crying little James?"" Asked my sister. ""Auntie, Granny... Marie died.""

15,201.3,"A woman recounts the passing of her daughter, Marie. She talks about how it happened 28 years ago. It happened on April the 20th. Marie was in hospital. She was having an operation to treat appendicitis. A nurse tried to move her out of a bed into a chair. However, she was heavily sedated on Ether. She passed out whilst they were attempting to move her. They were forced to put her back into bed. The narrator believes this may have been the cause of the blood clot. The blood clot resulted in her death. The narrator recounts the day in which she was supposed to pick up Marie from the hospital. She gathered several of her clothes. She gathered a coat. She speaks about how they lacked a telephone. The local store had agreed to call ahead. The store was to let the rest of the family know when Marie had been discharged. She arrived at the hospital. She sat in a chair. She prayed for an elderly woman. The elderly woman was also undergoing an operation. She noticed several nurses grabbing cold towels. She inquired as to where her daughter was. She was then asked whether her daughter had a history of fainting. Worry began to set in. ""What have you done to my daughter?"", she asked. She was told to come with the nurse. The mother states that the beads of sweat appearing on her daughter's face were very large. Seeing this made the narrator lose herself with anguish. She shouted at the nurses. She shouted at the doctors. She said that they had 'killed her daughter'. Shortly after, as she turned her back, Marie died. The narrator had torn her own hair out. She was still shouting. She was moved to a waiting area. She had refused 'a shot' from a doctor. She believed they were going to kill her too. A short time later, another daughter arrived at the hospital. The other daughter wanted to see what had held them up. The other daughter believed that they should have been home by now. When the narrator told her that Marie had died. She collapsed to the floor 'like lightning'. Later, the mother describes how she returned home. She was screaming from the grief. This caused many people to investigate what happened. She states that when she told her husband and her son. They both had heart attacks. Later, she recounts visiting a store. The employee would always remind her of how Marie would use to stand on the step outside. Marie was a quiet girl. Marie was always kind and good.",13.27,10.39,6.89,1.47,12.58,-4.9,1.44,6.16,-0.66,5.16,6.6,-6.15,-0.02,2.62,-0.62,-2.47,0.81,2.36,2.96,4.59,0.96,9.76,-5.96,4.26,5.6,0.79,-1.66,8.72,0.78,2.1,-2.89,-0.03,1.66,-0.32,0.08,-2.78,-1.36,-0.73,0.92,1.59,0.04,3.41,4.04,-0.3,1.71,-1.0,0.06,2.62,0.26,-3.59,-0.02,-2.62,0.88,-0.74,-0.11,0.91,0.7,24.41,-2.63,0.52,0.04,0.06,-3.76,0.81,0.04,1.65,7.28,0.57,-1.97,-1.18,0.06,8.98,0.05,3.06,2.44,0.16,-0.64,1.64,-0.47,-3.93,-0.27,0.71,0.85,-1.27,1.23,-2.03,-1.7,1.45,7.8,-1.58,-0.83,9.92,-1.2,-0.54,-2.05,-1.27,-0.12,1.49,0.0,-0.22,-0.44,-0.48,-3.08,0.89,-0.08,0.97,-0.31,-0.69,1.13,-1.13,-1.13,4.9,0.68,1.06,2.82,0.21,-2.2,-1.7,-0.12,1.88,0.78,0.69,-0.84,-0.37,-1.29,0.47,-0.59,1.06,2.08,15.2,1.73,0.91,0.85,-1.3,0.66,-2.97,0.2,-1.02,0.77,0.51,-1.82,0.97,-0.76,1.08,-1.72,-0.31,-1.65,0.47,-0.29,-0.28,-0.55,0.13,2.88,3.67,-0.61,0.37,4.91,-0.62,0.52,1.16,1.01,-0.58,5.34,0.53,4.84,-0.73,2.82,-0.94,0.46,-0.34,0.23,0.04,1.58,-0.03,-0.84,-2.59,2.52,0.52,-1.54,-1.41,-0.57,0.59,0.34,-0.64,-1.03,-0.2,0.02,-0.41,-0.94,-1.65,22.07,4.82,1.82,0.15
11,229.63,"It is 28 years since the death of Mrs. Costa's daughter, Marie, who died on the 30th of April - 10 days after an operation for appendicitis. Mrs. Costa's other daughter Veronica had gone to the Methodist Hospital to see how Marie was. They were getting her out of bed. The surgeon was Dr. Schwarz, and his assistant was a female doctor, Dr. Montique. It was time for Marie to come home, and so Mrs. Costa had gone to the hospital, carrying her coat and after her husband had made a coffee. While there, waiting for Marie, she said a prayer for a woman she knew, praying that she would survive and that her daughter wouldn't be left without a mother. At that time, there was a commotion as something had happened to Marie. Mrs. Costa went into her room to see her daughter lying there, covered in beads of sweat. ""You've killed her,"" Mrs. Costa yelled. ""Don't you touch her, or I'll burn this whole hospital down and everyone in it. I know you want to find out why she died, but don't touch her."" It turned out that Mrs. Costa's other daughter Rita had been with her, and Marie had complained that she had a pain in her leg and couldn't see before collapsing. It turned out she had died from a blood clot. When Rita learned that Marie had died she collapsed to the floor, badly injuring her leg which became rigid. 28 years later and she still suffers extended periods of serious pain in that leg, like phlebitis. Mrs. Costa went home and informed her husband. He had shaved, and had been sitting on the porch immediately suffered a heart attack. When her son Michael found out, he also had a heart attack.

0,229.75,"My daughter died, twenty-eight years ago. I remember when she was at the hospital, they were moving everyone out of their beds. They tried to move her. I told them not to move her from her bed because she was under ether. I told them that Marie was under ether and not to move her. They tried to move her anyway, and when they did, she collapsed. She probably got a blood clot from it because they were talking about what could've caused it. I still remember that day, I was at home and they called me to say that Marie was being discharged from the hospital. I had all the clothes laid out on the table. My husband was at work. I went there and I was praying for this woman who had a gall bladder operation. I was praying to God to not take away this mother from her daughters. I saw a nurse running and she came and asked me something. I asked her if she was running for my daughter, and she said yes, come in. I went in and saw my daughter sweating. The beads of sweat were huge. I started screaming ""You killed her, You killed my daughter!"" A lady doctor Ms. Montique who was an assistant to the doctor who performed the surgery came to speak to me. I screamed very loudly, they wanted to inject me with something. I told them ""You killed my daughter and now you want to kill me."" The receptionist kept calling my home to tell us to come and pick up Marie since she was discharged. My daughter told them that I had already left for the hospital. They all came quickly because they were worried about me. They took me back home. I started screaming when we reached home, I was still in the car. People were coming out of their homes to check what was going on. I kept screaming ""They killed her!"". My husband was sitting on the porch, and he asked me what was going on. I told him ""Marie is dead, they killed her."" I showed them pictures of my daughter, she was only eighteen. When her sister and my husband found out, they collapsed. I told my youngest son to go and tell my sisters Auntie Jenny and Auntie Millie what had happened. When he went to tell them what had happened, they thought he was coming to tell them that Marie had come back home but when they found out, they were shocked. My sister brought an orange earlier, a big orange, nothing like I had ever seen before.

Victoria asked the nurse about the chairs. Victoria said she was too ill to get out of bed. She was blamed for the blood cot for getting her out of bed. She came home after ten days and I was waiting for a call from the hospital. She was operated on in April on the twentieth. It was chilly and I had a coat on my arm and a bag. She saw from the window on Wolf Street. She said my mother was coming and was just saying bye to everyone. When I got to the hospital I was told to sit down and I prayed for another patient who had ten children and lived near my mother. Dr. Schwartz did the operation but his assistant was Dr. Monique who was a lady doctor. I had all her clothes ready for her to go home. My husband was waiting for me. He came home and washed and shaved and then waited for me. They called the store to find out when mother was coming home. A doctor wanted to give me a shot but I said no I'll kick you.

I was already praying for another woman I knew—someone from my sister's neighborhood. She had just had an operation. She had ten kids. I was pleading with God not to take her away from them. But as I sat there, things started to take a turn. I was getting chills. A nurse's aide even brought me a blanket. I was trying to shake off the feeling when the nurse said to me, “Has your daughter ever had a fainting spell?” And right then, my heart sank. I rushed to the room. I saw my daughter Marie lying there. Her slippers still on. Sweat just pouring off of her. I couldn't believe it—I just kept yelling, ""What did you do to her? You killed my daughter!"" The doctors were trying to explain. All I could hear was them telling me they didn’t know what had happened. My beautiful Marie... she was only 18. I was hysterical. I was pulling at my hair, screaming. She was supposed to come home that day. We had everything ready. My husband was waiting at home for her. Sitting on the step. Not knowing what was about to happen. When the hospital called the store, they asked, ""When is the mother coming to pick up Marie?"" But my family, who was with me, knew something wasn't right. They all rushed back to the hospital. Thinking maybe I had gotten sick myself because of my heart condition. But when they arrived. They saw me in the state I was in. They knew. I told them, ""We lost Marie. Marie died."" It was chaos. My daughter Rita collapsed on the floor. As if struck by lightning. She heard the news. She’s been suffering ever since. Dealing with pain that comes and goes. Doctors later said it was a blood clot that caused Marie’s death. The girl who was with her said the last thing Marie complained about was pain in her leg. Not being able to see. And then she collapsed. When I got home, the entire neighborhood could hear my screams. My husband was sitting there. Asking, ""What happened?"" I told him, ""We lost Marie."" He had a heart attack right there on the spot. That same night, my son Michael collapsed too. It was just devastation all around. Everyone had been waiting for Marie to come home that day. My youngest sister had even brought a giant orange for her as a little gift. But instead of celebrating her coming home, we were left to deal with this heartbreaking loss. It shocked everyone.

My eldest daughter Victoria went in to see her, and, at that time I didn't have a phone. But the girl at the store had a phone and the hospital called her to let me know to come pick Marie up, she had been discharged. Twenty-eight, no, thirtieth this month it'll be, yeah. She said to me, ""Mrs. Costa"", she said, ""The hospital called for you to pick up Marie."" So I got ready to go, I told my daughter Rita to keep cooking, and I said, ""Put a pot of coffee on, Daddy will be home soon."" He was working that day. I always put out coffee for Marie, the first coffee of the day was hers. But when my eldest daughter Victoria got there, she got to the bed Marie was at, and right next to it was a chair. She said to the nurse, ""What's this chair doing here?"" The nurse said ""We need to get her out of bed."" but she was still under ether. Back then they used a lot of ether. So she said to the nurse, ""She can't get out of bed, she's still under ether. She's still sick."" Then the nurse said, ""Well that's doctor's orders,"" so she goes to get Marie up, and she took a few steps then she collapsed on the floor. She was never - they asked, ""Does she have any fainting spells?"" and she was healthy. So they called the girl at the store, and she tells me to go to the hospital, and I go, with Marie's coat on my arm, and her undercoat, and her coat on my arm. I got there and the nurse's aide, she was a little thing, she said something to me. The nurse tells me to ""Just sit right here, sit down for a little while."" and I got chills. Then I see the nurse's aide go into a closet and get a blanket out, then she turns to the nurse and says, ""she's got cold sweat."" Then they started running, and I saw it, and I'm not exaggerating, there were huge beads of sweat, just running, just pouring down her face. I got closer to her and I started yelling at the nurses, ""What did you do to her? You killed her. You killed her!"" See, the nurses knew me, I had three operations there in no time, less than a year. They just kept coming, and I was yelling, ""You killed her! You killed her!"" The doctor rushes in, and - she was a lady doctor, Dr Schwartes. The doctor, a lady doctor, tried to give me a shot. And I said to them, ""Get away from me! You killed my daughter, and now you're trying to kill me?"" I started screaming, I was hysterical, banging my head against the wall and everything, I had hair pulled out, I was a mess. My husband had got home, gone upstairs to shave and shower, then sat on the steps waiting for Marie to come home. The hospital called the girl at the store again, and said, ""Where's the mother? Tell the mother to come to the hospital."" The girl said, ""That's strange, the mother already went to the hospital, she should be there."" Then they went up from the office. Then just as I turned my back, my daughter had passed away. I was screaming, crying, just a mess, and the lady doctor - they were all trying to get me to calm down. But she was only eighteen. I went home and told everybody what happened. My brother-in-law, he's an undertaker. I called my sisters. I sent my youngest son, James, to tell his Aunties what happened. They thought Marie would be coming home that day. They were cleaning the pavement, and doing the cement work, and cleaning the pavement. As soon as they saw little Jamie come up, they could see his eyes were all red, and they said to him, ""Jamie, honey, what's happened? Why are you crying?"" He said to them, ""Aunt Millie, Aunt, Marie's died. She died at hospital."" When my husband came down from the steps, I told him, and no kidding, he had a heart attack, yeah. A heart attack.

61,818.75,"My daughter died. She'd be twenty-eight years this month. The thirtieth of this month yeah. She died at Methodist Hospital. She had an operation for appendicitis. It was Saturday afternoon when they operated, very late. Sunday morning, my oldest daughter, Victoria, went to the hospital to see how she was. She was still under ether. Back then, they used a lot of ether. There was a chair there. They were just starting to get people out. So Victoria saw the chair and she said to the nurse, ""What's this chair doing here?"" The nurse said ""Well, we've got to get her out of bed"". She said, ""What are you talking about? She's still under ether."" ""She's too sick."" But the nurse said, well, that's the doctor's orders. So they went to get her out of bed and she passed out, and they had to put her back in bed. See, here she never - I don't know if they know or what, but I blame them for the blood clot she got, taking her out of bed.

The lady from the store who had a phone called me, ""Mrs. Costa,"" at a quarter to five at night. ""Mrs. Costa, they just called you from the hospital. Go pick Marie up. She's discharged."" I had all the clothes laid out on the table. And Rita was - I was going, I said ""Rita, Finish the cooking. Daddy will be home soon"". He was working down in the yard. I said, ""And put a big pot of coffee on"" because she had been wishing for coffee. And you know every morning, that first cup of coffee, I offered it to her. When I get up in the morning the first cup is hers. It came - just poured from her - I said, “What did you do, kill my daughter? You killed her! You killed her!” That's what I kept yelling. And the doctor rushed in, see, they were trying to get",19.86,20.78,26.4,16.57,16.04,22.64,35.84,15.47,15.79,19.8,16.4,7.22,10.93,14.35,11.4,17.2,13.83,11.25,7.72,7.15,47.74,37.43,41.62,19.7,13.05,61.84,13.89,22.51,5.99,18.63,23.54,12.17,19.3,18.26,46.93,42.5,21.75,-9.73,-6.18,-2.17,-4.3,1.46,0.44,-2.55,0.05,-0.25,0.31,-0.4,0.6,-0.58,0.25,-1.48,1.62,-2.69,0.33,1.29,-0.96,0.41,-2.12,-0.68,-1.75,-0.17,-0.58,0.23,-0.34,0.58,-0.5,-0.61,-1.48,-0.35,0.8,-2.32,22.81,21.89,10.3,13.51,10.34,20.32,-2.54,-1.11,1.02,0.32,-0.07,-0.98,-1.13,-2.02,-1.53,-0.49,-1.45,0.35,-1.91,-0.86,-0.07,0.65,-0.25,-3.49,0.45,1.85,-0.71,-1.21,1.21,0.27,-0.53,0.26,-0.29,0.55,0.7,-1.62,-0.09,-1.25,-0.09,-0.7,-0.2,-0.79,-1.19,-0.18,-0.73,-0.75,-0.34,-0.05,0.14,1.15,-0.31,-0.09,-0.09,-3.2,0.22,0.27,-0.21,-2.43,-0.38,0.6,0.54,-0.27,0.2,-4.23,-0.14,-0.56,0.56,-0.63,-0.48,2.01,-2.38,1.41,-1.68,-0.6,-0.33,-0.01,0.46,0.57,-0.88,-0.19,-0.08,-0.09,0.03,-0.48,-1.29,-2.83,0.44,2.05,0.64,-0.65,-0.23,0.99,-0.66,-0.39,0.63,-1.17,0.52,0.23,-1.24,0.37,0.4,0.32,-0.06,-1.54,2.58,1.39,-1.65,-1.38,-1.62,0.27,-0.28,-0.7,0.17,-0.88,0.17,-0.05,-0.36,-0.73,-0.66,-0.47,-0.32,0.47
