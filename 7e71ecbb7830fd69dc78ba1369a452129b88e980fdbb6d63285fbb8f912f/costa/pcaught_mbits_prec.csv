2,0.6236559139784946,0.4838709677419355,4.43,It’ll be twenty-eight years this month.
3,0.5483870967741935,0.15053763440860216,5.26,"The thirtieth of this month, yeah."
4,0.6129032258064516,0.5806451612903226,3.37,She died at Methodist Hospital.
5,0.7741935483870968,0.6881720430107527,7.01,She had an operation for appendicitis.
6,0.3010752688172043,0.07526881720430108,-1.78,"It was late Saturday afternoon when they operated, very late."
7,0.4731182795698925,0.26881720430107525,4.25,"Sunday morning, my oldest daughter, Victoria, went to the hospital to see how she was."
8,0.41935483870967744,0.23655913978494625,3.36,She was still under ether.
9,0.34408602150537637,0.11827956989247312,-0.03,"Back then, they used a lot of ether."
10,0.3225806451612903,0.20430107526881722,3.05,There was a chair there.
11,0.46236559139784944,0.06451612903225806,2.18,"They were just starting to get people out of bed, you know."
12,0.23655913978494625,0.08602150537634409,-0.46,"So, Victoria saw the chair,"
13,0.40860215053763443,0.12903225806451613,0.86,"and she said to the nurse, “What’s this chair doing here?”"
14,0.5698924731182796,0.17204301075268819,0.61,"The nurse said, “Well, we’ve got to get her out of bed.”"
15,0.2903225806451613,0.10752688172043011,-1.32,"She said, “What are you talking about? She’s still under ether.”"
16,0.3333333333333333,0.06451612903225806,-1.3,“She’s too sick.”
17,0.4731182795698925,0.10752688172043011,-0.73,"But the nurse said, “Well, that’s the doctor’s orders.”"
18,0.46236559139784944,0.12903225806451613,0.59,"So, they went to get her out of bed,"
19,0.6236559139784946,0.24731182795698925,0.45,"and she passed out,"
20,0.3225806451612903,0.11827956989247312,0.41,and they had to put her back in bed.
21,0.3118279569892473,0.0,-0.38,"See, here, she never – I don’t know if they knew or what,"
22,0.6774193548387096,0.3655913978494624,3.99,"but I blame them for the blood clot she got, taking her out of bed."
23,0.4946236559139785,0.08602150537634409,0.72,"So, when she was walking around to come home after ten days,"
24,0.6989247311827957,0.24731182795698925,2.58,I was waiting for the call from the hospital.
25,0.3548387096774194,0.16129032258064516,0.75,I didn’t have a phone then.
26,0.7634408602150538,0.12903225806451613,8.62,"The lady from the store who had a phone called me, “Mrs. Costa,” at aquarter to five at night."
27,0.6666666666666666,0.10752688172043011,-0.21,"“Mrs. Costa, they just called you from the hospital."
28,0.8279569892473119,0.11827956989247312,7.49,Go Pick Marie up.
29,0.3225806451612903,0.13978494623655913,0.19,She’s discharged.”
30,0.4731182795698925,0.053763440860215055,-0.31,I had all the clothes laid out on the table.
31,0.5053763440860215,0.11827956989247312,2.0,"And Rita was – I was cooking,"
32,0.46236559139784944,0.0967741935483871,0.41,"I said, “Rita, finish the cooking.”"
33,0.46236559139784944,0.06451612903225806,0.61,Daddy will be home soon.”
34,0.3978494623655914,0.08602150537634409,0.16,He was working down in the yard.
35,0.43010752688172044,0.17204301075268819,1.78,"I said, “And put a big pot of coffee on,” because she had been wishing for coffee."
36,0.3870967741935484,0.043010752688172046,-0.76,"And you know, every morning, that first cup of coffee, I offered it to her."
37,0.3548387096774194,0.053763440860215055,-0.6,"When I get up in the morning, the first cup is hers."
38,0.3333333333333333,0.0,-0.87,"Since she’s gone, I never forget that."
39,0.3763440860215054,0.021505376344086023,1.0,"So I said, “Put a pot of coffee on,"
40,0.3763440860215054,0.053763440860215055,0.57,and send for some cake from the bakery.”
41,0.5268817204301075,0.0,-0.6,I’m going to get Marie; they called me.”
42,0.26881720430107525,0.0,1.34,"“All right, mother, go ahead,” she said, “I’ll finish up.”"
43,0.4838709677419355,0.053763440860215055,1.58,"And I went myself. You know, I had the coat on my arm."
44,0.3548387096774194,0.021505376344086023,-1.83,She was operated on in March –
45,0.5376344086021505,0.0,1.55,"No, April! So that was the thirtieth."
46,0.4946236559139785,0.10752688172043011,-0.04,"She was operated – ten days before, so that would be the twentieth."
47,0.22580645161290322,0.053763440860215055,-0.37,"The twentieth of April, right? It was kind of chilly."
48,0.41935483870967744,0.010752688172043012,0.35,"Oh, and I had everything in a bag,"
49,0.46236559139784944,0.12903225806451613,0.48,and I had the coat on my arm and her dress hanging on my arm.
50,0.3978494623655914,0.10752688172043011,-0.92,"She saw me from the windows, from Wolf Street."
51,0.27956989247311825,0.0,0.48,"She said, “My mother’s just coming.”"
52,0.34408602150537637,0.03225806451612903,-1.8,"She was with the girls, saying goodbye to everyone – you know how it is."
53,0.25806451612903225,0.021505376344086023,1.32,"They told me on the phone, it would be ten dollars more for her board."
54,0.25806451612903225,0.021505376344086023,-1.29,And to make sure I brought her girdle to put on.
55,0.23655913978494625,0.0,0.13,"I said, “All right, I’ll be right over.”"
56,0.5268817204301075,0.0,0.98,And I went.
57,0.7096774193548387,0.16129032258064516,0.22,"But when I got there, the nurse said to me, “Sit down, Mrs. Costa, sit here for a while.”"
58,0.45161290322580644,0.23655913978494625,6.21,"So I sat down, and I was praying for another lady in the hospital that had an operation for her gall bladder."
59,0.3763440860215054,0.12903225806451613,-0.33,"She lived near my sister, and she had ten children."
60,0.3548387096774194,0.010752688172043012,-0.34,They had said she was in very bad shape.
61,0.3978494623655914,0.06451612903225806,-0.18,"I prayed, “Oh dear God, don’t take that mother away from her children.”"
62,0.23655913978494625,0.010752688172043012,-0.32,"I was praying for her, you know."
63,0.3225806451612903,0.021505376344086023,-0.44,Then a little nurse’s aide went to the closet and got some blankets.
64,0.3010752688172043,0.06451612903225806,0.47,"I started getting the chills,"
65,0.22580645161290322,0.0,0.01,"and I was thinking about it,"
66,0.34408602150537637,0.03225806451612903,1.01,"when the aide said to the nurse, “Oh, she’s going into a cold sweat now.”"
67,0.5591397849462365,0.13978494623655913,0.57,"The nurse hung up the phone and came to me. She said, “Mrs. Costa, has your daughter ever had a fainting spell?”"
68,0.5483870967741935,0.03225806451612903,-0.6,"“Oh my God!” I said, “Don’t tell me you’re running for my daughter!”"
69,0.4946236559139785,0.03225806451612903,-0.8,"“Yes,” she said, “come on in.”"
70,0.5483870967741935,0.03225806451612903,-0.19,"So, I went into the room."
71,0.5591397849462365,0.12903225806451613,1.66,And my daughter was on the bed with her bedroom slippers and her housecoat on.
72,0.5053763440860215,0.06451612903225806,-0.56,"And the beads of sweat – honest to God, not to exaggerate, they were that big."
73,0.3870967741935484,0.0,0.25,It came – just poured from her –
74,0.7741935483870968,0.24731182795698925,1.25,"I said, “What did you do, kill my daughter?"
75,0.6236559139784946,0.21505376344086022,1.45,You killed her! You killed her!”
76,0.5698924731182796,0.03225806451612903,0.1,That’s what I kept yelling.
77,0.41935483870967744,0.021505376344086023,-0.32,"And the doctor rushed in,"
78,0.34408602150537637,0.0,1.04,"see, they were trying to get the doctor, you know."
79,0.45161290322580644,0.021505376344086023,0.99,She was a lady doctor.
80,0.40860215053763443,0.08602150537634409,-0.46,"Dr. Schwartz actually did the operation, but she was his assistant, Dr. Montique."
81,0.41935483870967744,0.11827956989247312,-0.05,She was a lady doctor.
82,0.27956989247311825,0.0,0.67,"So, she came in and she said –"
83,0.7096774193548387,0.043010752688172046,0.46,"I said, “You killed my daughter – what did you do to her?”"
84,0.5376344086021505,0.08602150537634409,-0.56,"She said, “We don’t know what happened, Mrs. Costa.”"
85,0.3118279569892473,0.010752688172043012,-0.22,She took me away from the bed.
86,0.40860215053763443,0.03225806451612903,-0.73,"The nurse said to me, “Talk to her.”"
87,0.3870967741935484,0.021505376344086023,-1.24,"I said, “Talk to her? My daughter’s dying, what am I supposed to tell her?”"
88,0.6881720430107527,0.07526881720430108,0.47,And I was screaming.
89,0.5698924731182796,0.043010752688172046,0.8,My hair was all pulled out.
90,0.6774193548387096,0.10752688172043011,0.84,"I went hysterical, you know what I mean? She was only eighteen years old."
91,0.34408602150537637,0.021505376344086023,-1.2,"Beautiful girl, you can see from her picture."
92,0.6451612903225806,0.07526881720430108,0.38,"And just as I turned my back, my daughter passed away."
93,0.4946236559139785,0.010752688172043012,0.46,She was getting ready to go home.
94,0.40860215053763443,0.010752688172043012,-0.27,I had the clothes and everything ready.
95,0.5376344086021505,0.043010752688172046,0.74,My husband was waiting for her.
96,0.5376344086021505,0.07526881720430108,-0.4,"He came home, went upstairs to shave and wash, then sat on the step, waiting."
97,0.4838709677419355,0.0,0.25,“When is the mother coming?”
98,0.46236559139784944,0.03225806451612903,1.27,The hospital kept calling.
99,0.4946236559139785,0.010752688172043012,0.54,The people in the office didn’t know what had happened yet.
100,0.5053763440860215,0.0,-0.97,"They kept calling the store, trying to reach us."
101,0.5376344086021505,0.03225806451612903,0.07,"They asked, “When is the mother coming to pick up Marie?"
102,0.5053763440860215,0.021505376344086023,-0.39,She’s discharged.”
103,0.5376344086021505,0.053763440860215055,-1.99,"And Rita said “That’s strange, the mother went to the hospital. She should be there.”"
104,0.46236559139784944,0.010752688172043012,-0.35,So they came back to the hospital to look for us.
105,0.44086021505376344,0.0,-0.24,"Rita said, “Gee, that’s strange,”"
106,0.43010752688172044,0.0,0.84,"she said, “Mother must’ve gotten really worked up about Marie.”"
107,0.3870967741935484,0.010752688172043012,-0.04,"You know, I’ve always had a bad heart."
108,0.41935483870967744,0.0,-1.03,"“Mother must’ve gotten so upset about Marie, she probably made herself sick,” Rita thought."
109,0.45161290322580644,0.03225806451612903,-0.64,"So she came over with my son-in-law, in the car."
110,0.4731182795698925,0.0,-0.94,"And I was in the main hallway, at the office."
111,0.45161290322580644,0.0,-1.12,I was all pulled apart.
112,0.5268817204301075,0.021505376344086023,-0.01,One doctor wanted to give me a shot.
113,0.4946236559139785,0.010752688172043012,-0.09,"I said, “Get out of here,"
114,0.5268817204301075,0.010752688172043012,-0.08,"I’ll kick you,” I said."
115,0.5698924731182796,0.08602150537634409,-0.39,"“You killed my daughter, now you want to kill me?”"
116,0.46236559139784944,0.010752688172043012,0.51,Another nurse came over.
117,0.45161290322580644,0.03225806451612903,-0.5,"See, they all knew me."
118,0.44086021505376344,0.06451612903225806,0.81,"I had three operations in no time, not even a year."
119,0.41935483870967744,0.043010752688172046,-0.06,And I knew all the nurses.
120,0.5053763440860215,0.0,0.74,"“Mrs. Costa, please, take –”"
121,0.5161290322580645,0.021505376344086023,0.25,"“Get out!” I said, “Don’t you dare come near me.”"
122,0.5698924731182796,0.021505376344086023,0.78,I was so hysterical.
123,0.6236559139784946,0.010752688172043012,-0.34,I was banging my head against the wall and everything.
124,0.4838709677419355,0.0,-0.45,They had to grab me.
125,0.40860215053763443,0.0,-0.06,"Then they brought me to the office, see."
126,0.4946236559139785,0.021505376344086023,-3.17,"When Rita came in and saw me like that, she asked, “Mother, what happened?”"
127,0.5161290322580645,0.053763440860215055,0.34,"I said, “We lost Marie."
128,0.5591397849462365,0.16129032258064516,0.29,Marie died.”
129,0.34408602150537637,0.0,0.22,"Well, that’s this one. This is a picture of Rita."
130,0.5053763440860215,0.07526881720430108,0.18,She went down like lightning.
131,0.46236559139784944,0.053763440860215055,-1.05,"Dropped to the floor, and that’s a marble floor."
132,0.41935483870967744,0.010752688172043012,0.15,She went down like lightning.
133,0.44086021505376344,0.010752688172043012,2.17,"And the back of her leg, it felt just like a pole."
134,0.41935483870967744,0.010752688172043012,-0.69,"Hard like a pole, the back of her leg."
