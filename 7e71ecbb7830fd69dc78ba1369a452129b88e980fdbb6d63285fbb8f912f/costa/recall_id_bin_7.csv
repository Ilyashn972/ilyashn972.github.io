I remember when she was at the hospital, they were moving everyone out of their beds. They tried to move her. I told them not to move her from her bed because she was under ether. I told them that Marie was under ether and not to move her. They tried to move her anyway, and when they did, she collapsed. She probably got a blood clot from it because they were talking about what could've caused it. I still remember that day, I was at home and they called me to say that Marie was being discharged from the hospital. I had all the clothes laid out on the table. My husband was at work. I went there and I was praying for this woman who had a gall bladder operation. I was praying to God to not take away this mother from her daughters. I saw a nurse running and she came and asked me something. I asked her if she was running for my daughter, and she said yes, come in. I went in and saw my daughter sweating. The beads of sweat were huge. I started screaming ""You killed her, You killed my daughter!"" A lady doctor Ms. Montique who was an assistant to the doctor who performed the surgery came to speak to me. I screamed very loudly, they wanted to inject me with something. I told them ""You killed my daughter and now you want to kill me."" The receptionist kept calling my home to tell us to come and pick up Marie since she was discharged. My daughter told them that I had already left for the hospital. They all came quickly because they were worried about me. They took me back home. I started screaming when we reached home, I was still in the car. People were coming out of their homes to check what was going on. I kept screaming ""They killed her!"". My husband was sitting on the porch, and he asked me what was going on. I told him ""Marie is dead, they killed her."" I showed them pictures of my daughter, she was only eighteen. When her sister and my husband found out, they collapsed. I told my youngest son to go and tell my sisters Auntie Jenny and Auntie Millie what had happened. When he went to tell them what had happened, they thought he was coming to tell them that Marie had come back home but when they found out, they were shocked. My sister brought an orange earlier, a big orange, nothing like I had ever seen before. The local store owner praised Marie a lot, she said that Marie would always come to the store and stand there, pointing at the steps. ""She would always stand there and look over"", She was a quiet girl, not much to talk. She was a good girl, Marie. - So that's what happened."

She had been transferred from a bed to a chair which could have caused it (?). I believe I read something about her husband and son having a heart attack as well (?). Which was confusing because then the son told her sisters that were waiting back at home that Marie had passed. The dad/husband was also at home excitingly waiting for Marie. The mom had told the dad to prep coffee for Marie for when she's back and they had also prepped something else that I cannot recall. If I recall correctly the surgery happened due to appendicitis. The mom was also screaming in the hospital at the doctors and nurses that they had killed her daughter. They used lots of ether. They did not have a phone so they were informed by a grocery store phone (?).

The mother prepared to pick up the daughter by getting clothes and other items ready for when he picked her up. The mother then received a message that her daughter was ready to be picked up by the lady at the store with the phone. When the mother got to the hospital the nurses had her sit down for a bit while she waited. They then asked her if her daughter had a history of fainting and then was taken to the room her daughter was in. She seen her daughter in a poor state with beads of sweat dripping and suddenly came to the realization that something is seriously wrong and started yelling ""you killed my daughter"". The nurses and doctors did try to calm her down but she would not. The mother's other daughter arrived at the hospital soon and found out what was happening and collapsed to the floor and died at the hospital also.

I had just gotten a message telling me to come over, so I went. When I arrived, they asked me to sit down. I was already praying for another woman I knew—someone from my sister's neighborhood. She had just had an operation. She had ten kids. I was pleading with God not to take her away from them. But as I sat there, things started to take a turn. I was getting chills. A nurse's aide even brought me a blanket. I was trying to shake off the feeling when the nurse said to me, “Has your daughter ever had a fainting spell?” And right then, my heart sank. I rushed to the room. I saw my daughter Marie lying there. Her slippers still on. Sweat just pouring off of her. I couldn't believe it—I just kept yelling, ""What did you do to her? You killed my daughter!"" The doctors were trying to explain. All I could hear was them telling me they didn’t know what had happened. My beautiful Marie... she was only 18. I was hysterical. I was pulling at my hair, screaming. She was supposed to come home that day. We had everything ready. My husband was waiting at home for her. Sitting on the step. Not knowing what was about to happen. When the hospital called the store, they asked, ""When is the mother coming to pick up Marie?"" But my family, who was with me, knew something wasn't right. They all rushed back to the hospital. Thinking maybe I had gotten sick myself because of my heart condition. But when they arrived. They saw me in the state I was in. They knew. I told them, ""We lost Marie. Marie died."" It was chaos. My daughter Rita collapsed on the floor. As if struck by lightning. She heard the news. She’s been suffering ever since. Dealing with pain that comes and goes. Doctors later said it was a blood clot that caused Marie’s death. The girl who was with her said the last thing Marie complained about was pain in her leg. Not being able to see. And then she collapsed. When I got home, the entire neighborhood could hear my screams. My husband was sitting there. Asking, ""What happened?"" I told him, ""We lost Marie."" He had a heart attack right there on the spot. That same night, my son Michael collapsed too. It was just devastation all around. Everyone had been waiting for Marie to come home that day. My youngest sister had even brought a giant orange for her as a little gift. But instead of celebrating her coming home, we were left to deal with this heartbreaking loss. It shocked everyone. My family. The neighbors. Everyone who knew Marie. She was such a quiet, sweet girl. I remember it like it was yesterday."
