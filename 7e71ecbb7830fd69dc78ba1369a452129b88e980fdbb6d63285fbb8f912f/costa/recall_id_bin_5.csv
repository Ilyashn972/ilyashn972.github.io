She was waiting for the hospital to call her to let her know that her daughter Marie would be dispatched and when she got the call she got clothes ready for her and made her way to the hospital. When Mrs. Costa got to the hospital the nurse suddenly told her that her daughter was in bad shape and had a fainting spell and that she was with slippers and a robe and she collapsed and then she passed away. The mother was furious and yelling at the hospital staff that they killed her and was screaming for them not to touch her because they wanted to check the cause of death. Mrs. Costa was hysterical and yelling and telling the doctors that operated on Marie that she will kill them if they got any closer to her and when Mrs. Costa got home she told her husband Michael that Marie was dead and the husband had a heart attack and in the end there was something about an orange from the aunt and that is all I remember.
