      <td>On Sunday morning, my oldest daughter, Victoria, went to the hospital to see how Marie was. Victoria saw the chair, but the nurse said, “Well, that’s the doctor’s orders.” Then someone said, “Mrs. Costa, they just called you from the hospital. Go pick Marie up. She’s discharged. Daddy will be home soon.” When I get up in the morning, the first cup is hers. The twentieth of April, right? It was kind of chilly, and I had the coat on my arm and her dress hanging on my arm. She was with the girls, saying goodbye to everyone—you know how it is. I said, “All right, I’ll be right over.” So I sat down, and I was praying for another lady in the hospital who had an operation for her gall bladder. I was praying for her, you know. I started getting the chills. “You killed her! You killed her!” They were trying to get the doctor, you know. I said, “You killed my daughter—what did you do to her?” I said, “Talk to her? My daughter’s dying; what am I supposed to tell her?” I had the clothes and everything ready. “When is the mother coming?” They kept calling the store, trying to reach us. One doctor wanted to give me a shot. “I’ll kick you,” I said. And I knew all the nurses. When Rita came in and saw me like that, she asked, “Mother, what happened?” I said, “Marie died.” When she gets that pain, it’s like she has phlebitis from it. And how did they figure out how Marie died? “You want to find out what she died from.” But if you touch my daughter, I’ll kill you.” I wouldn’t let them touch her. He had a heart attack too, no kidding. But instead, I sent my son James; he was little then. They said, “James, what’s the matter, honey?” It was a shock to everybody. That was a shock—she was a real quiet girl, pleasant, didn’t talk much.</td>

      <td>It’ll be twenty-eight years this month. It was late Saturday afternoon when they operated—very late. She was still under ether. They were just starting to get people out of bed, you know. The nurse said, “Well, we’ve got to get her out of bed.” Another nurse said, “What are you talking about? She’s still under ether.” Still, they went to get her out of bed. So, when she was walking around to come home after ten days, I went to pick Marie up. Rita was—I was cooking, and I said, “Rita, finish the cooking.” He was working down in the yard. When I get up in the morning, the first cup is hers. I said, “And send for some cake from the bakery. I’m going to get Marie; they called me.” She was operated on in March—I had the coat on my arm and her dress hanging on my arm. She was with the girls, saying goodbye to everyone—you know how it is. They told me on the phone it would be ten dollars more for her board, and to make sure I brought her girdle to put on. So I sat down, and I was praying for another lady in the hospital who had an operation for her gall bladder. They had said she was in very bad shape. I was praying for her, you know. Then a little nurse’s aide went to the closet and got some blankets, and I was thinking about it. The nurse hung up the phone and came to me. She said, “Mrs. Costa, has your daughter ever had a fainting spell?” My daughter was on the bed with her bedroom slippers and her housecoat on. Suddenly, it just poured from her. I said, “What did you do, kill my daughter?” That’s what I kept yelling. The doctor rushed in—they were trying to get the doctor, you know. I said, “You killed my daughter—what did you do to her?” They took me away from the bed. I said, “Talk to her? My daughter’s dying, what am I supposed to tell her?” And I was screaming. My hair was all pulled out. I went hysterical, you know what I mean? She was only eighteen years old. And just as I turned my back, my daughter passed away. “When is the mother coming?” the hospital kept calling. The people in the office didn’t know what had happened yet. They kept calling the store, trying to reach us. And Rita said, “That’s strange, the mother went to the hospital. She should be there.” You know, I’ve always had a bad heart. “You killed my daughter, now you want to kill me?” Another nurse came over. “Mrs. Costa, please, take—” “Get out!” I said. “Don’t you dare come near me.” I was so hysterical. I was banging my head against the wall and everything. She went down like lightning. The back of her leg—it felt just like a pole. Hard like a pole, the back of her leg. And that girl is suffering. When she gets that pain, it’s like she has phlebitis from it. And how did they figure out how Marie died? I told the doctor that Marie was saying goodbye to Arlene. And all Marie said to that girl was, “Oh, I’ve got a pain in my leg and I can’t see.” You want to find out what she died from. I wouldn’t let them touch her. I couldn’t get out, you know—I couldn’t. My husband was sitting on the step. I said, “Mike, we lost Marie. Marie died.” It was just a shock. Right then, my Michael came, and my Michael collapsed. She said, “Mary, look, when they call you, when you pick Marie up, let us know, and we’ll come over.” I said, “All right.” I called my brother-in-law. He was an undertaker—my sister’s husband. He’s passed away now too. God rest his soul. But instead, I sent my son James; he was little then. But when he got there, the poor kid’s eyes were all red. They said, “James, what’s the matter, honey?” It was a shock to everybody. That was a shock that—the neighborhood—Annie at the store always says, “Mrs. Costa,” every time I go in there, she reminds me, “I just picture Marie standing at that step, looking over here.” She used to stand at that step. She was a real quiet girl, pleasant, didn’t talk much, but she was so good, I can’t even tell you.</td>

      <td>My daughter died—the thirtieth of this month, yes. She died at Methodist Hospital. It was late Saturday afternoon when they operated, very late. Sunday morning, my oldest daughter, Victoria, went to the hospital to see how she was. Back then, they used a lot of ether. There was a chair there. They were just starting to get people out of bed, you know, and she said to the nurse, “What’s this chair doing here?” So, they went to get her out of bed, but they had to put her back in bed. When she was finally walking around, ready to come home after ten days, I was waiting for the call from the hospital. I didn’t have a phone then. They would call and say, “Go pick Marie up. She’s discharged.” And Rita was—well, I was cooking, and I said, “Rita, finish the cooking. Daddy will be home soon.” He was working down in the yard. I said, “And put a big pot of coffee on,” because Marie had been wishing for coffee. You know, every morning, that first cup of coffee, I offered it to her. When I get up in the morning, the first cup is hers. Since she’s gone, I never forget that. I also said, “And send for some cake from the bakery.” “All right, Mother, go ahead,” she said. “I’ll finish up.” It was the twentieth of April, right? It was kind of chilly, and I had the coat and her dress hanging on my arm. She saw me from the windows, from Wolf Street. She said, “My mother’s just coming.” They told me on the phone it would be ten dollars more for her board, and to make sure I brought her girdle to put on. So I went. But when I got there, the nurse said to me, “Sit down, Mrs. Costa, sit here for a while.” So I sat down, and I was praying for another lady in the hospital who had an operation for her gall bladder. She lived near my sister and had ten children. They had said she was in very bad shape. I prayed, “Oh dear God, don’t take that mother away from her children.” I started getting the chills, and I was thinking about it. “Oh my God!” I said. “Don’t tell me you’re coming for my daughter!” So, I went into the room. And the beads of sweat—honest to God, not to exaggerate, they were that big. I said, “What did you do, kill my daughter? You killed her! You killed her!” She was a lady doctor. Dr. Schwartz actually did the operation, but she was his assistant, Dr. Montique. She said, “We don’t know what happened, Mrs. Costa.” She took me away from the bed, and I was screaming. My hair was all pulled out. I went hysterical, you know what I mean? She was only eighteen years old. Beautiful girl, you can see from her picture. And just as I turned my back, my daughter passed away. She was getting ready to go home. I had the clothes and everything ready. My husband was waiting for her. He came home, went upstairs to shave and wash, then sat on the step, waiting. “When is Mother coming?” The hospital kept calling. The people in the office didn’t know what had happened yet. They kept calling the store, trying to reach us. They asked, “When is the mother coming to pick up Marie?” And Rita said, “That’s strange, Mother went to the hospital. She should be there.” So they came back to the hospital to look for us. “Mother must’ve gotten so upset about Marie, she probably made herself sick,” Rita thought. So she came over with my son-in-law, in the car. I was in the main hallway, at the office. I was all pulled apart. I said, “Get out of here, I’ll kick you.” Another nurse came over. See, they all knew me. I had three operations in no time, not even a year. “Mrs. Costa, please, take—” “Get out!” I said. “Don’t you dare come near me.” When Rita came in and saw me like that, she asked, “Mother, what happened?” I said, “We lost Marie. Marie died.” She went down like lightning. And the back of her leg, it felt just like a pole—hard like a pole, the back of her leg. When she gets that pain, it’s like she has phlebitis from it. And how did they figure out how Marie died? All Marie said to that girl was, “Oh, I’ve got a pain in my leg and I can’t see.” I said, “Don’t you dare touch my daughter. I don’t care who’s in it.” I wouldn’t let them touch her. So when I got home—they took me home. I was screaming in the car. I couldn’t get out, you know, I couldn’t—I was screaming! My husband was sitting on the step. Well, my hair was all pulled, and my face—I was a mess. I didn’t know what I had done to myself. Then my son, Michael—yes, that night—he had a heart attack too, no kidding. It was all—my two sisters were here, waiting until about half-past four. They waited because they knew she was coming home that day, waiting for the call. My younger sister had brought an orange for Marie, and I had never seen an orange like it. It was a big orange, like that. I said, “All right.” So, I got home and called everybody, told them what happened. I called my brother-in-law. So they were waiting for my call, you know, and had done the cement work, and they were cleaning the pavement. They said, “Here comes little Jamie,” and now they said, “James, what’s the matter, honey? Why are you crying?” “Aunt Jenny, Aunt Millie, Marie died,” he said. It was a shock to everybody. That was a shock—the neighborhood—Annie at the store always says, “Mrs. Costa,” every time I go in there, she reminds me, “I just picture Marie standing at that step, looking over here.” She used to stand at that step. She was a real quiet girl, pleasant, didn’t talk much.</td>
