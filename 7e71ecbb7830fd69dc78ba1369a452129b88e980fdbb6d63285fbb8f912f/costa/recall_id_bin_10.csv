Marie got a blood clot, and passed away because of that. The family was waiting to bring her home, and Mrs. Costa went to the hospital, getting Marie's clothes all lined up. Meanwhile, the father shaved and got ready for her return. At the hospital, a nurse's aide came to Mrs. Costa and explained that Marie had collapsed, and that they weren't sure exactly what happened. When Mrs. Costa got upset, they offered her a shot and she refused, saying they had killed her daughter and were trying to kill her, and she would trust the female Dr. Schwartz. The rest of the family had to be informed as well, and they sent a small male to tell her sisters and mother, and they all thought the boy was coming to tell them the good news, that Marie had returned safely, when it was actually bad news. This all happened around April 20th or so. Now, even when Mrs Costa goes to the store, the cashier there mentions how she used to see Marie sitting out on the step looking at the store."

Marie suffered a blood clot as she was being released from the hospital, fainting and sweating profusely while her mother waited in the other room to help her get dressed for the trip home. Mrs. Costa had happily prepared for Marie's release, instructing other family members to take care of certain tasks ahead of Marie's arrival. While Marie was experiencing the emergency that led to her death, other family members were eagerly awaiting her. The hospital office staff was not aware Marie had just passed away and, during the crisis, was calling the family wondering why Marie hadn't completed her release to home yet. When Mrs. Costa became aware of Marie's emergency, she became agitated and terribly upset, accusing doctors and nurses of killing her daughter. Marie is still remembered by those who loved her; her mother honors Marie's memory each day as she drinks her first cup of coffee, and family friends reminisce about seeing Marie in their memories as though she were there in real life."
