      <td>Marie, who was 18, was in the hospital for an appendicitis operation on April 20th. The mother Mary and the daughter Victoria went to the hospital to see how she was doing on April 30th but she wasn't ready to be discharged yet. The operation was done by Dr. Shaw, but she was just an assistant and the main lady doctor was Dr. Monique. The hospital had called to let Mary know that Marie was ready to be discharged, but since she didn't have a phone, the hospital had called the store. The store lady had let Mary know that her daughter Marie was ready for discharge but when Marie got there, there was a big problem. Mary had died from a blood clot. The family was devastated. The father and son both suffered from a heart attack. The relatives were actually getting ready for her discharge and one of the aunts had bought an orange. The mother had decided to tell the youngest boy to tell his aunt and uncle about the incident instead of calling and as the boy had arrived, he started weeping.</td>

      <td>A woman, Mrs. Costa, takes her daughter Marie to the hospital for surgery on her appendix. It should be routine without any issues. Mrs. Costa goes home and waits for the hospital to call her to pick up her daughter. When they call and she goes into the hospital, she finds out her daughter died. The surgeon was a woman named Dr. Schwartz. The Dr. tells her she heard Marie tell a girl that her leg hurt. The Dr. says there was a blood clot and that's what caused Marie's death. When Mrs. Costa goes into the hospital room, her daughter Marie is dressed in her slippers and robe. Mrs. Costa gets very upset and starts yelling. The nurses try to take her to an office and give her a shot of something to calm her down but Mrs. Costa won't let them. She yells at them to Stay Away from Her! When Mrs. Costa goes home, her husband is waiting on the stairs. When she tells him Marie has died, he has a heart attack. Another man or boy comes out and when she tells him what happened, he has a heart attack as well. Mrs. Costa remembers that her sisters are waiting to hear about Marie as well, so she sends her son James to tell them what happened. One of the sisters' husbands is also an undertaker. When James arrives at their house, they're excited to see him but they quickly notice his eyes are red from crying. When they ask him what happened, he tells them Marie died.</td>
