      <td>My daughter died twenty eight years ago at a Methodist church. She was operated on for appendicitis. Victoria went to visit her to see how she was. They were getting people out of bed. Victoria asked the nurse about the chairs. Victoria said she was too ill to get out of bed. She was blamed for the blood cot for getting her out of bed. She came home after ten days and I was waiting for a call from the hospital. She was operated on in April on the twentieth. It was chilly and I had a coat on my arm and a bag. She saw from the window on Wolf Street. She said my mother was coming and was just saying bye to everyone. When I got to the hospital I was told to sit down and I prayed for another patient who had ten children and lived near my mother. Dr. Schwartz did the operation but his assistant was Dr. Monique who was a lady doctor. I had all her clothes ready for her to go home. My husband was waiting for me. He came home and washed and shaved and then waited for me. They called the store to find out when mother was coming home. A doctor wanted to give me a shot but I said no I'll kick you. You killed my daughter and now want to kill me, don't dare come near me.</td>

      <td>The woman from the store called us because we didn't have a phone. She told us that the hospital called — they wanted us to pick Marie up. I told my daughter to put a pot of coffee on, dad would be finished in the yard soon. I always gave Marie the first cup in the morning, I always remember that. Anyway, I went to the hospital. I saw a chair by her bed. "What's that for?" The nurse told me they were going to sit Marie. "What? No." She said it was the doctor's orders. Well, they tried but she passed out, so they put her back in bed. Marie saw me from the window. The nurse told me to wait. Next thing, she was rushing around. "Don't tell me it's my daughter you're rushing for?" It was. We ran to her room where we found her in a cold sweat. Drenched. I went berserk. "Oh my god, you've killed my daughter!" The doctor, a female doctor, came in. She told me to be with Marie. "What can I possibly say to her?" I was out of my mind. As soon as I turned my back, she passed away. I kept screaming "You've killed my daughter." The doctor couldn't tell me why she died. Eventually they escorted me out of the hospital and put me in a car. I screamed all the way home, pulling my hair out. By the time I got home, I didn't realise what a mess I looked. All the neighbors came out to see who was screaming. My husband came out and asked what was wrong. "It's Marie, she's dead." He had a heart attack. My other daughter has been chronically ill for the twenty-eight years since. Her leg goes stiff for weeks at a time. I sent my son to tell his aunts the news. Seeing his red eyes, they asked him why he was crying. He told them the news. My other daughter got a phone call from the hospital. They wanted her to pick me up. They were trying to sedate me but I told them "Don't come near me!". I knew all the nurses because I'd already been in three times that year for operations.</td>

      <td>OK. A mother showed up at the hospital to take who I believe to be her daughter (Marie) home from a hospital stay. Just before she was to take Marie home, Marie died. Then the mother went insane threatening to kill people, even threatening to burn the hospital down. She then proceeded to inform the immediate family. That's the general idea as near as I could discern from this poorly written hodgepodge of a story.</td>
