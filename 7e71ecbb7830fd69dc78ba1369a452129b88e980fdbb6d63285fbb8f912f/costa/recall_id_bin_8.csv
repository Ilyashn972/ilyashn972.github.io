She had gone to the hospital for surgery for the appendix. Her sister went to visit her and found a chair in the room and asked the nurse what the chair was for and told her that they had to get Marie out of bed, she told her that they can't do that cause Marie is too sick. But the nurse told her that it was the Doctor's orders. She pulled Marie out of bed but she collapsed. The mother did not have a phone so the hospital called the lady at the store to tell Mrs. Costa that she needs to pick up Marie because she is discharged. That morning she asked her daughter to put on some coffee for Marie because she likes coffee in the morning. She laid out Marie's clothes and put her coat on her arm and headed to the hospital. Marie was up and busy saying goodbye to the girls at the hospital when her mother got there. Then the nurse came and asked Mrs. Costa if her daughter had had fainting spells before, she asked if she was going to her daughter, when she saw her daughter she realized that she was sweating. It was a lot of sweat. She was still in her house slippers. Marie died and Mrs. Costa started screaming at the nurse that they had killed her daughter. The female Dr., Dr. Schwartz, had assisted the doctor who did the surgery. She came into the room and Mrs. Costa shouted at her too. The hospital kept calling asking for the mother to come pick up Marie. Marie's sister figured something was wrong and also headed to the hospital. She found her mother in the office undone and that's when she found out about Marie's. She fell and broke her leg. They eventually figured that a blot clot was what had killed Marie. Back at the house the neighbors were out of their houses due to Mrs. Costa's screams from inside the car. The husband had been waiting by the step for his daughter's return. When he heard the news he instantly had a heart attack. Their son Michael also had a heart attack the same day after finding out. The youngest son was then sent to inform his aunties about the death of his sister Marie."

She was too weak and was put to bed for quite some time. After a while, Victoria noticed something was wrong and Marie was removed from her bed. She enquired from the nurse why this happened and she was told that the doctor ordered it. Victoria in rage told the nurse Marie was too weak and sick and She returned Marie back to her bed after Marie passed out. Mrs. Costa got a call in the middle of the night from the woman at the store because she didn't have a phone. She told Mrs. Costa to go get Marie at the hospital. Mrs. Costa set out to the hospital and instructed Rita to finish up the cooking because their daddy will be home soon. Mrs. Costa bought some dress-like coats for Marie and took it with her to the hospital. On getting to the hospital, the nurse sat her down and questioned her if Marie has had a fainting spell and Mrs. Costa felt uneasy and answered yes and she was invited to her daughter's room and saw her daughter lying on the bed lifeless. Mrs. Costa was filled with emotions and crying and wailing and then the doctor who carried out the operation came in and immediately, Mrs. Costa asked her what she did to her daughter but the doctor replied by saying she doesn't know what happened. Afterwards, the nurse advised her to talk to her daughter but Mrs. Costa was confused and she was in agony. Mrs. Costa husband was now home and expecting his wife to return with his daughter, he was calling the store to enquire what must have happened thinking that Marie was already discharged. So Rita went to the hospital herself and she was surprised at what she saw. Her mother broke the news that her sister, Marie has died and on hearing it, Rita could not control herself. She fell on the hard floor in shock and in grief and she had a problem that developed due to this fall. When Marie's body wanted to be moved, Mrs. Costa didn't allow it because she was in grief. When the news got to her husband and her son, they both got a heart attack and Mrs. Costa sent his junior son to go tell his uncle of what has happened."

She had gone for an operation on her appendix. I sent my other daughter Victoria in to see her and when she got there she noticed a chair in the room. She asked what the chair was for and she was told that they were going to move Marie into it, but Victoria said she was too sick. Marie ends up passing out when they tried to move her. It is 10 days after her operation when Marie dies. I go to the hospital to collect her when she is meant to be discharged, I have my coat on my arm. The nurse’s aide brings blankets because I'm having cold shivers. I pray for another woman in the hospital who has had an operation for gall stones; she has 10 children. They then rush to my daughter and when I go into her room she is dead. I keep screaming that they have killed my daughter. Apparently, she was walking with another girl and said she had pain in her leg; it was a blood clot that killed her. When I tell my husband and son Michael the news about Marie, they both have heart attacks. Some family arrive and one of the women has brought a very large orange with her. People remember Marie standing on the step as a young, quiet girl."
