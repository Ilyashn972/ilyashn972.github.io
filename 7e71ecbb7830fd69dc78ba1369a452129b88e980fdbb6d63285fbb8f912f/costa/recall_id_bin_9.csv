Mrs. Costa's other daughter Veronica had gone to the Methodist Hospital to see how Marie was. They were getting her out of bed. The surgeon was Dr. Schwarz, and his assistant was a female doctor, Dr. Montique. It was time for Marie to come home, and so Mrs. Costa had gone to the hospital, carrying her coat and after her husband had made a coffee. While there, waiting for Marie, she said a prayer for a woman she knew, praying that she would survive and that her daughter wouldn't be left without a mother. At that time, there was a commotion as something had happened to Marie. Mrs. Costa went into her room to see her daughter lying there, covered in beads of sweat. ""You've killed her,"" Mrs. Costa yelled. ""Don't you touch her, or I'll burn this whole hospital down and everyone in it. I know you want to find out why she died, but don't touch her."" It turned out that Mrs. Costa's other daughter Rita had been with her, and Marie had complained that she had a pain in her leg and couldn't see before collapsing. It turned out she had died from a blood clot. When Rita learned that Marie had died she collapsed to the floor, badly injuring her leg which became rigid. 28 years later and she still suffers extended periods of serious pain in that leg, like phlebitis. Mrs. Costa went home and informed her husband. He had shaved, and had been sitting on the porch immediately suffered a heart attack. When her son Michael found out, he also had a heart attack. It was her other son Jamie who went to Mrs. Costa's two sisters and her mother, still alive at the time, arriving with red eyes to report that Marie had died."

She was very young and had been unwell for a wee while. She had her operation and was ready to go home. Her mother Mrs Costa was contacted through the shop to go and pick her up. Mrs Costa, the mother, went to the hospital after taking clothes for her daughter. When she got to the hospital after leaving food and coffee for her husband who was at work she was taken to a room to wait for her daughter. While she was there she was praying for a patient, a mother of ten children who was in hospital and was really unwell. The nurse and doctor came into the room and told Mrs Costa that Marie had died unexpectantly and very suddenly, The doctor said that she had been walking with another patient and had complained of a pain in her leg and was unable to see. She then had fallen to the ground and had died. Mrs Costa was in shock, she was expecting to take Marie home and did not understand how this could have happened. She was screaming at the doctors and nurses not to touch Marie and she threatened to burn down the hospital without caring who was there. She was taken home and saw her husband sitting on the house steps waiting on them. He did not understand how Marie was not coming home and said the his wife had gone there to take her home. The youngest son was told to go and tell others what had happened."

During the end of her stay, the day she was supposed to be discharged, the nurses had Marie try to walk around her hospital room. Mrs Costa believes that this caused a blood clot in her leg, which led to her death at the time of discharge. On the day of her discharge, the family was looking forward to her coming home. They received a call through a local store that she was ready to be discharged do they not have a phone? They got everything ready for Marie. They had coffee and breakfast prepared and Mrs Costa went by herself to pick Mary up. Her husband and other daughter stayed at their house to continue preparing. At this time, other family members were notified that Marie was being released on that day. Costa states that she had clothes and other things laid out and brought jackets and clothes to the hospital with her. At the hospital, Costa was told to sit and wait. She sat with another patient who'd had gallbladder surgery and prayed for her recovery because she had way too many children. While waiting, she saw some medical staff running to a patient. Costa quickly learned that they were running to treat a medical emergency for Marie, who had developed a clot in her leg. She was taken to Marie's room. Marie was visibly unwell, sweating heavily and with an unnaturally stiff leg Costa started to panic and become belligerent while the doctors rushed around trying to mitigate the situation. During that mess, Marie succumbed to the blood clot. Costa became understandably enraged and started shouting about how the hospital had killed her daughter and complained that they wanted to kill her as well when offerings some sort of calming injection. After some more time the husband and other daughter arrived at the hospital, as they'd become concerned about the lack of updates. They learned at that point that Marie had died. However, Costa's story has an inconsistency from how I recall it here because she then goes on to say that her husband was waiting on the porch and asked what was wrong when she arrived and only sat in the car screaming. They sent one of their other children or grandchildren to notify other relatives. He seems to have been a child and was crying by the time he arrived, leading them to ask what was wrong before he broke the news. Costa then rambles a bit more about unnecessary details but I don't remember them because they weren't key to the story."

Mrs. Costa started screaming and pulled her hair out and yelled that they had killed her daughter. Mrs. Costa was screaming and crying. She was only 18.
