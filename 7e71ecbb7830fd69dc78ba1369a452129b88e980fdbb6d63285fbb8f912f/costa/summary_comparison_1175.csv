recall,recall_91,"My daughter died twenty eight years ago at a Methodist church. She was operated on for appendicitis. Victoria went to visit her to see how she was. They were getting people out of bed. Victoria asked the nurse about the chairs. Victoria said she was too ill to get out of bed. She was blamed for the blood cot for getting her out of bed. She came home after ten days and I was waiting for a call from the hospital. She was operated on in April on the twentieth. It was chilly and I had a coat on my arm and a bag. She saw from the window on Wolf Street. She said my mother was coming and was just saying bye to everyone. When I got to the hospital I was told to sit down and I prayed for another patient who had ten children and lived near my mother. Dr. Schwartz did the operation but his assistant was Dr. Monique who was a lady doctor. I had all her clothes ready for her to go home. My husband was waiting for me. He came home and washed and shaved and then waited for me. They called the store to find out when mother was coming home. A doctor wanted to give me a shot but I said no I'll kick you. You killed my daughter and now want to kill me, don't dare come near me.",1175,239

It was late Saturday afternoon when they operated. Sunday morning, my oldest daughter, Victoria, went to the hospital to see how she was. She was still under ether. The nurse said, “Well, that’s the doctor’s orders.” So, they went to get her out of bed, and she passed out. I blame them for the blood clot she got, taking her out of bed. I was waiting for the call from the hospital. “Mrs. Costa, they just called you from the hospital. Go Pick Marie up. She’s discharged.” I went myself. The nurse said to me, “Sit down, Mrs. Costa, sit here for a while.” The nurse hung up the phone and came to me. She said, “Mrs. Costa, has your daughter ever had a fainting spell?” “Oh my God!” I said, “Don’t tell me you’re running for my daughter!” “Yes,” she said, “come on in.” And my daughter was on the bed with her bedroom slippers and her housecoat on. And the beads of sweat – honest to God, not to exaggerate, they were that big. I said, “What did you do, kill my daughter? You killed her! You killed her!” And just as I turned my back, my daughter passed away.",1188,222

But the nurse replied, “Well, that’s the doctor’s orders. She’s discharged.” Rita was—well, I was cooking, and I said, “Put a big pot of coffee on,” because she had been wishing for coffee. When I get up in the morning, the first cup is hers. “All right, Mother, go ahead,” she said. “I’ll finish up.” She also said, “My mother’s just coming.” I replied, “All right, I’ll be right over.” Then a little nurse’s aide went to the closet and got some blankets. My daughter was on the bed with her bedroom slippers and her housecoat on. The people in the office didn’t know what had happened yet. You know, I’ve always had a bad heart. One doctor wanted to give me a shot. I said, “Get out of here.” When Rita came in and saw me like that, she asked, “Mother, what happened?” She can’t walk; she has gone through such pain since then. He asked, “What’s the matter? What happened to you?” They waited because they knew she was coming home that day, waiting for the call.",1057,193
