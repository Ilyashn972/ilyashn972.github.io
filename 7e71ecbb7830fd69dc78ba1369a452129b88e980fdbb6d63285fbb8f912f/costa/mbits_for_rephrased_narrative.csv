When he went to tell them what had happened, they thought he was coming to tell them that Marie had come back home but when they found out, they were shocked.

95,"My daughter died when she was 28, on the 30th day of the month at the Methodist hospital. She had gone for an operation on her appendix. I sent my other daughter Victoria in to see her and when she got there she noticed a chair in the room. She asked what the chair was for and she was told that they were going to move Marie into it, but Victoria said she was too sick. Marie ends up passing out when they tried to move her. It is 10 days after her operation when Marie dies. I go to the hospital to collect her when she is meant to be discharged, I have my coat on my arm. The nurse’s aide brings blankets because I'm having cold shivers. I pray for another woman in the hospital who has had an operation for gall stones; she has 10 children. They then rush to my daughter and when I go into her room she is dead. I keep screaming that they have killed my daughter. Apparently, she was walking with another girl and said she had pain in her leg; it was a blood clot that killed her. When I tell my husband and son Michael the news about Marie, they both have heart attacks. Some family arrive and one of the women has brought a very large orange with her.

98,"My daughter died. Twenty-eight years ago it'll be this Wednesday, yeah. She was in hospital, getting operated on for appendicitis. My eldest daughter Victoria went in to see her, and, at that time I didn't have a phone. But the girl at the store had a phone and the hospital called her to let me know to come pick Marie up, she had been discharged. Twenty-eight, no, thirtieth this month it'll be, yeah. She said to me, ""Mrs. Costa"", she said, ""The hospital called for you to pick up Marie."" So I got ready to go, I told my daughter Rita to keep cooking, and I said, ""Put a pot of coffee on, Daddy will be home soon."" He was working that day. I always put out coffee for Marie, the first coffee of the day was hers. But when my eldest daughter Victoria got there, she got to the bed Marie was at, and right next to it was a chair. She said to the nurse, ""What's this chair doing here?"" The nurse said ""We need to get her out of bed."" but she was still under ether. Back then they used a lot of ether. So she said to the nurse, ""She can't get out of bed, she's still under ether. She's still sick."" Then the nurse said, ""Well that's doctor's orders,"" so she goes to get Marie up, and she took a few steps then she collapsed on the floor. She was never - they asked, ""Does she have any fainting spells?"" and she was healthy. So they called the girl at the store, and she tells me to go to the hospital, and I go, with Marie's coat on my arm, and her undercoat, and her coat on my arm. I got there and the nurse's aide, she was a little thing, she said something to me. The nurse tells me to ""Just sit right here, sit down for a little while."" and I got chills. Then I see the nurse's aide go into a closet and get a blanket out, then she turns to the nurse and says, ""she's got cold sweat."" Then they started running, and I saw it, and I'm not exaggerating, there were huge beads of sweat, just running, just pouring down her face. I got closer to her and I started yelling at the nurses, ""What did you do to her? You killed her. You killed her!"" See, the nurses knew me, I had three operations there in no time, less than a year. They just kept coming, and I was yelling, ""You killed her! You killed her!"" The doctor rushes in, and - she was a lady doctor, Dr Schwartes. The doctor, a lady doctor, tried to give me a shot. And I said to them, ""Get away from me! You killed my daughter, and now you're trying to kill me?"" I started screaming, I was hysterical, banging my head against the wall and everything, I had hair pulled out, I was a mess. My husband had got home, gone upstairs to shave and shower, then sat on the steps waiting for Marie to come home. The hospital called the girl at the store again, and said, ""Where's the mother? Tell the mother to come to the hospital."" The girl said, ""That's strange, the mother already went to the hospital, she should be there."" Then they went up from the office. Then just as I turned my back, my daughter had passed away. I was screaming, crying, just a mess, and the lady doctor - they were all trying to get me to calm down. But she was only eighteen. I went home and told everybody what happened. My brother-in-law, he's an undertaker. I called my sisters. I sent my youngest son, James, to tell his Aunties what happened. They thought Marie would be coming home that day. They were cleaning the pavement, and doing the cement work, and cleaning the pavement. As soon as they saw little Jamie come up, they could see his eyes were all red, and they said to him, ""Jamie, honey, what's happened? Why are you crying?"" He said to them, ""Aunt Millie, Aunt, Marie's died. She died at hospital."" When my husband came down from the steps, I told him, and no kidding, he had a heart attack, yeah. A heart attack. Then, my oldest son Michael came home, and I told him, and he had a heart attack too. Both of them, yeah. He collapsed on the floor. Everybody was coming out, they could hear the screams. My daughter died. Twenty-eight years ago it'll be this Wednesday, yeah. She was in hospital, getting operated on for appendicitis. My eldest daughter Victoria went in to see her,",4122,90,497.0,434.33403817315246

101,A mother was recalling events of how her 18-year-old daughter Marie died due to (I believe they said) a blood clot. She had been transferred from a bed to a chair which could have caused it (?). I believe I read something about her husband and son having a heart attack as well (?). Which was confusing because then the son told her sisters that were waiting back at home that Marie had passed. The dad/husband was also at home excitingly waiting for Marie. The mom had told the dad to prep coffee for Marie for when she's back and they had also prepped something else that I cannot recall. If I recall correctly the surgery happened due to appendicitis. The mom was also screaming in the hospital at the doctors and nurses that they had killed her daughter. They used lots of ether. They did not have a phone so they were informed by a grocery store phone (?).,861,30,-3.4,-20.989885803064627
