A moment of distress during a swimming race on a sunny day. One boy is struggling in the water, showing signs of panic as cramps set in. He is partially submerged, arms flailing, with a look of fear on his face as he calls out for help. The other boys, around the same age of 12 to 14, continue the race ahead, unaware of his struggle, swimming energetically in the sparkling blue water. The setting sun casts long shadows, adding tension to the scene. The vibrant backdrop of deep blue water and clear sky contrasts with the boy's struggle for help.
