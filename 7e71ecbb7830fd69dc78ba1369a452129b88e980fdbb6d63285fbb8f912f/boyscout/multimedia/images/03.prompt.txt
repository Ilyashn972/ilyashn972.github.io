An older scoutmaster with grey hair stands on a pier during a swimming race, observing the boys in the water. He wears a neatly kept scout leader uniform adorned with badges and holds a clipboard. Despite the commotion in the water, including a boy in distress, he appears impassive and detached, gazing at the scene with a relaxed posture. The sun is setting, casting a warm, golden light on him and the wooden planks of the pier. The vibrant backdrop of a setting sun contrasts with the urgent movements of the boys in the water below.
