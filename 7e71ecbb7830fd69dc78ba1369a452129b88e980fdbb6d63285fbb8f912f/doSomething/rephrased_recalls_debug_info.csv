18,12,"And this guy, looks to be middle fifties, is right on my tail.","This individual, appearing to be in his mid-fifties, was tailgating me closely."
18,13,"Lisa looked back there and said ""He's right on your tail!""","Lisa glanced rearward and exclaimed, ""He's tailgating you!"""
18,14,"And sure enough, we're basically bumper to bumper.","Indeed, our vehicles were nearly touching, practically bumper to bumper."
18,15,"And he can't keep his truck straight,","He struggled to maintain his truck in a straight line,"
18,16,in and out of the lane.,veering from side to side within the lane.
18,17,So I think he must be drunk.,My suspicion was that he might be intoxicated.
18,18,And all I can think is how drunk driving is the number one killer on the roads.,All that crossed my mind was the grim reality that drunk driving leads in road fatalities.
18,19,And how it's everyone's responsibility.,And that it's a collective duty to prevent it.
18,20,"That or maybe he's having a medical problem, like a heart attack.","Alternatively, he could be experiencing a medical emergency, such as a cardiac arrest."
18,21,I just know it would kill me if I read in the papers the next day about a guy dying from a heart attack on the road.,The thought that I might discover in tomorrow's newspaper about someone succumbing to a heart attack on the road was unbearable.
18,22,He could be having a heart attack and here I am thinking he's drunk.,"The possibility of him suffering a heart attack was there, and yet I suspected intoxication."
18,23,So I feel like I have to do something.,I felt compelled to intervene in some way.
18,24,We're coming up to a stop sign,"As we neared a stop sign,"
18,25,"and I decide that when I stop,","I made up my mind that upon stopping,"
18,26,I'm going to get out,I would exit my vehicle
18,27,and go see what's going on.,and investigate the situation.
18,28,"Either he's drunk or having a medical problem,","Whether he was inebriated or in the midst of a health crisis,"
18,29,and I decided I needed to help.,I resolved that I had to offer assistance.
18,30,I don't really want to get involved,"Involvement was not my preference,"
18,31,but I feel like I have to.,but it seemed like an obligation.
18,32,So I stop at the stop sign.,"Thus, I halted at the stop sign."
18,33,"And across the intersection, a police car has pulled up.","Directly across the junction, a patrol car had arrived."
18,34,"So I wave him over,","I gestured for the officer to come over,"
18,35,and I get out of the car.,and stepped out of my vehicle.
18,36,And I tell the deputy that either this guy behind me is drunk or having a definite medical problem,I informed the officer that the man trailing me was either impaired by alcohol or experiencing a serious health issue
18,37,because he's swerving across the lanes.,given his erratic lane changes.
18,38,"But the driver saw me get out and talk to the deputy,","Noticing me exit and converse with the officer, the driver"
18,39,"and now he's stopped way back, far back from my car.",halted at a considerable distance from my car.
18,40,Ha ha.,"Quite amusing, indeed."
18,41,"Then as the deputy is walking down there to talk to him, he starts backing up.","As the officer began to approach him, he commenced reversing."
18,42,"And then he pulls a u turn,","Subsequently, he executed a U-turn,"
18,43,and the police car follows him.,with the police vehicle in pursuit.
18,44,But he's going real slow and careful down the road.,"Yet, he proceeded down the road with exaggerated caution and slowness."
18,45,It was quite comical.,The situation was rather humorous.
18,46,I don't know if they ever managed to pull him over.,Whether they ultimately managed to stop him remains unknown to me.

19,12,He is concerned that this is everyone's responsibility to take action.,He feels it's everyone's duty to intervene in such situations.

19,16,He thought perhaps he was having a heart attack.,He considers the possibility of the driver suffering a cardiac event.
19,17,He didn't want to hear on the news that a person died of a heart attack.,He doesn't want to later learn from the news about a fatality due to a heart attack.
19,18,He didn't want to hear that he did nothing.,Nor does he want to regret his inaction.
19,19,He calls the cop over to his car.,He signals the officer to come to his vehicle.
19,20,He tells him the other driver has a problem.,He informs the officer that there's an issue with the other driver.
19,21,He tells him the other driver could be drunk or sick.,He explains that the driver might be either intoxicated or ill.

23,15,he was not keeping to his lane.,failing to stay within his own lane.
23,16,At this point they thought,"At that moment, they speculated"
23,17,that he was either drunk or sick,that he might be intoxicated or unwell
23,18,for example having a heart-attack.,perhaps suffering from a cardiac emergency.
23,19,They called the cops on him,They reported him to the authorities

25,3,He was angry,He seemed quite irate
25,4,I did not let him into my lane,because I hadn't allowed him to merge into my lane
25,5,so he blocked a lane,thus he obstructed one lane
25,6,and then proceeded to tailgate me for several miles.,before choosing to follow closely behind my car for a number of miles.

29,11,I was about to dismiss them,I was ready to ignore it
29,12,but then I think that maybe they're sick or having a heart attack.,but then it occurs to me that he could be ill or suffering from a cardiac event.
29,13,I'd to read the paper the next day,I wouldn't want to read in the newspaper the following day

33,16,"so they called the police over,","prompting them to signal the officers,"
33,17,and explained what was happening.,and recount the ongoing incident.
33,18,"The car that was tailing them saw the police,","The tailing vehicle noticed the law enforcement presence,"
33,19,"and reversed to go the other way,","and chose to reverse direction,"
33,20,"driving overly slowly,","proceeding with exaggerated slowness,"
33,21,and overly cautiously now they knew they were being watched.,and with excessive caution now under the watchful eye of the police.
33,22,The story teller never found out whether they were stopped by the police or not.,The narrator remained unaware if the tailing car was eventually halted by the police.
34,1,A couple were at a baseball game,Two individuals attended a baseball match
34,2,and then left.,before departing.
34,3,They went to highway 44,They proceeded to route 44
34,4,and came across a strange driver,where they encountered an odd motorist
34,5,who tailgated them.,who followed them closely.
34,6,When they had a chance,At an opportune moment
34,7,to hail a police car,they signaled to a patrol vehicle
34,8,they did.,and succeeded.
34,9,The police then investigated.,"Subsequently, the officers conducted an investigation."
35,1,They were going to a church baseball game at the diamond,They were headed to a church-sponsored baseball match at the field
35,2,and were on Highway 24.,while traveling on Highway 24.
35,3,A guy blocked the highway,A man obstructed the roadway
35,4,and the narrator moved into the median before the guy.,prompting the narrator to steer into the median ahead of the man.
35,5,The guy then followed the narrator down the road to the diamond,"Subsequently, the man pursued the narrator along the path to the field"
35,6,about a mile or two past Ranch Eggs.,extending a mile or two beyond Ranch Eggs.
35,7,The guy was swerving,The man was veering erratically
35,8,and the narrator thought he was drunk or sick.,leading the narrator to suspect he was either intoxicated or unwell.
35,9,Lisa pointed out the guy was really close.,Lisa remarked on the man's dangerously close proximity.
35,10,The narrator stopped at a stop sign,The narrator came to a halt at a stop sign
35,11,and motioned the cops over.,and signaled to attract the attention of the police officers.
36,1,There were driving to a church softball league game at the Diamond at Homestead High.,They were en route to a church softball league match at Homestead High's Diamond.
36,2,They were driving up 22,Their journey took them along Highway 22
36,3,and were about to make a turn near Egg Ranch (?),and they approached a turn near the Egg Ranch (uncertain).
36,4,when a guy pulled across into the median,"Suddenly, a man veered into the center divider"
36,5,and started blocking the 24.,and began obstructing traffic on Route 24.
36,6,They noticed that the guy must have a problem.,It was apparent to them that the man was experiencing some trouble.
36,7,They first thought he must be drunk,"Initially, they suspected he might be intoxicated"
36,8,but then thought he might be sick -,but then considered the possibility of illness -
36,9,having a heart attack or something.,perhaps suffering from a cardiac event or similar.
36,10,They didn't want to read in the paper that a guy had died of a heart attack,They were reluctant to read future news reports about a man succumbing to a heart attack
36,11,when they could have done something by checking,when they might have intervened to assist.
36,12,so they decided they would check out what was happening,"Thus, they resolved to investigate the situation"
36,13,even though they didn't want to get involved.,despite their reluctance to become involved.
36,14,They said to Lisa who was in the car that the guy behind them had some problem,"They informed Lisa, who was also in the vehicle, that the driver trailing them was having some difficulty"
36,15,and couldn't stay on one side of the road.,and was unable to maintain a consistent lane.
36,16,They made a decision to stop at the stop sign a mile or 2 down the road,"They opted to pull over at the next stop sign, a mile or two ahead,"
36,17,and get out the car,to exit the vehicle
36,18,and see what was happening in the car behind.,and ascertain the condition of the driver in the car behind them.
36,19,When they got to the stop sign a police patrol car pulled up on the opposite side at the same time,"Upon reaching the stop sign, a police cruiser arrived from the opposite direction simultaneously"
36,20,so they waved the Deputy over.,prompting them to signal the officer over.
36,21,They explained to the Deputy that the guy in the car behind seemed to either be drunk or sick,They briefed the Deputy on their observation that the motorist behind might be impaired or unwell
36,22,as they were unable to keep their vehicle on one side of the road.,given his inability to stay within a single lane.
36,23,When they got out the car to speak to the Deputy,"Stepping out of the car to converse with the Deputy,"
36,24,they noticed the other car had stopped a ways back,they saw that the other vehicle had halted some distance away
36,25,and was now slowing reversing back down the road away from them.,"and was now slowly reversing down the road, distancing itself from them."
36,26,The police car then drove towards them,The patrol vehicle then advanced towards the scene
36,27,and they pulled a U-turn,while they executed a U-turn
36,28,and drove away faster.,and sped off.
36,29,The story narrator never found out what happened to them.,The individual recounting the tale never learned of the subsequent events.
37,1,We were on our way to a softball league game.,Our destination was a game for our softball league.
37,2,Pulling up twenty four interstate.,We were driving along interstate twenty-four.
37,3,They see another driver behind them.,They noticed another motorist trailing them.
37,4,Who they suspect was ill or drunk.,Suspecting that the individual was either sick or intoxicated.
37,5,Call the sheriffs over.,They decided to alert the local law enforcement.
37,6,To try and stop the man.,Hoping to intercept the individual.
37,7,As they didn't want to be known as the person who did nothing.,Because they refused to be labeled as someone who stood by idly.
37,8,The sheriff tries to signal them down.,The law officer attempts to flag the driver.
37,9,But they go into reverse.,"However, the driver shifts into reverse."
37,10,And then forward.,Then switches to driving forward.
37,11,After it was comical.,The situation turned out to be quite humorous.
38,1,"Driving to a softball game,","En route to a softball match,"
38,2,I came across another car driving erratically.,I encountered a vehicle swerving unpredictably.
38,3,"I wasn't sure if the driver was drunk or sick,","I was uncertain whether the driver was intoxicated or unwell,"
38,4,but I knew I had to do something.,yet I felt compelled to take action.
38,5,I spoke to the police,I communicated with law enforcement
38,6,who headed towards the other car,who pursued the erratic vehicle
38,7,which had stopped in the road.,which had come to a halt on the roadway.
38,8,The other car noticed,The vehicle in question took notice
38,9,and started reversing,and began to back up
38,10,before turning around,before executing a turnaround
38,11,and driving away slowly and carefully,"and proceeded to depart at a slow, cautious pace"
38,12,while being followed by the police.,with the police in pursuit.
38,13,"I don't know what became of that car,","The ultimate fate of that vehicle remains unknown to me,"
38,14,or its driver.,as does the condition of its operator.
39,1,"Two months ago on a Sunday,","Eight weeks earlier on a Sunday,"
39,2,I was driving for a game,I found myself behind the wheel en route to a match
39,3,and we passed a car.,and we overtook another vehicle.
39,4,"He was sitting right there in the middle of the highway,","There he was, positioned squarely in the center of the road,"
39,5,"so when the traffic cleared,","thus, once the road was clear,"
39,6,I went ahead,I proceeded
39,7,"and was getting near diamond close to twenty-four,","and approached the vicinity of diamond, nearing mile twenty-four,"
39,8,then we noticed he was following us bumper to bumper.,that's when we realized he was tailgating us closely.
39,9,I didn't notice at first,It escaped my notice initially
39,10,but my friend Lisa drew my attention to it.,but my companion Lisa pointed it out to me.
39,11,I kept my eye on him,I remained vigilant of his presence
39,12,so that he doesn't bump into me.,to avoid any collision with him.
39,13,"He kept driving crazy,","His driving remained erratic,"
39,14,moving from one lane to another.,shifting across lanes back and forth.
39,15,I had a lot of thoughts about drunk driving,Thoughts of impaired driving filled my mind
39,16,and how it can cause accidents,and its potential to lead to mishaps
39,17,and I thought he is definitely drunk.,and I was convinced he must be intoxicated.
39,18,"However, my mind kept bugging me","Still, something nagged at my conscience"
39,19,"and I thought again,","and upon further reflection,"
39,20,he could be ill or having a heart attack.,it occurred to me he might be suffering a medical emergency.
39,21,"Either way, I need to check on him","Regardless, it was imperative I ensure his well-being"
39,22,to prevent any mishap.,to avert any unfortunate events.
39,23,I didn't want to feel guilty if something happened,The thought of bearing guilt if an incident occurred was unbearable
39,24,so I made up my mind to truly check.,hence I resolved to verify his condition.
39,25,"Suddenly, I saw the sheriff's car","Out of the blue, I spotted the patrol car"
39,26,and I signaled them to come over.,and gestured for their assistance.
39,27,"When they did,","Upon their arrival,"
39,28,"I told them that something was wrong with the guy behind me,","I expressed my concerns about the man tailing me,"
39,29,like he was drunk or ill.,suggesting he might be either inebriated or unwell.
39,30,"Apparently, when I stopped,","It turned out that when I pulled over,"
39,31,he also stopped a few miles behind me.,he too came to a halt some distance back.
39,32,"When they were approaching him,","As they moved toward him,"
39,33,"he reversed,","he engaged in reverse gear,"
39,34,they kept following him,they persisted in their pursuit
39,35,and he kept reversing,and he continued backing up
39,36,until they had him backed in a corner.,until they cornered him effectively.
39,37,"When he realized he was being cornered,","Realizing he was trapped,"
39,38,"he started driving forward,","he began to drive ahead,"
39,39,they had to do a U-turn,forcing them to execute a U-turn
39,40,and start a pursuit of him.,and initiate a chase after him.
39,41,Till date I don't know,To this day I remain unaware
39,42,if they stopped or caught him.,whether they apprehended or even caught up with him.
40,1,It's the story of a guy,This is the tale of an individual
40,2,that's driving to go attend a softball game.,who is en route to a softball match.
40,3,"While he's driving on road Twenty-Four,","As he navigates Route Twenty-Four,"
40,4,he meets another driver driving very dangerously.,he encounters a motorist driving recklessly.
40,5,That driver is constantly moving between the lanes,This motorist keeps weaving in and out of traffic
40,6,and following his car too closely.,and tails his vehicle too closely.
40,7,The guy isn't sure,The man is uncertain
40,8,if the dangerous driver is drunk,whether the erratic driver is intoxicated
40,9,"or sick,","or unwell,"
40,10,and if he is sick,"and should the driver be unwell,"
40,11,he would feel bad,he would regret it
40,12,if something bad happened to him.,should any misfortune befall him.
40,13,So he goes to see the cops for help,"Therefore, he seeks assistance from the police"
40,14,and they start chasing the dangerous driver.,who then initiate a pursuit of the perilous driver.
40,15,The person telling the story doesn't know,The narrator of the account is unaware
40,16,if they ever caught him.,whether the pursuit resulted in a capture.
41,1,**About a month ago**,Roughly four weeks back
41,2,**see**,observe
41,3,**we were going to a church league softball game**,our destination was a church league softball match
41,4,**They'd had the games all scheduled for the diamond at Homestead High School**,The fixtures were all arranged to take place at the field of Homestead High School
41,5,**You know where that's at?**,Are you familiar with that location?
41,6,**Well**,Anyway
41,7,**we're going up Twenty-four**,we were traveling along Route Twenty-four
41,8,"**and getting ready to turn there, at Ranch Eggs**",preparing to make our turn at Ranch Eggs
41,9,**and I was slowing down**,and I began to decelerate
41,10,**got my turn signal on**,activating my indicator
41,11,**and as I was slowing down**,and while I was reducing speed
41,12,**there's this guy sitting over here to the right**,there was this man to my right
41,13,**coming on to Twenty-four**,merging onto Route Twenty-four
41,14,**Looked like he's about in his middle fifties**,He appeared to be in his mid-fifties
41,15,**And he starts creeping out onto Twenty-four**,And he started inching forward onto Route Twenty-four
41,16,**and he's blocking off the lane**,effectively obstructing the lane
41,17,**and he's heading for the same spot that I'm going**,aiming for the same direction I was headed
41,18,**You know how you sit there and wait for the traffic to get by**,You're aware of that moment when you pause and let the traffic pass
41,19,**Right there in the median?**,Right there in the center strip?
41,20,**This guy starts**,This man begins
41,21,**pulls out in the lane**,moving into the lane
41,22,**I thought you jerk**,"I thought to myself, what a nuisance"
41,23,**but I hurried up**,but I quickly
41,24,**and got in there ahead of him**,and managed to get ahead of him
41,25,**And he sits there**,And he remains there
41,26,**and waits on**,waiting for
41,27,**Mean he's got Twenty-four blocked**,"Indeed, he's obstructing Route Twenty-four"
41,28,**He's sitting there**,He's stationary
41,29,**right in the middle of the highway**,right in the midst of the road
41,30,**Got it blocked**,Creating an obstruction
41,31,**So we went on across**,So we continued on
41,32,**as soon as traffic cleared**,once the way was clear
41,33,**and we're headed up there towards that diamond**,heading towards that field
41,34,"**and it's about maybe mile, two miles north of Twenty-four on Aboite Center**",which is about a mile or two north of Route Twenty-four on Aboite Center
41,35,**and this guy's following us**,and this individual is trailing us
41,36,"**see, as we're going up there this hill there**","you see, as we ascend that hill there"
41,37,**At Ranch Eggs**,At Ranch Eggs
41,38,**We're going up this hill**,Ascending the incline
41,39,**and this guy's right on my tail**,and this man is closely following me
41,40,**And Lisa was with me**,And Lisa accompanied me
41,41,**and she said**,and she remarked
41,42,**That guy is right on your tail**,That man is tailgating you
41,43,**I looked in the mirror**,I glanced in the rearview mirror
41,44,**and sure enough**,and indeed
41,45,**he's right up there**,he was right behind
41,46,**practically bumper to bumper**,almost touching bumpers
41,47,**and I'm trying to keep an eye on him**,and I'm keeping an eye on him
41,48,**make sure he doesn't slam into me or anything**,to ensure he doesn't collide with us or anything
41,49,**He starts weaving back and forth**,He begins to swerve
41,50,**couldn't keep it in one lane**,unable to stay within a single lane
41,51,**Really bad news**,Definitely troubling
41,52,**And all the time this is going on**,And throughout this ordeal
41,53,**I'm thinking how drunk driving is the number one killer of kids**,I'm reminded that drunk driving is the top cause of youth fatalities
41,54,**and all this business**,and all that entails
41,55,**How it everybodys responsibility**,How it's everyone's duty
41,56,**So I was trying to make up my mind what to do**,So I was contemplating what action to take
41,57,**I was pretty sure he was drunk**,I was fairly certain he was intoxicated
41,58,**at least he appeared that way**,at least that's how he seemed
41,59,**so I figured that when we get up to this stop sign**,so I decided that once we reached the stop sign
41,60,**I'm going to go back and find out what his problem is**,I would go back to ascertain his issue
41,61,**cause**,because
41,62,**I'm thinking he's drunk**,I suspected he was inebriated
41,63,**and I know I oughta do something about it**,and I felt obligated to intervene
41,64,**but at the same time**,but simultaneously
41,65,"**if he's sick, like maybe he's having a heart attack or something**","if he's ill, perhaps suffering a cardiac event or similar"
41,66,**you know**,you understand
41,67,**You gotta do something**,One must act
41,68,**I'd really feel bad if I read the papers the next day**,I would regret it if I discovered in the news the following day
41,69,**that the guy**,that this individual
41,70,**some guy**,some person
41,71,**died with a heart attack**,succumbed to a heart attack
41,72,**and there I was thinking he was drunk**,while I had assumed he was under the influence
41,73,**And I didn't really want to get involved**,And I wasn't eager to get involved
41,74,**to be honest with you**,to be frank with you
41,75,**But I had made up my mind**,But I had resolved
41,76,**that I was going to**,that I would indeed
41,77,**so we pulled up to the stop**,so we arrived at the stop
41,78,**at this sign**,by the sign
41,79,**and right across the road**,and directly opposite the road
41,80,**stopped a sheriff's car**,a sheriff's patrol car was halted
41,81,**So I motion for him to come over**,So I gestured for him to approach
41,82,**and they whip across the road**,and they quickly crossed the road
41,83,**and I got out the car**,and I exited the vehicle
41,84,**walked over there**,approached them
41,85,**and said to this deputy**,and told the officer
41,86,**This guy behind me is either sick or he's drunk**,The man tailing me is either unwell or intoxicated
41,87,**but he's got a problem**,but he's definitely facing some trouble
41,88,**He can't keep his car on one side of the road**,He's unable to maintain his vehicle on one side of the roadway
41,89,**And I said**,And I mentioned
41,90,**He's got a definite problem**,He's clearly troubled
41,91,**So they started down there**,So they proceeded towards him
41,92,**And as soon as he sees me get out of the car**,And the moment he saw me step out of the car
41,93,**and walk over there to the police car**,and approach the police vehicle
41,94,**the guy stops**,the man halted
41,95,**way far away from the intersection**,a good distance from the crossroads
41,96,**He stops**,He halted
41,97,**and he throws his car into reverse**,then shifted his car into reverse
41,98,**and starts backing up**,and began to back up
41,99,**When the cops went down there to check him out**,When the officers went down to investigate
41,100,**he starts backing up**,he continued reversing
41,101,**going backwards down that road**,retreating down that road
41,102,**Pretty soon they catch up with him**,"Eventually, they caught up with him"
41,103,**and he starts forward again**,and he resumed driving forward
41,104,**and they make a U-turn in the road**,and they executed a U-turn on the road
41,105,**and start following him**,and began to tail him
41,106,**and he's just driving real slow**,and he drove exceedingly slowly
41,107,**and careful**,and cautiously
41,108,**Haha**,Haha
41,109,**it's pretty funny**,it was quite amusing
41,110,**I don't know if they ever stopped him or not**,I'm uncertain if they ever pulled him over or not
43,1,Some people went to see a league softball game.,Several individuals attended a local softball match.
43,2,A guy in his 50s came,A man around fifty years old arrived
43,3,"and blocked, I presume, some traffic.","and, I assume, obstructed some vehicles."
43,4,It was linked to ranch eggs.,This was connected to farm-fresh eggs.
43,5,"Then the guy was near them,","Subsequently, the man approached them,"
43,6,bumper to bumper.,"in close, consecutive traffic."
43,7,A driver thought he was drunk,One motorist suspected he was inebriated
43,8,and was worried he may get a heart attack.,and feared he might suffer a cardiac arrest.
43,9,A police car is then seen.,A patrol vehicle is subsequently spotted.
44,1,"About a month ago we were driving up to the Junior baseball game, up Twenty-Four,","Roughly thirty days prior, we were en route to the Junior baseball match, taking Route Twenty-Four,"
44,2,there is this guy trying to turn left onto the road.,when we noticed a man attempting to make a left turn onto the highway.
44,3,So we wait for him to turn,"We paused to allow him to complete his turn,"
44,4,but he gets about half way across before the lights change,"yet he only managed to get halfway before the traffic signals switched,"
44,5,"and he's stuck in the middle of the road,","leaving him stranded in the center of the roadway,"
44,6,right on the median.,directly atop the median strip.
44,7,Anyways we drive through quickly to get ahead of him,"Nevertheless, we hurried past him to move ahead,"
44,8,and when the traffic starts again he begins to follow us real close up Twenty-Four.,"and as the vehicles began moving again, he started tailing us closely along Twenty-Four."
44,9,Lisa was in the car with me,Lisa accompanied me in the vehicle
44,10,"and she says ""that guy is following real close"",","and she remarked, ""that individual is tailgating quite closely"","
44,11,and I look back in the rear-view mirror,so I glanced in the rear-view mirror
44,12,and she's right.,"and indeed, she was correct."
44,13,He's weaving this way and that across the lanes,He was zigzagging back and forth between lanes
44,14,and sticking real close to us all the way up Twenty-Four.,and maintaining a tight distance behind us the entire stretch of Twenty-Four.
44,15,"We go a mile, maybe two","We covered a distance of one or two miles,"
44,16,and I'm starting to think about drunk drivers,"and my thoughts turned to the hazard of intoxicated drivers,"
44,17,"and how they're the biggest cause of death to kids and whatnot,","pondering their role as a leading cause of fatalities among youth and such,"
44,18,because I'm thinking this guy must be drunk to be driving like this.,convinced that this individual's erratic driving indicated intoxication.
44,19,I think I'll stop at the next light,"I resolved to halt at the upcoming traffic signal,"
44,20,and get out,"step out of the car,"
44,21,and go back there,"approach him,"
44,22,"and see what's up,","and ascertain the situation,"
44,23,"give him a piece of my mind,","prepared to confront him,"
44,24,but then I wonder if he's actually sick,but then I contemplated whether he might be unwell
44,25,and if I want a confrontation after all.,and whether I truly desired a confrontation.
44,26,I'd hate it to read the paper the next day,The thought of reading the next day's newspaper
44,27,and hear about a guy dying of a heart attack on the highway,about someone succumbing to a cardiac arrest on the freeway
44,28,and I had done nothing about it.,while I had stood by idly was unsettling.
44,29,"Anyway, my mind was made up","Nonetheless, I had reached a decision,"
44,30,and I was going to go back there,"intent on confronting him,"
44,31,when we pull up at a stop sign,when we arrived at a stop sign
44,32,"and there's a police car on the other side of the road,","and spotted a patrol car across the street,"
44,33,so I call them over.,prompting me to signal them.
44,34,They swing across the road,"They maneuvered their vehicle across the street,"
44,35,and I get out,"I exited my car,"
44,36,"and say ""that guy back there is either drunk or sick, but he can't keep his car in his lane at all"".","and informed them, ""The driver behind us is either inebriated or ill, as he's unable to stay within his lane."""
44,37,They turn the cruiser around,They spun their cruiser around
44,38,"and head over to him,","and proceeded towards him,"
44,39,and he has stopped a ways up the road.,while he had halted further up the road.
44,40,"He starts to back up slowly when he sees the police coming towards him,","Observing the police approach, he began reversing slowly,"
44,41,then he starts forward again,then changed direction once more
44,42,and drives real slow like back along the road.,and proceeded to inch back down the road at a reduced pace.
44,43,I don't know whether they ever caught him,"Whether they apprehended him or not remains unknown to me,"
44,44,or what was what haha,"nor do I know the full story, haha"
44,45,but it sure was a strange thing.,but it was certainly an odd occurrence.
45,1,"A driver and her companion, Lisa, were going to a baseball game a month or so ago.","The motorist and her friend, Lisa, set out for a baseball match about a month earlier."
45,2,They were driving along HWY 24.,They navigated their way on Highway 24.
45,3,"As they drove, another car began tailgating them.","During their journey, they noticed a vehicle closely following them."
45,4,"This car was weaving and at one point it stopped in the middle of the road, blocking all the cars that were behind it.","The pursuing vehicle was zigzagging and at one juncture halted abruptly on the road, causing a blockage for the trailing vehicles."
45,5,The original driver thought she had gotten away from the tailgater but he reappeared.,"The initial driver believed she had escaped the close follower, yet he surfaced again."
45,6,"She feared he was either drunk or having a heart attack and stopped her car, concerned.","Concerned that he might be intoxicated or suffering a medical emergency, she stopped her vehicle."
45,7,A police (sheriff) car was across the road.,"Across the street, there was a patrol car."
45,8,She approached asking for the sheriff's help.,She walked over to request assistance from the sheriff.
45,9,"He, in turn, went after the other car which backed away.","The sheriff responded by pursuing the erratic driver, who then retreated."

66,15,"This guy pulls into the lane,","This man drove into the lane,"
66,16,"and I thought, ""What a jerk...""","and I thought to myself, ""What an inconsiderate person..."""
66,17,but I sped up and got in front of him.,but I accelerated and maneuvered in front of him.
66,18,"He stayed put,","He remained stationary,"
66,19,"blocking Route 24,","obstructing Route 24,"
66,20,right in the middle of the road.,stationed right in the center of the roadway.
66,21,"Once the traffic cleared,","After the traffic had dissipated,"
66,22,we crossed over,we proceeded to cross over
66,23,"and continued toward the diamond,","and made our way towards the field,"
66,24,which is about a mile or two north of Route 24 on Aboite Center Road.,which lies a mile or two north of Route 24 on Aboite Center Road.
66,25,But this guy starts following us.,"Yet, this individual began to tail us."
66,26,"As we were heading up the slight hill by Ranch Eggs,","As we ascended the gentle incline near Ranch Eggs,"
66,27,he was tailing us closely.,he was following us at a close distance.
66,28,"Lisa was with me,","Lisa was accompanying me,"
66,29,"and she said, ""That guy is right on your bumper!""","and she remarked, ""That man is right on our tail!"""
66,30,"I checked the rearview mirror,","Glancing in the rearview mirror,"
66,31,"and sure enough, he was almost touching my car,","I confirmed he was nearly grazing our vehicle,"
66,32,so I kept an eye on him to make sure he didn’t hit us.,so I kept vigilant to ensure he didn't collide with us.
66,33,"He started swerving,","He began to veer from side to side,"
66,34,unable to stay in one lane.,struggling to maintain a single lane.
66,35,It was pretty alarming.,It was quite concerning.
66,36,"The whole time this was happening,","Throughout this ordeal,"
66,37,I kept thinking about how drunk driving is the leading cause of deaths for kids,my mind was preoccupied with the thought of how impaired driving is a major cause of youth fatalities
66,38,and how everyone has a responsibility to do something.,and the collective duty we all have to intervene.
66,39,I was pretty sure the guy was drunk—or at least acting like it—,I was fairly certain the man was intoxicated—or at least he seemed to be—
66,40,"so I decided that when we got to the stop sign,","so I resolved that upon reaching the stop sign,"
66,41,I was going to see what was going on.,I would investigate the situation.
66,42,"Maybe he was drunk,","Perhaps he was under the influence,"
66,43,"but then again,","or on the other hand,"
66,44,"what if he was sick, like having a heart attack or something?","what if he was experiencing a medical emergency, like a cardiac event?"
66,45,"I knew I had to act,","I felt compelled to take action,"
66,46,but I didn’t want to get involved if I didn’t have to.,yet I was reluctant to get involved unnecessarily.
66,47,"Still, I made up my mind.","Nevertheless, I made a decision."
66,48,"When we pulled up to the stop sign,","Upon arriving at the stop sign,"
66,49,there happened to be a sheriff’s car parked across the road.,"by chance, there was a sheriff's patrol car stationed across the street."
66,50,"I motioned for the officer to come over,","I gestured for the officer to approach,"
66,51,and they quickly drove across.,and they promptly crossed over.
66,52,"I got out of my car,","Exiting my vehicle,"
66,53,"walked over to the deputy,","I approached the deputy,"
66,54,"and said, ""The guy behind me is either sick or drunk, but he’s got a problem.","and explained, ""The individual behind us is either unwell or intoxicated, but he's definitely in trouble."
66,55,"He can't stay in his lane.""","He's unable to maintain his lane."""
66,56,"I told him, ""Something’s definitely wrong.""","I conveyed to them, ""There's certainly something amiss."""
66,57,So they headed toward the guy.,They then moved towards the man.
66,58,"As soon as he saw me get out and walk to the police car,","The moment he observed me step out and head towards the police car,"
66,59,"he stopped way back from the intersection,","he halted a good distance from the junction,"
66,60,"put his car in reverse,","shifted his vehicle into reverse,"
66,61,and started backing up.,and began to back away.
66,62,"When the cops went to check on him,","As the officers approached him,"
66,63,he kept backing down the road.,he continued reversing down the road.
66,64,"Eventually, they caught up,","Eventually, they caught up with him,"
66,65,and he started driving forward again.,and he resumed driving forward.
66,66,"The officers made a U-turn to follow him,","The police executed a U-turn to pursue him,"
66,67,and now he was driving real slow and carefully.,and he then proceeded to drive very slowly and cautiously.
66,68,"Ha ha, it was kind of funny...","Ha, it was somewhat amusing..."
66,69,I don’t know if they ever caught him.,I'm not sure if they ever apprehended him.

71,13,Couldn't keep it one lane.,He couldn't stick to his own lane.

71,16,"and find out what his problem is,","to inquire about his erratic behavior,"

73,7,and the guy didn't want to hear on the news,"and he dreaded hearing about it in the news,"
73,8,that he thought drunk guy was actually heart attack guy,"realizing the man he deemed inebriated might actually be a victim of a heart attack,"

74,2,"They were driving around,","They were cruising together,"

74,5,He was driving,He was maneuvering
74,6,the erratic probably drunk driver all over the road,the seemingly intoxicated driver erratically across the roadway

74,8,"He talked about, with some concern,","He expressed, with noticeable worry,"
74,9,that the driver was driving all the road dangerously,that the motorist was navigating the entire road hazardously

74,11,Lisa was able to see the driver as well in the car.,Lisa also managed to observe the driver from within their vehicle.
74,12,Also I think that the police were involved,"Additionally, I believe the authorities were called into action"

74,14,He may have talked also to the guy,He might have also engaged in conversation with the man
74,15,describing his personal driving story.,sharing his own experiences with driving.
74,16,The person describing the story in the end,The individual recounting the tale ultimately
74,17,seemed that he thought the incident,appeared to think that the event

75,4,swirling all over the road,"zigzagging erratically across the pavement,"
75,5,and he couldn't keep the car straight.,unable to maintain control of his vehicle.
75,6,"While all this is happening,","Amidst these events unfolding,"
75,7,our lady driver (I can't recall her name) starts to think to herself,"the female driver (whose name escapes me) starts pondering to herself,"
75,8,"that this man must be drunk or sick,","concluding that the individual might be intoxicated or unwell,"
75,9,and she thinks about how drunk driving is the number one cause of deaths on the road.,and she reflects on the fact that intoxicated driving leads as the top cause of fatalities on the streets.
75,10,She also thinks to herself,"She further contemplates,"
75,11,that if the man is having a heart attack,"considering the possibility that the man is suffering a cardiac event,"
75,12,then she will feel bad for calling him a drunk.,she would regret misjudging him as inebriated.
75,13,"Deciding to take action and find out what the man's problem is,","Resolved to act and ascertain the man's issue,"
75,14,she spotted the sheriff's car,"she caught sight of the patrol car,"
75,15,and decided to get them involved.,and resolved to involve the authorities.
75,16,The man had something to hide,"The man evidently had secrets to conceal,"
75,17,because he made a ridiculous attempt to get away from the police.,evidenced by his desperate attempt to elude the cops.
75,18,We do not know if he was caught or not in the end.,It remains unclear whether he was ultimately apprehended.

76,4,He appeared to be driving erratically,His driving seemed erratic
76,5,which made them (the narrator and Lisa) think that the driver was either sick or drunk.,leading them (the storyteller and Lisa) to suspect the motorist was ill or intoxicated.
76,6,"Concerned about the safety of others, particularly children,","Worried for the well-being of everyone, especially kids,"
76,7,they stopped at an intersection,they pulled over at a crossroads
76,8,and beckoned over a sheriff to check on the driver.,and signaled for a deputy to inspect the motorist.
76,9,"When the sheriff approached the vehicle,","As the deputy made his way to the car,"
76,10,"the drive first began to reverse away,","the driver initially started backing up,"
76,11,"and when caught,","then upon being cornered,"

78,2,and saw a guy following her,and noticed a man trailing behind her
78,3,[she] was not sure if he was drunk or sick,unsure whether he was inebriated or unwell
78,4,and she made up her mind to approach him,so she decided to confront him

78,6,"and just as she was about to do that,","and just as she was preparing to do so,"
78,7,a sheriff's car stopped the guy,a patrol car intercepted the man
78,8,and she told the sheriff to check on the guy,and she requested the officer to check on the man
78,9,if he's sick or drunk,to determine if he was ill or intoxicated
78,10,and she was scared,and she felt frightened
78,11,in case he's sick,worried he might be ill
78,12,and having a heart attack,possibly suffering from a cardiac arrest
78,13,and dies,and perish
78,14,"if she can hear this the following day about it,","fearing that if she hears about this incident the next day,"
78,15,then she would really feel bad,then she would be filled with regret
78,16,knowing she could have done something about [it].,aware that she might have been able to help.
79,1,"Driving in the car up to play softball up twenty four,","Cruising in my vehicle, heading to a softball game on route twenty-four,"

79,4,"then he basically blocks all of the intersection with his car,","eventually he obstructed the entire crossroads with his vehicle,"
79,5,so I managed to get in front of him.,yet I succeeded in maneuvering ahead of him.
79,6,"Driving up twenty four,","As I continued along twenty-four,"
79,7,I can see him in the mirror swerving from side to side,"I noticed him in my rearview mirror, zigzagging erratically"
79,8,not being able to stay in the right lane.,and failing to maintain his position in the correct lane.
79,9,I keep looking back,"I kept glancing rearward,"
79,10,thinking that drunk drivers are the number one killers.,pondering the fact that intoxicated drivers are the top cause of fatalities.
79,11,Then I start to question if he’s drunk or poorly?,I then began to wonder whether he was inebriated or unwell?
79,12,Maybe sick?,Possibly ill?
79,13,"While driving and keeping an eye on the guy in the back,","While operating the car and monitoring the individual behind me,"
79,14,how am I going to stop him.,I contemplated how to intervene.
79,15,When I get to the next Stop sign,"Upon approaching the upcoming stop sign,"
79,16,I’m going to get out and see if he’s okay.,my plan was to disembark and check on his condition.
79,17,When I reach the stop sign,"Arriving at the stop sign,"
79,18,I see a police car,I spotted a patrol car
79,19,I ask them over and tell them about he guy behind,"and approached them to report the erratic driver behind me,"

79,21,the cop walks to his car,"the officer proceeded towards his vehicle,"
79,22,and he puts it in reverse back down the hill.,and the man began reversing down the slope.
79,23,the cops are after him,"the police pursued him,"
79,24,"I’m not sure if they caught him,","I remained unsure about whether they apprehended him,"

81,5,and blocked the highway,effectively obstructing the freeway
81,6,(I think it was 24),(I believe it was Interstate 24)
81,7,and meant that they couldn’t get around him.,which made it impossible for them to bypass him.
81,8,He continued driving erratically,His erratic driving persisted
81,9,and he was worried about the car crashing into him,and there was concern about being rear-ended by his car
81,10,and causing an accident.,potentially leading to a collision.
81,11,He was initially convinced that he was drunk,The initial thought was that he might be intoxicated

81,15,and explained the situation.,where they relayed what was happening.

81,20,before he continued driving slowly,before he resumed his journey at a reduced speed
81,21,and carefully.,proceeding with caution.
82,1,my laptop froze,My computer crashed.
83,1,We were going to a church league soft ball game,Our destination was a church league softball match
83,2,scheduled at Homestead High School.,set to take place at Homestead High School.
83,3,You know where that is?,Are you familiar with that location?
83,4,"We are going to Twenty Four,","Our journey took us to Twenty Four,"
83,5,and also going at Ranch eggs getting ready.,where we were also preparing Ranch eggs.
83,6,There is this guy seated on the right.,There was a man sitting to our right.
83,7,"On the median, the guy starts.",The man began on the center divider.
83,8,So we went across,"Thus, we crossed over"
83,9,as soon as traffic cleared,waiting until the road was clear of traffic
83,10,we headed towards diamond.,and then we made our way to the playing field.
83,11,The guy kept following us.,The man continued to trail behind us.
83,12,I was with Lisa,I was accompanied by Lisa
83,13,"and she said ""that guy is on your tail.""","who remarked, ""That man is right behind you."""
83,14,I looked in the mirror.,"Glancing in the rearview mirror,"
83,15,The guy seemed like he was drunk,It appeared the man might be intoxicated
83,16,but he was having a heart attack.,"however, he was actually suffering from a heart attack."
84,1,He was on his way to Homestead,He was en route to Homestead
84,2,to play ball,for a game of ball
84,3,He went up Highway 24,Traveling along Highway 24
84,4,Another car was merging on to the highway,A different vehicle was entering the highway
84,5,and slowed down,causing him to reduce speed
84,6,He managed to get ahead of the car,He succeeded in overtaking the vehicle
84,7,but the car stayed in the middle of the highway,yet the vehicle remained in the center of the highway
84,8,slowing down the traffic,resulting in a slowdown of traffic
84,9,Then the slowed car sped up,"Subsequently, the lagging car accelerated"
84,10,and he was on its tail,and he found himself right behind it
84,11,His passenger was named Lisa,His companion was called Lisa
84,12,and mentioned that the car was on his tail,who pointed out that the vehicle was close behind them
84,13,He continued on Highway 24,He pressed on along Highway 24
84,14,towards the field,heading for the playing field
85,1,A lady who went for a game,A woman who set out for a sporting event
85,2,observed that she's being followed,noticed she was being trailed
85,3,by a man,by an individual
85,4,who she assumed is either sick or drunk.,whom she suspected was either ill or inebriated.
85,5,With her ongoing thought about causes of road accident,Contemplating the causes of vehicular accidents
85,6,and negative happenings on the road,and adverse incidents on the streets
85,7,she was worried,she felt apprehensive
85,8,and concerned about the man's driving attitude.,and was perturbed by the individual's driving behavior.
85,9,She explained to the local sheriff about this happening,She reported the incident to the local law enforcement
85,10,when she got her chance,at her earliest opportunity
85,11,then the man/driver desist,"subsequently, the man behind the wheel ceased"
85,12,and take off,and sped away
85,13,leading to a chase.,initiating a pursuit.
86,1,Somebody was driving to a church league softball game,An individual was en route to a church league baseball match
86,2,where they had to turn onto the 24,where they needed to make a turn onto highway 24
86,3,They went to pull out,They attempted to merge into traffic
86,4,but another car did at the same time,simultaneously as another vehicle did
86,5,He beat them to the spot in traffic,He managed to secure a place in the flow of vehicles first
86,6,and the other car was blocking the road,while the other vehicle obstructed the pathway
86,7,He then carries on driving,He proceeded to continue his drive
86,8,"and the car follows him, very close",with the other vehicle tailgating him closely
86,9,Then he decides to stop,"Subsequently, he opts to halt"
86,10,and see what his deal was,to understand the reason behind the other driver's actions
86,11,in case he was drunk or sick,wondering if the driver was intoxicated or unwell
86,12,He beckons a sheriff over at the stop sign,He signals to a deputy at the stop sign
86,13,and the car reverse down the road,and the other vehicle backs up on the road
86,14,before going forward,prior to accelerating forward
86,15,when the sheriff caught them,at the moment the deputy intercepted them
86,16,We don't know if they got pulled over.,It remains unclear whether they were stopped by the police.
87,1,A guy and his friend Lisa are going to a softball game at the diamond.,A man and his companion Lisa are heading to a softball match at the field.
87,2,"Whilst driving there, a gentleman from the side road tries to jump in by pulling out.","While en route, a man from an adjacent street attempts to merge abruptly."
87,3,But their car goes ahead filling the gap.,"However, their vehicle advances, occupying the space."
87,4,Meaning the other guy's car is blocking opposing traffic on the 29th street.,"As a result, the man's vehicle ends up obstructing the flow of oncoming traffic on 29th street."
87,5,This guy then proceeds to follow their car very closely.,"Subsequently, this individual starts tailgating their car at a very close distance."
87,6,And is bumper to bumper with them.,And remains only inches away from their rear bumper.
87,7,They notice he is also swerving between lanes.,They observe him zigzagging across multiple lanes.
87,8,They consider the idea he is possibly drunk.,They entertain the possibility that he might be intoxicated.
87,9,The driver thinks of the amount of teenagers that die due to drink driving.,The driver reflects on the number of young people who perish in alcohol-related driving incidents.
87,10,And also considers the driver may be having a medical issue.,And also ponders whether the driver could be experiencing a health emergency.
87,11,They decide at the next stop sign they will stop and see what the guy's issue is.,They resolve to pull over at the upcoming stop sign to ascertain the man's condition.
87,12,As he would feel bad if tomorrow he found out the guy passed due a medical issue.,Since they would regret it if they learned the next day that the man had succumbed to a health problem.
87,13,And they could have checked and helped.,And they had the opportunity to intervene and offer assistance.
87,14,They find a sheriff's car parked opposite the road when they stop.,"Upon stopping, they spot a patrol car on the opposite side of the street."
87,15,And so they approach the sheriff.,"Thus, they make their way toward the deputy."
87,16,And inform them of the driver's driving.,And they report the erratic behavior of the driver.
87,17,And that they believe he may be having a medical issue or may be drunk.,Expressing their concern that he might be inebriated or suffering from a medical issue.
87,18,The second driver (the one who may be drunk) hasn't reached the same point as their car.,The other driver (the one suspected of intoxication) hasn't arrived at their location yet.
87,19,But sees them talking to the police.,"However, he notices them conversing with law enforcement."
87,20,And starts to reverse back down the road.,And begins to back up along the street.
87,21,The police car follows down.,The squad car sets off in pursuit.
87,22,And follows the car which has now slowed down.,"And tails the vehicle, which has now decelerated."
87,23,And is driving at a suitable speed and in a sensible manner.,And is now traveling at a reasonable pace and in a controlled fashion.
88,1,"A man is driving down 24,","An individual is navigating Route 24,"
88,2,"headed to a ball game,","en route to a baseball match,"
88,3,past an egg place.,passing by a poultry farm.
88,4,He has a passenger named Lisa with him.,He is accompanied by a companion named Lisa.
88,5,A driver in another vehicle is blocking traffic.,Another motorist is causing a hold-up in the flow of traffic.
88,6,The first vehicle passes him.,The leading car overtakes him.
88,7,"Then, the second driver approaches from behind at a fast pace.","Subsequently, the obstructive driver rapidly catches up from the rear."
88,8,He is swerving back and forth.,This driver is zigzagging across lanes.
88,9,The first driver decides he is going to stop at a stop sign,The leading motorist resolves to halt at a stop sign
88,10,and approach the other driver to find out what his problem is.,and confront the other motorist to inquire about the issue.
88,11,He suspects either drunk driving or a medical problem.,He considers the possibility of impaired driving or a health emergency.
88,12,"Just then, a sheriff stops across the road.","At that moment, a sheriff's vehicle halts on the opposite side of the street."
88,13,The driver in the first vehicle approaches the sheriff,The motorist from the first car approaches the law officer
88,14,and explains the situation.,and recounts the erratic behavior witnessed.
88,15,"The sheriff then starts following the vehicle,","The law enforcement officer then begins to tail the problematic vehicle,"
88,16,which initially was going in reverse.,which was initially moving in reverse.
88,17,The vehicle then started going forward,"The vehicle then shifts to drive forward,"
88,18,and the sheriff made a U-turn,prompting the sheriff to execute a U-turn
88,19,and continued pursuing the vehicle.,and resume the chase.
88,20,The man lost track of the pursuit after that.,"Beyond that point, the man loses sight of the chase."
89,1,About a month ago we were going to a church softball game.,"Roughly four weeks prior, we were en route to a church baseball match."
89,2,There's a driver blocking the intersection.,A motorist was obstructing the crossroads.
89,3,"This whole time I'm thinking,","All the while, it crossed my mind,"
89,4,drunk driving is the number one killer of children.,intoxicated driving ranks as the top cause of fatalities among youth.
89,5,I saw the sheriff and told a deputy that the guy behind me is either sick or drunk but he has a problem.,"I spotted the sheriff and informed an officer that the individual trailing me was either unwell or inebriated, but definitely facing some issue."
89,6,He can't keep his car in the lane.,His vehicle was swerving and unable to stay within the lane.
89,7,The deputy starts driving towards the man,The officer began to approach the suspect's vehicle
89,8,and the driver starts driving backwards down the hill.,while the motorist began to reverse down the incline.
89,9,"When the deputy gets near him, the driver starts going forward slowly.","As the officer drew closer, the motorist proceeded to inch forward at a slow pace."
89,10,"HAHA, it's pretty comical.","HAHA, the situation was quite amusing."
89,11,I don't know if they ever stopped him or not.,I'm uncertain if they managed to pull him over eventually or not.
90,1,We were driving,Our journey was underway
90,2,to a little league baseball game,heading to a youth baseball match
90,3,at Homestead High,at Homestead High School
90,4,on the 24 highway.,via route 24.
90,5,I was expecting,My anticipation grew
90,6,to turn at Ranch Eggs.,as we approached the Ranch Eggs turnoff.
90,7,I pulled to the median,I maneuvered into the median
90,8,to wait for my turn,anticipating my opportunity to cross
90,9,and just then,when suddenly
90,10,another guy in a car,a different motorist
90,11,wanted to turn as well.,also signaled his intent to turn.
90,12,There was no room for him,The median offered no space for him
90,13,on the median,to join me
90,14,so I took my chance,so seizing the moment
90,15,and made the turn,I executed the turn
90,16,ahead of him,before he could
90,17,onto Aboite Road.,onto Aboite Road.
90,18,"For some reason,","For reasons unknown,"
90,19,he followed me,he tailed me
90,20,"too closely,","uncomfortably close,"
90,21,weaving behind me,zigzagging behind
90,22,and staying close,and maintaining a tight distance
90,23,on my tail.,right on my bumper.
90,24,Even my wife Lisa,"Even Lisa, my wife"
90,25,commented on this.,remarked upon his behavior.
90,26,There was obviously something wrong,"Clearly, something was amiss"
90,27,with him.,with this individual.
90,28,"Maybe he was ill,","Perhaps he was unwell,"
90,29,or drunk,or under the influence
90,30,and he could be a danger,posing a potential threat
90,31,to other people.,to others on the road.
90,32,I made up my mind,I resolved
90,33,to stop at the next Stop intersection,to pull over at the upcoming stop sign
90,34,coming up,that was near
90,35,and get out of the car,and exit the vehicle
90,36,to try and discuss this,to address the issue
90,37,with him.,directly with him.
90,38,"When I stopped,","Upon stopping,"
90,39,I noticed a police car,I spotted a patrol car
90,40,"on the other side of the road,","across the street,"
90,41,and I motioned to them,and I gestured towards them
90,42,and expressed my concern.,voicing my worries.
90,43,"When the other driver saw the police,","Noticing the police presence,"
90,44,he started to back down,the other driver began retreating
90,45,the highway.,down the road.
90,46,"The police followed him,","The officers gave chase,"
90,47,saw him reverse again,observed his erratic reversal
90,48,and progress very slowly ahead again.,and his subsequent slow advance.
90,49,They followed him again,They pursued once more
90,50,and they all eventually disappeared.,and eventually all were out of sight.
90,51,I never found out,The outcome remained unknown to me
90,52,whether they caught up with him.,as to whether they apprehended him.
91,1,I was driving down the highway to Homestead.,I found myself cruising along the freeway towards Homestead.
91,2,"As I was driving down the highway,","While I was navigating the freeway,"
91,3,I was about to turn right onto Twenty Four.,I prepared to make a right-hand turn onto Route Twenty Four.
91,4,"When across from me, I saw a car with a man in his middle fifties.","That's when I noticed a vehicle opposite me, operated by a middle-aged man."
91,5,He was blocking the highway.,His car was obstructing the freeway.
91,6,Eventually he moved,"After a short while, he proceeded to move,"
91,7,and I was able to turn right onto Twenty Four.,which allowed me to complete my right turn onto Route Twenty Four.
91,8,"Lisa was in the car with me, in the backseat,","Lisa was accompanying me, seated in the rear of the vehicle,"
91,9,"and she said ""He's tailing you!""","and she exclaimed, ""He's following you!"""
91,10,"So I looked back,","Turning my head to look,"
91,11,"and sure enough, the man was behind me, bumper to bumper.","I confirmed that indeed, the man was trailing closely behind me."
91,12,"I kept driving,","I continued on my way,"
91,13,while looking back to make sure the man didn't slam into me.,constantly checking to ensure the man didn't collide with my car.
91,14,"The man was weaving left and right,","The man's vehicle swerved unpredictably from side to side,"
91,15,he couldn't stay in one direction.,unable to maintain a consistent course.
91,16,"So I thought, ""drunk driving is the number one killer of kids!""","This led me to consider, ""Drunk driving is the leading cause of death among children!"""
91,17,I thought that the man might be drunk.,It crossed my mind that the man could be intoxicated.
91,18,"I figured that when I reached the next stop sign,","I decided that upon reaching the upcoming stop sign,"
91,19,I would turn around and go back to see what that man's problem was.,I would make a U-turn to check on the man's condition.
91,20,Because I wasn't sure if he was drunk or just sick.,I was uncertain whether he was inebriated or possibly ill.
91,21,Maybe he was having a heart attack or something.,"He might have been experiencing a medical emergency, like a heart attack."
91,22,I would've felt really bad if I saw in the news that a man died of a heart attack while driving,I would have been filled with regret had I later learned that a man suffered a fatal heart attack while driving
91,23,and I didn't do anything to help even though I was there.,and I had failed to assist despite being present at the scene.
91,24,When I reached the intersection I saw a police car parked at the other side of the street.,"Upon arriving at the crossroads, I spotted a patrol car on the opposite side."
91,25,"I waved to the police car,","I gestured to the officer in the patrol car,"
91,26,and it drove over to me.,who then drove towards me.
91,27,"I told the deputy, ""There's a man driving behind me, I don't know what his deal is, but I think he might be drunk or sick or something.","I informed the officer, ""A man has been driving erratically behind me, and I'm concerned he may be under the influence or unwell."
91,28,"Because he can't stay in one direction, he keeps driving into the opposite lane.""","He's unable to maintain his lane, veering into oncoming traffic."""
91,29,The deputy went down the street to look for the man.,The officer departed to search for the erratic driver.
91,30,"When the man reached the intersection and saw me,","As the man approached the crossroads and noticed me,"
91,31,he stopped his car,he brought his vehicle to a halt
91,32,and then started going in reverse.,and then began to reverse.
91,33,"He began to drive forward again,","He resumed driving forward once more,"
91,34,with the police car following behind him.,now with the police vehicle in pursuit.
91,35,The man was driving slowly and carefully now.,"At this point, the man was operating his car slowly and with caution."
91,36,I'm not sure if the police car ever stopped him.,Whether the police eventually pulled him over remains unknown to me.
92,1,"Two persons were going to a church softball game,","A pair of individuals were en route to a church baseball match,"
92,2,the main character and Lisa.,the protagonist and Lisa.
92,3,On the way there a guy was blocking the freeway with their car.,"En route, a man obstructed the highway with his vehicle."
92,4,"Later another car was acting weird,","Subsequently, another vehicle exhibited erratic behavior,"
92,5,"not staying in lane,","failing to maintain its lane,"
92,6,and tailgating.,and following too closely.
92,7,The main character was suspecting that they are either drunk or having a heart attack.,The protagonist began to suspect they were either inebriated or suffering a medical emergency.
92,8,"So he stops to inform a sheriff about it,","Therefore, he decided to alert a nearby officer about the situation,"
92,9,but the car tailgating tries to avoid the cops.,yet the vehicle that was following closely attempted to elude the police.
93,1,I was on my way to a church league baseball game,En route to a church-sponsored baseball match
93,2,that was organized by a high school,which a high school had put together
93,3,at the diamond,located at the baseball field
93,4,and had to get on ranch eggs and the twenty four.,I needed to take the route including ranch eggs and highway twenty-four.
93,5,"I noticed a driver in the car behind me,","I observed the motorist in the vehicle trailing mine,"
93,6,"he was middle-aged around 50,","a man in his fifties, approximately middle-aged,"
93,7,and when I started driving he was behind me.,who maintained his position behind me as I drove.
93,8,I had Lisa in the car with me,Lisa accompanied me in the vehicle
93,9,and she said the man was right on my tail.,and she remarked that the gentleman was tailgating us closely.
93,10,He was driving really close behind me,His car was following mine at an uncomfortably short distance
93,11,and I thought that he might be drunk.,leading me to suspect he could be intoxicated.
93,12,I know drink driving is one of the biggest killers of kids,Aware that driving under the influence is a major cause of youth fatalities
93,13,and I knew I had to do something.,I realized action was necessary.
93,14,But then I started to wonder,"However, I began to consider"
93,15,"if maybe he wasn't drunk but sick,","the possibility that he wasn't inebriated but perhaps unwell,"
93,16,that he might have a heart attack or something,potentially on the verge of a cardiac event or similar crisis
93,17,and I'd see in the papers he'd died.,and I might later read about his demise in the news.
93,18,So I thought I had to do something.,"Convinced that I needed to intervene,"
93,19,I saw a patrol car,I spotted a police cruiser
93,20,and stopped;,and pulled over;
93,21,I went over to the police,I approached the officers
93,22,and voiced my concerns about the driver.,and expressed my worries regarding the motorist.
93,23,By this point the driver had stopped a way away,"By then, the driver had halted at a distance"
93,24,and then began reversing slowly.,and started to back up slowly.
93,25,The police started following him,The officers commenced pursuit
93,26,and he began to drive forward again,and he resumed driving forward
93,27,in a comical way.,in a manner that seemed rather humorous.
94,1,"About a month ago while going to a church league softball game,","Roughly a month prior, while en route to a church softball match,"
94,2,it was at Homestead High School up at twenty four.,the venue was Homestead High School on route twenty four.
94,3,"While trying to turn at Ranch Egg,","Attempting to navigate a turn at Ranch Egg,"
94,4,there was a guy sitting there.,a man was stationed there.
94,5,He's about his middle fifties,He appeared to be in his mid-fifties
94,6,and he blocks the lane.,and obstructed the traffic lane.
94,7,I thought you jerk,I labeled him inconsiderate in my mind
94,8,and he got twenty four blocked.,as he caused a jam on twenty four.
94,9,"While the traffic cleared about a mile or 2 north of twenty four,","As traffic started to dissipate about a mile or two north of twenty four,"
94,10,this guy is following us,this individual was tailing us
94,11,as we're going up this little hill,while we ascended a slight incline
94,12,and my friend Lisa said this guy is on your tail,and my companion Lisa remarked that this man was close behind us
94,13,and I looked in the mirror,so I glanced in the rearview mirror
94,14,and saw him,and noticed him
94,15,and he's following bumper to bumper,"as he pursued us closely, bumper to bumper"
94,16,and I make sure he doesn't hit me.,and I remained vigilant to avoid a collision.
94,17,He sways from one lane to the other,He veered between lanes
94,18,and I think of how drunk driving is the number one killer of kids.,and it made me reflect on how impaired driving is the leading cause of youth fatalities.
94,19,I tried to make up my mind on what to do.,I contemplated what action to take.
94,20,He appeared drunk.,He seemed inebriated.
94,21,"When I get to the stop sign,","Upon reaching the stop sign,"
94,22,I'll try to find out.,I planned to investigate further.
94,23,He may be drunk,He could be intoxicated
94,24,or having a heart attack.,or suffering from a medical emergency.
94,25,I knew I will feel bad,I was aware that I would regret it
94,26,if I saw the news that a man died in a heart attack,if later I learned that a man had succumbed to a heart attack
94,27,while I thought he was drunk.,while I had assumed he was under the influence.
94,28,We saw a deputy,We encountered a police officer
94,29,and I approached him,and I went up to him
94,30,and told him that driver is maybe drunk or sick.,informing him that the motorist might be either intoxicated or unwell.
94,31,"And when the man saw me walk up to the deputy,","Upon seeing me approach the officer,"
94,32,he reversed and went backwards,the man drove in reverse
94,33,and the deputy followed.,and the officer set off in pursuit.
94,34,Then he turned,"Subsequently, the man made a turn"
94,35,and the deputy did a U-turn.,and the officer executed a U-turn.
94,36,Then he started driving slowly.,"After that, he proceeded to drive at a reduced speed."
94,37,I don't know if he was caught,I'm uncertain if he was apprehended
94,38,but it was really comical to watch.,but observing the scene unfold was quite amusing.
95,1,About a month ago we were going to church game.,"Roughly thirty days prior, we set out for a church event."
95,2,They had the game scheduled for the diamond at Homestead high school.,The event was planned to take place on the baseball field at Homestead High School.
95,3,We went up twenty four,We proceeded along route twenty four
95,4,"and getting ready to turn at ranch eggs,","preparing to make a turn near the ranch eggs area,"
95,5,slowing down for signal,decelerating due to the traffic signal
95,6,"and this guy sitting on right coming to twenty four,","when a man on the right approached the intersection of twenty four,"
95,7,looking in middle fifties.,seemingly in his mid-fifties.
95,8,He blocked the lane,He obstructed the traffic lane
95,9,and heading for the spot I'm going.,and aimed for the direction I was headed.
95,10,You know how you sit waiting for traffic to get by.,You're familiar with the situation where you wait for the passing vehicles.
95,11,The guy starts pulling out in the lane,The man began to edge into the traffic lane
95,12,"and I thought ""you jerk""","and I thought to myself, ""What a fool"""
95,13,but I hurried and got ahead of him.,yet I quickly maneuvered to pass him.
95,14,The guy sits in the middle of the highway blocked.,"The man remained stationary in the middle of the road, causing obstruction."
95,15,We went down soon,We continued on shortly after
95,16,the traffic cleared,as the traffic began to disperse
95,17,heading towards the diamond about two miles north of twenty four,making our way to the baseball field located about two miles north of route twenty four
95,18,and the guy is following us up the hill at ranch eggs.,with the man trailing us up the incline near ranch eggs.
95,19,Lisa said the guy is right on my tail.,Lisa remarked that the man was extremely close behind us.
95,20,I looked in the side mirror,Glancing at the side mirror
95,21,and the guy was there bumper to bumper,"I saw the man was tailgating us, barely a space between our bumpers"
95,22,and I tried to keep an eye on him making sure he doesn't slam on me.,and I remained vigilant to ensure he didn't collide into us.
95,23,He waves back and forth unable to keep in one lane.,"He swerved erratically, struggling to stay within a single lane."
95,24,All this time I think how drunk driving is the number one killer of people,"Throughout this ordeal, I was reminded that drunk driving is a leading cause of fatalities"
95,25,"and how it's everybody's responsibility,","and that preventing it is a collective duty,"
95,26,trying to make up my mind on what to do.,pondering over the course of action to take.
95,27,I was sure he was drunk on how he appeared,I was convinced of his intoxication based on his behavior
95,28,and figured when we get to stop sigh,and decided that once we reached the stop sign
95,29,I'm going back and find out his problem because I think he was drunk,"I would go back to confront him about his condition, suspecting he was inebriated"
95,30,and I had to do something.,and felt compelled to intervene.
95,31,Or maybe he has heart attack you have to do something.,"Alternatively, he might be suffering a medical emergency, which required immediate action."
95,32,It'd be bad if I see in the papers of the guy died of heart attack.,It would be tragic to later read in the newspaper that the man had succumbed to a heart attack.
95,33,I had made up my mind,Having resolved to act
95,34,so I pulled at the sign,I stopped at the sign
95,35,I walked and reported him.,and proceeded to inform the authorities.
95,36,After he saw me going to the police he throws his car,"Upon noticing my approach to the police, he hastily abandoned his vehicle"
95,37,and runs away.,and fled the scene.
95,38,The police start chasing him.,The police initiated a pursuit.

96,2,"On the way there,","During their journey,"
96,3,"they notice a car blocking the highway,","they spot a vehicle obstructing the road,"
96,4,so they take a detour.,prompting them to choose an alternate route.
96,5,"Suddenly an erratic driver begins following them,","Out of nowhere, a reckless motorist starts to pursue them,"
96,6,tailgating very closely.,following extremely close behind.
96,7,"This makes the driver nervous,","This causes the individual to feel anxious,"
96,8,so they pull over.,leading them to stop at the side of the road.
96,9,Once pulled over the other driver does as well further back.,"After stopping, the other motorist also stops, keeping a distance."
96,10,"A sheriff car is nearby,","A patrol car is in the vicinity,"
96,11,so the driver flags them down,prompting the individual to signal for their attention
96,12,"and tells them about the erratic driver,","and inform them about the unpredictable driver,"
96,13,that they are possibly intoxicated or in need of medical assistance.,suggesting they might be under the influence or require medical help.
96,14,Suddenly the erratic driver shifts it in reverse,"All of a sudden, the unpredictable driver goes into reverse"
96,15,and takes off.,and speeds away.

97,1,"I [was] heading to church to [the] softball game,","I was en route to the church's softball match,"
97,2,"as they have them all arranged,","since they had scheduled them all,"
97,3,"and [I] was driving down the twenty-four,","driving along Route 24,"
97,4,"when a male in his mid-50's pulls onto the highway,","when a man in his fifties merged onto the freeway,"
97,5,"[and] we were stuck for a second whilst traffic cleared,","and we momentarily halted as we waited for traffic to disperse,"
97,6,"but when it did,","but once it did,"
97,7,"I pulled off into the right lane,","I shifted into the right-hand lane,"
97,8,"[and] the man followed me,","and the gentleman tailed me,"
97,9,"and he got really close to my bumper,","coming dangerously near to my rear bumper,"
97,10,"and Lisa said how close he was to the bumper,","with Lisa commenting on his proximity to our bumper,"
97,11,"I thought he was drunk because he couldn't keep his car straight,","I suspected he was intoxicated due to his erratic steering,"
97,12,"[and] he was weaving and really close,","as he zigzagged and maintained a tight distance,"
97,13,"then there was a stop sign coming up,","then we neared a stop sign,"
97,14,"and I thought I will get out at the stop sign,","and I decided to pull over at the stop sign,"
97,15,"and go and check on him,","to check on his condition,"
97,16,"because even though I think he's drunk,","despite my suspicion of his intoxication,"
97,17,"and drink driving is the biggest killer,","aware that drunk driving is a major cause of fatalities,"
97,18,"I also thought he may be sick,","I also considered the possibility of illness,"
97,19,"and I didn't want to read about a man having a heart attack in his car,","not wanting to hear about a man suffering a cardiac event in his vehicle,"
97,20,and not have done anything.,without having attempted to assist.
97,21,"When we approached the stop sign,","As we arrived at the stop sign,"
97,22,"I saw a police car,","I noticed a patrol car,"
97,23,"and waved the deputy over,","signaled for the officer's attention,"
97,24,"I got out [of] my car,","exited my vehicle,"
97,25,"and approached the police,","approached the officers,"
97,26,"and told them he was weaving around,","and reported his erratic driving,"
97,27,"and he's probably drunk,","suggesting he might be under the influence,"
97,28,"and when they went to approach him,","and as they moved toward him,"
97,29,"he started reversing back down the hill,","he began to reverse down the incline,"
97,30,"and the police followed him,","with the officers in pursuit,"
97,31,"and when they caught up,","and upon catching up to him,"
97,32,"he started driving forward real slow,","he proceeded to drive forward at a slow pace,"
97,33,"and sensible,","in a controlled manner,"
97,34,"and they followed,","with the police in tow,"
97,35,[and] I wonder if they caught up with him.,leaving me to ponder whether they eventually apprehended him.
98,1,"About a month ago, see, we were going to a church league.","Roughly four weeks back, you know, we were en route to a church tournament."
98,2,We had scheduled for high school.,It was planned for the high school period.
98,3,"And I was slowing down to turn, signal.","I was decelerating to make a turn, indicating."
98,4,There's this guy to the right.,There was this fellow on my right.
98,5,Looked like he's about middle fifties.,Seemed to be in his mid-fifties.
98,6,And head heading for the same spot.,And he was aiming for the same location.
98,7,I'm going right there in the median.,I intended to go right there into the median.
98,8,But I hurried up and got there ahead of him.,Yet I managed to reach it before he did.
98,9,Sitting there right in the middle of the highway.,Stationed right there in the center of the road.
98,10,"North of twenty-four, about centre at Ranch.","Just north of Route twenty-four, near the center at Ranch."
98,11,Eggs were going up this hill.,We were ascending this incline.
98,12,And this guy's on my tail.,And this man was right on my bumper.
98,13,I looked in the mirror.,I glanced at the rearview mirror.
98,14,"And sure enough, he's right up it.","And indeed, he was tailgating closely."
98,15,Make sure he doesn't slam into me or anything.,Ensuring he doesn't crash into me or something similar.
98,16,I'm thinking how drunk driving is the number one killer of kids.,I was contemplating how impaired driving is the top cause of youth fatalities.
98,17,So I was trying to make my mind up what to do.,"Thus, I was deliberating on what action to take."
98,18,"So I figured when we get up to this stop sign, I'll ask him what his problem.","So I decided that once we reached the stop sign, I'd confront him about his issue."
98,19,Like maybe he's having a heart attack or something.,Wondering if perhaps he was suffering a cardiac event or the like.
98,20,Some guy died with a heart attack.,A man had passed away from a heart attack.
98,21,And there I was thinking he was drunk.,"And here I was, suspecting he was intoxicated."
98,22,But I had made up my mind that I was going to.,But I had resolved that I was going to take action.
98,23,So we pulled up at the stop sign.,"Eventually, we arrived at the stop sign."
98,24,And seen the sheriff.,And spotted the sheriff.
98,25,So I told him this guy behind me can't keep his car on the road.,So I informed him that the man tailing me couldn't keep his vehicle steady on the road.
98,26,His got a problem.,He was clearly troubled.
98,27,"And as soon as he sees me call the sheriff, he drives off.","And the moment he noticed me contacting the sheriff, he sped away."
98,28,When the cops went down there to check him out.,When the police pursued him to investigate.
98,29,He starts backing up.,He began to reverse.
98,30,Going backwards down the road.,Retreating backwards along the street.
98,31,And then starts forward again.,Then he proceeded forward once more.
98,32,And just driving real slow.,And was driving at a very slow pace.
98,33,I don't know if they ever stopped him or not.,I'm uncertain if they ever apprehended him or not.
99,1,I was driving towards the church softball tournament with Lisa,"En route to the church's softball competition, I was accompanied by Lisa in the car"
99,2,and we were driving along 24,as we made our way down highway 24
99,3,"when I saw this guy trying to pull out on me,",when suddenly I noticed a man attempting to merge into my lane
99,4,well I wasn’t having that,but I was determined not to let him cut in
99,5,so I accelerated,thus I sped up
99,6,and managed to get in front of this guy,and succeeded in positioning my car ahead of the man
99,7,who was now partially blocking the street.,who was by then obstructing part of the roadway
99,8,I carried on my way along 24,Continuing my journey on route 24
99,9,when I noticed this guy was now following me,I became aware that the man had started tailing me
99,10,only he was weaving from lane to lane,except he was zigzagging across lanes
99,11,and driving very erratically.,and his driving was highly unpredictable
99,12,He got me worried now,This situation began to unsettle me
99,13,and I commented on this to Lisa,which I mentioned to Lisa
99,14,and figured the guy could be drunk,and I surmised that the individual might be intoxicated
99,15,and that’s pretty dangerous,which is incredibly risky
99,16,as the main cause of deaths among kids is drunk drivers.,given that inebriated drivers are a leading cause of youth fatalities
99,17,I saw a stop sign up ahead,Approaching a stop sign further down the road
99,18,and thought to myself,I pondered to myself
99,19,I’m going to stop here,that I would come to a halt here
99,20,and see what’s going on with this guy.,to figure out what was happening with this individual
99,21,My first thought was that he was drunk,"Initially, I suspected he was under the influence"
99,22,but he could be having a heart attack,but it crossed my mind he might be suffering a cardiac event
99,23,or be really sick,or be severely ill
99,24,and I’d feel pretty bad,and I would regret it deeply
99,25,if I didn’t check on this guy,if I failed to check on the man
99,26,and then read the news,only to later discover in the news
99,27,that a guy had collapsed,that a man had suffered a medical emergency
99,28,and died,and passed away
99,29,and I could have done something to help him.,when I might have been able to assist
99,30,So I stop at the stop sign,"Therefore, I halted at the stop sign"
99,31,and get out of my car,stepped out of my vehicle
99,32,and notice a sheriff’s vehicle on the other side of the intersection.,and observed a sheriff's car across the junction
99,33,I go over to the sheriff,I approached the officer
99,34,and explain the situation,described what had transpired
99,35,and tell him he needs to go,and urged him to take action
99,36,and check on the guy behind me,to attend to the peculiar man behind us
99,37,who is acting strange,who was behaving oddly
99,38,and is either drunk or sick.,and was possibly inebriated or unwell
99,39,Meanwhile the guy behind saw me going to talk to the cop,"In the meantime, the man in question noticed my interaction with the law enforcement officer"
99,40,and starts backing down the road,and began to reverse down the street
99,41,"away from the cop,",steering clear of the officer
99,42,the cop keeps heading toward him,The officer proceeded towards him
99,43,and the guy keeps backing,while the man continued to retreat
99,44,has car really slowly,moving his vehicle very slowly
99,45,and carefully away from the cop.,and with caution away from the officer
99,46,I never did find out what happened,The outcome of the incident remained unknown to me
99,47,and if the cop ever managed to catch up with him.,nor did I learn whether the officer was able to catch up to him
