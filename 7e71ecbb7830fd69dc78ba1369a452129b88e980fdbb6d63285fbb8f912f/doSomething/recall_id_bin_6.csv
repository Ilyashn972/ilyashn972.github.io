He was angry I did not let him into my lane so he blocked a lane and then proceeded to tailgate me for several miles. As we approached our destination I got to a stop sign and saw a police car. When I got out of my car to tell the police about his erratic driving the other driver backed up down the road. The police chased the other driver but I am not sure they ever caught up with him.

They then realised that this man was following them, and was almost touching their bumper just a mile or two away from Ranch Eggs. They spot a nearby sherif and tell them about this guy, how he has a problem and could be drunk. The guy sees them approach the sherif and backs up, reversing the car away and driving off. The sherif hops into their car and starts to chase after them. After the guy did previously speed away, they start to act normal and drive normally. They never found out if they pulled him over or not."

Driving up twenty four, I can see him in the mirror swerving from side to side not being able to stay in the right lane. I keep looking back thinking that drunk drivers are the number one killers. Then I start to question if he’s drunk or poorly? Maybe sick? While driving and keeping an eye on the guy in the back, how am I going to stop him. When I get to the next Stop sign I’m going to get out and see if he’s okay. When I reach the stop sign I see a police car I ask them over and tell them about he guy behind and don’t know if he’s drunk driver or sick, the cop walks to his car and he puts it in reverse back down the hill. the cops are after him I’m not sure if they caught him, I carried on my journey"

He also begins to weave around the road and I think at this point that he's probably drunk. I was about to dismiss them but then I think that maybe they're sick or having a heart attack. I'd to read the paper the next day and realize he died because he had a heart attack. As soon as we reach the next intersection at a stop sign I see a sheriff's car across the road and get out to tell them that I think the guy behind me is either drunk or sick as he was weaving all over the road while tailgating me. The sheriff starts walking to the car behind me and he slowly starts reversing back down the highway. The sheriff gets in their car and starts down the road, and the other driver put his car in drive and starts slowly moving forward.

Soon enough they're tailgating the speaker, almost bumper to bumper. They recall the number one cause of death in kids is drunk driving. The speaker is pretty sure he's drunk. Or otherwise very sick since he can't stay on one side of the road. They get off the twenty four And think that something should be done about that car, Since they would feel horrible if the other driver wasn't drunk but instead was having a heart attack or were ill And found out about them in the news the next day. Found a sheriff's car And told them about the encounter. The suspected drunk driver saw them get off and speak with the people in the sheriff's car And stopped far away. Then reversed And started to go backwards. They then started to go very slowly. Never found out if the sheriff's car caught up with them And never heard about it again."
