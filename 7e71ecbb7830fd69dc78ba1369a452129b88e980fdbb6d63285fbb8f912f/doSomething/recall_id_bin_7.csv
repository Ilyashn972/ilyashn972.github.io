I wasn't sure if the driver was drunk or sick, but I knew I had to do something. I spoke to the police who headed towards the other car which had stopped in the road. The other car noticed and started reversing before turning around and driving away slowly and carefully while being followed by the police. I don't know what became of that car, or its driver."

While all this is happening, our lady driver (I can't recall her name) starts to think to herself that this man must be drunk or sick, and she thinks about how drunk driving is the number one cause of deaths on the road. She also thinks to herself that if the man is having a heart attack then she will feel bad for calling him a drunk. Deciding to take action and find out what the man's problem is, she spotted the sheriff's car and decided to get them involved. The man had something to hide because he made a ridiculous attempt to get away from the police. We do not know if he was caught or not in the end."

I noticed a driver in the car behind me, he was middle-aged around 50, and when I started driving he was behind me. I had Lisa in the car with me and she said the man was right on my tail. He was driving really close behind me and I thought that he might be drunk. I know drink driving is one of the biggest killers of kids and I knew I had to do something. But then I started to wonder if maybe he wasn't drunk but sick, that he might have a heart attack or something and I'd see in the papers he'd died. So I thought I had to do something. I saw a patrol car and stopped; I went over to the police and voiced my concerns about the driver. By this point the driver had stopped a way away and then began reversing slowly. The police started following him and he began to drive forward again in a comical way."

While he's driving on road Twenty-Four, he meets another driver driving very dangerously. That driver is constantly moving between the lanes and following his car too closely. The guy isn't sure if the dangerous driver is drunk or sick, and if he is sick he would feel bad if something bad happened to him. So he goes to see the cops for help and they start chasing the dangerous driver. The person telling the story doesn't know if they ever caught him."

He appeared to be driving erratically which made them (the narrator and Lisa) think that the driver was either sick or drunk. Concerned about the safety of others, particularly children, they stopped at an intersection and beckoned over a sheriff to check on the driver. When the sheriff approached the vehicle, the drive first began to reverse away, and when caught, began to drive forward to evade the sheriffs."

Driving down a highway called Twenty-four, they noticed a man in his fifties blocking the lane as he attempted to turn. After passing him, they noticed he was following them too closely, swerving back and forth. They became concerned that he might be drunk. Getting nervous, they decided to call a passing sheriff's car as they approached a stop sign. They told him what was going on, showing further back down the road, where the man was driving recklessly. In an instant, the man spotted the deputies and backed down the road, making it a silly scene. The deputies chased after him but weren't quite sure if they had any cause to actually arrest him or find out what the problem was."

As I was driving down the highway, I was about to turn right onto Twenty Four. When across from me, I saw a car with a man in his middle fifties. He was blocking the highway. Eventually he moved and I was able to turn right onto Twenty Four. Lisa was in the car with me, in the backseat, and she said ""He's tailing you!"" So I looked back, and sure enough, the man was behind me, bumper to bumper. I kept driving, while looking back to make sure the man didn't slam into me. The man was weaving left and right, he couldn't stay in one direction. So I thought, ""drunk driving is the number one killer of kids!"" I thought that the man might be drunk. I figured that when I reached the next stop sign, I would turn around and go back to see what that man's problem was. Because I wasn't sure if he was drunk or just sick. Maybe he was having a heart attack or something. I would've felt really bad if I saw in the news that a man died of a heart attack while driving and I didn't do anything to help even though I was there. When I reached the intersection I saw a police car parked at the other side of the street. I waved to the police car, and it drove over to me. I told the deputy, ""There's a man driving behind me, I don't know what his deal is, but I think he might be drunk or sick or something. Because he can't stay in one direction, he keeps driving into the opposite lane."" The deputy went down the street to look for the man. When the man reached the intersection and saw me, he stopped his car and then started going in reverse. He began to drive forward again, with the police car following behind him. The man was driving slowly and carefully now. I'm not sure if the police car ever stopped him."

There's a guy waiting to pull out who wants to edge out. I sneak ahead of him at the intersection and head on up the hill. He pulls into the lane behind me and then is riding my tail. Lisa, who is in the car with me, says, ""he's right on your tail."" I think he might be drunk. He then starts weaving, and I'm not sure what's going on. I decided I'm going to stop and check it out at the next stop sign. We stop, there's a sheriff and I motion him over. [I] Say, ""this guy is drunk or sick."" The guy starts backing up, turns around and drives off slowly. The cops follow."
