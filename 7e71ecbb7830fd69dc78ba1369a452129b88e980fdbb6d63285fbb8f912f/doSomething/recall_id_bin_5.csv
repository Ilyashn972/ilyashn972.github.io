They recall that two months ago they were supposed to go and watch a softball game. As they are driving they realize that someone is driving suspiciously close to them. Lisa even said he was on their tail. He was very close such that it was bumper to bumper. They continued on the road and turned onto the road called twenty-four and the man followed them still. They realized that he was weaving and could not keep to one side of the road, he was not keeping to his lane. At this point they thought that he was either drunk or sick for example having a heart-attack. They called the cops on him and as he saw police approaching his car he had parked at a distance, he started driving in reverse. The cops started chasing him and this is where the story ends as the two ladies also never got to know if the police caught up with the driver."

On the way there, they notice a car blocking the highway, so they take a detour. Suddenly an erratic driver begins following them, tailgating very closely. This makes the driver nervous, so they pull over. Once pulled over the other driver does as well further back. A sheriff car is nearby, so the driver flags them down and tells them about the erratic driver, that they are possibly intoxicated or in need of medical assistance. Suddenly the erratic driver shifts it in reverse and takes off. The sheriff follows suit."

He stopped at a junction and blocked it. He could not seem to keep on one side of the road. I thought he must be drunk and wanted to get away from him, then I thought, what if he is sick? I would feel terrible to read in the newspaper tomorrow that he had died from a heart attack and I had done nothing about it. Just then I spotted a sheriff's car, so I went over to him and told him that the guy in the car down the road was either drunk or sick as he could not keep his car on one side of the road. As soon as the guy in the car saw me walking over to the sheriff's car he started reversing. The sheriff drove towards him. The guy started driving carefully. The sheriff followed him. I have no idea if they ever stopped him or not."

A guy blocked the highway and the narrator moved into the median before the guy. The guy then followed the narrator down the road to the diamond about a mile or two past Ranch Eggs. The guy was swerving and the narrator thought he was drunk or sick. Lisa pointed out the guy was really close. The narrator stopped at a stop sign and motioned the cops over.

When we approached the stop sign, I saw a police car, and waved the deputy over, I got out [of] my car, and approached the police, and told them he was weaving around, and he's probably drunk, and when they went to approach him, he started reversing back down the hill, and the police followed him, and when they caught up, he started driving forward real slow, and sensible, and they followed, [and] I wonder if they caught up with him."

They talk to about the other vehicle. It is being driven erratically. They mention that the driver might be drunk. The cops then chase the vehicle. It backs up in reverse.

A man in his mid fifties was pulling in from somewhere blocking the road with his car on the Twenty-Four when the driver in the car with Lisa drove in and overtook him. The man in his mid fifties began following their car bumper to bumper, swaying between the two lanes on the road. The driver and Lisa thought the man was either drunk, which led him to think about how drunk driving is a major killer of young people on the roads, or the man was either sick having a heart attack or something similar. The driver didn't want to somehow read the papers the next day and find out the mid fifties man had actually suffered a heart attack and died as a result, thinking he was actually just drunk driving. Soon they see a Sheriff nearby while driving and so he waves to the sheriff to get his attention and pull over and tells him about the mid fifties man following them and that he's either sick or drunk and to go check on him. As soon as the deputy approaches the mid fifties man's car he begins to put his car in reverse and go backwards as quickly as possible. The driver and Lisa appear humoured and not knowing whether the police had ever caught or reached the man in his fifties."

I decided that at the next intersection I am going to confront him, I mean what if he is drunk and major accidents are caused by drunk driving and he can't even keep to one lane. I didn't want to get involved but I have to, also what if he is having a heart attack, I don't want to read on the news that he died while I could have done something about it. At the next stop sight I jumped out and informed a sheriff about him, ""that man is either drunk or is having a health problem, he has been following me for a while now and he can't keep on his lane."" Seeing that I was talking to the police he stopped way far and started reversing and the police started chasing him."

The couple passed the car and the car followed them and tailgated them while swerving. The driver told his partner, Lisa, that he was going to stop at the stop sign up ahead and he was going to go back and approach the driver to see if he was either drunk or if he was sick (having a medical emergency). When the couple approached the stop sign they noticed a police officer and got out of their car to inform him of what had happened. The car behind them noticed this and stopped down the road. The police officer went down to speak to the driver but the driver started to reverse the car, until the police officer was able to catch up. Once the officer caught up the driver started driving forward again, really slow and really carefully in a very comical way."

He has a girl named Lisa in the car. Another man stops at the intersection and blocks off traffic. The main character goes past and the man follows. The driver behind them is driving weirdly so the main character assumes he is drunk. Then he assumes he is maybe sick and should check him out in case the newspaper says a man had a heart attack and the main character could've helped. The MC stops the car, spots a sheriffâ€™s car, and calls them over. He tells the deputy to check the other driver out. When the driver saw the MC talking to the police, he reversed, the police followed. Then he went forward and the police had to make a u-turn. The MC thought this was comical. He wasn't sure if the other driver was caught or not."
