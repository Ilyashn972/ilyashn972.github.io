And we were driving up 25th, and we come to an intersection where this guy is coming from 24th. And he tries to get in right in the median, where people turn from you know. And I think ""you jerk"" but I manage to get in front of him. Then we head up 25th, up the hill, by Egg Ranch. And this guy, looks to be middle fifties, is right on my tail. Lisa looked back there and said ""He's right on your tail!"" And sure enough, we're basically bumper to bumper. And he can't keep his truck straight, in and out of the lane. So I think he must be drunk. And all I can think is how drunk driving is the number one killer on the roads. And how it's everyone's responsibility. That or maybe he's having a medical problem, like a heart attack. I just know it would kill me if I read in the papers the next day about a guy dying from a heart attack on the road. He could be having a heart attack and here I am thinking he's drunk. So I feel like I have to do something. We're coming up to a stop sign and I decide that when I stop, I'm going to get out and go see what's going on. Either he's drunk or having a medical problem, and I decided I needed to help. I don't really want to get involved but I feel like I have to. So I stop at the stop sign. And across the intersection, a police car has pulled up. So I wave him over, and I get out of the car. And I tell the deputy that either this guy behind me is drunk or having a definite medical problem because he's swerving across the lanes. But the driver saw me get out and talk to the deputy, and now he's stopped way back, far back from my car. Ha ha. Then as the deputy is walking down there to talk to him, he starts backing up. And then he pulls a u turn, and the police car follows him. But he's going real slow and careful down the road. It was quite comical. I don't know if they ever managed to pull him over."

They were driving around, and I think they spotted a dangerous driver on the highway that they were driving on. He was driving the erratic probably drunk driver all over the road and in the median of the highway. He talked about, with some concern, that the driver was driving all the road dangerously and that is perhaps the number one killer of children. Lisa was able to see the driver as well in the car. Also I think that the police were involved and pulled over the driver. He may have talked also to the guy describing his personal driving story. The person describing the story in the end seemed that he thought the incident that he viewed passing old high school, and on to the highway viewing the dangerous driver he though was a bit funny and concerning. This is what I can recall."

They pass by a car that is stopped at an intersection at a stop sign on 24th street. A man around his 50s is driving the car. The man and woman pass the other driver and keep driving. The car then comes up behind them, and the woman tells the speaker that the other car is driving really close, bumper-to-bumper. Also, the other car is also swaying side to side, very dangerously. The speaker recalls thinking that the driver of the car behind them might be drunk, or maybe having a medical emergency. So the speaker decides to confront them the next time they come up to a stop sign. When they arrive at an intersection, the driver spots a police car on the other side of the road. The speaker gets out of the car and catches the police's attention and explains to them the reckless driving the other car is doing. The other car is suddenly going very slowly, and then starts reversing when the speaker is speaking to the police. The police then go back to their car and try to catch up to the reckless driver. The speaker doesn't know if the police ever caught the reckless driver or not."

They had the game scheduled for the diamond at Homestead high school. We went up twenty four and getting ready to turn at ranch eggs, slowing down for signal and this guy sitting on right coming to twenty four, looking in middle fifties. He blocked the lane and heading for the spot I'm going. You know how you sit waiting for traffic to get by. The guy starts pulling out in the lane and I thought ""you jerk"" but I hurried and got ahead of him. The guy sits in the middle of the highway blocked. We went down soon the traffic cleared heading towards the diamond about two miles north of twenty four and the guy is following us up the hill at ranch eggs. Lisa said the guy is right on my tail. I looked in the side mirror and the guy was there bumper to bumper and I tried to keep an eye on him making sure he doesn't slam on me. He waves back and forth unable to keep in one lane. All this time I think how drunk driving is the number one killer of people and how it's everybody's responsibility, trying to make up my mind on what to do. I was sure he was drunk on how he appeared and figured when we get to stop sigh I'm going back and find out his problem because I think he was drunk and I had to do something. Or maybe he has heart attack you have to do something. It'd be bad if I see in the papers of the guy died of heart attack. I had made up my mind so I pulled at the sign I walked and reported him. After he saw me going to the police he throws his car and runs away. The police start chasing him."

The games were all set to be played at the diamond at Homestead High School. Do you know where that is? Well, we were driving up Route 24, getting ready to turn near Ranch Eggs, and I was slowing down, signaling to turn. As I was slowing down, there was this guy sitting off to the right, getting ready to merge onto Route 24. He looked like he was in his mid-fifties. He starts inching out onto the road, partially blocking the lane, aiming for the same spot I was headed to. You know how you wait in the median for traffic to pass? This guy pulls into the lane, and I thought, ""What a jerk..."" but I sped up and got in front of him. He stayed put, blocking Route 24, right in the middle of the road. Once the traffic cleared, we crossed over and continued toward the diamond, which is about a mile or two north of Route 24 on Aboite Center Road. But this guy starts following us. As we were heading up the slight hill by Ranch Eggs, he was tailing us closely. Lisa was with me, and she said, ""That guy is right on your bumper!"" I checked the rearview mirror, and sure enough, he was almost touching my car, so I kept an eye on him to make sure he didn’t hit us. He started swerving, unable to stay in one lane. It was pretty alarming. The whole time this was happening, I kept thinking about how drunk driving is the leading cause of deaths for kids and how everyone has a responsibility to do something. I was pretty sure the guy was drunk—or at least acting like it— so I decided that when we got to the stop sign, I was going to see what was going on. Maybe he was drunk, but then again, what if he was sick, like having a heart attack or something? I knew I had to act, but I didn’t want to get involved if I didn’t have to. Still, I made up my mind. When we pulled up to the stop sign, there happened to be a sheriff’s car parked across the road. I motioned for the officer to come over, and they quickly drove across. I got out of my car, walked over to the deputy, and said, ""The guy behind me is either sick or drunk, but he’s got a problem. He can't stay in his lane."" I told him, ""Something’s definitely wrong."" So they headed toward the guy. As soon as he saw me get out and walk to the police car, he stopped way back from the intersection, put his car in reverse, and started backing up. When the cops went to check on him, he kept backing down the road. Eventually, they caught up, and he started driving forward again. The officers made a U-turn to follow him, and now he was driving real slow and carefully. Ha ha, it was kind of funny... I don’t know if they ever caught him."
