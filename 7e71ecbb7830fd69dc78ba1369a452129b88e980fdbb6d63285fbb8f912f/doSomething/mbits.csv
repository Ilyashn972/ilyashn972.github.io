They were driving up 22 and were about to make a turn near Egg Ranch (?) when a guy pulled across into the median and started blocking the 24. They noticed that the guy must have a problem. They first thought he must be drunk but then thought he might be sick - having a heart attack or something. They didn't want to read in the paper that a guy had died of a heart attack when they could have done something by checking so they decided they would check out what was happening even though they didn't want to get involved. They said to Lisa who was in the car that the guy behind them had some problem and couldn't stay on one side of the road. They made a decision to stop at the stop sign a mile or 2 down the road and get out the car and see what was happening in the car behind. When they got to the stop sign a police patrol car pulled up on the opposite side at the same time so they waved the Deputy over. They explained to the Deputy that the guy in the car behind seemed to either be drunk or sick as they were unable to keep their vehicle on one side of the road. When they got out the car to speak to the Deputy they noticed the other car had stopped a ways back and was now slowing reversing back down the road away from them.

When across from me, I saw a car with a man in his middle fifties. He was blocking the highway. Eventually he moved and I was able to turn right onto Twenty Four. Lisa was in the car with me, in the backseat, and she said ""He's tailing you!"" So I looked back, and sure enough, the man was behind me, bumper to bumper. I kept driving, while looking back to make sure the man didn't slam into me. The man was weaving left and right, he couldn't stay in one direction. So I thought, ""drunk driving is the number one killer of kids!"" I thought that the man might be drunk. I figured that when I reached the next stop sign, I would turn around and go back to see what that man's problem was. Because I wasn't sure if he was drunk or just sick. Maybe he was having a heart attack or something. I would've felt really bad if I saw in the news that a man died of a heart attack while driving and I didn't do anything to help even though I was there. When I reached the intersection I saw a police car parked at the other side of the street. I waved to the police car, and it drove over to me.

Because he can't stay in one direction, he keeps driving into the opposite lane."" The deputy went down the street to look for the man.

Part of me also didn't want to do anything but by then, I had already made up my mind to confront him. Then I saw a sheriff on the other side of the road, so I stopped and motioned for him to come over. I told the sheriff that the man behind me was driving erratically and couldn't stay on one side of the road, and that he was either drunk or having a heart attack, but was having some kind of problem. When I stopped to talk to the sheriff the driver of the vehicle stopped a ways down the road. Then when the sheriff drove after him, he started driving the road in reverse.

66,651.8,"About a month ago, we were heading to a church league softball game. The games were all set to be played at the diamond at Homestead High School. Do you know where that is? Well, we were driving up Route 24, getting ready to turn near Ranch Eggs, and I was slowing down, signaling to turn. As I was slowing down, there was this guy sitting off to the right, getting ready to merge onto Route 24. He looked like he was in his mid-fifties. He starts inching out onto the road, partially blocking the lane, aiming for the same spot I was headed to. You know how you wait in the median for traffic to pass? This guy pulls into the lane, and I thought, ""What a jerk..."" but I sped up and got in front of him. He stayed put, blocking Route 24, right in the middle of the road. Once the traffic cleared, we crossed over and continued toward the diamond, which is about a mile or two north of Route 24 on Aboite Center Road. But this guy starts following us. As we were heading up the slight hill by Ranch Eggs, he was tailing us closely. Lisa was with me, and she said, ""That guy is right on your bumper!"" I checked the rearview mirror, and sure enough, he was almost touching my car, so I kept an eye on him to make sure he didn’t hit us. He started swerving, unable to stay in one lane. It was pretty alarming. The whole time this was happening, I kept thinking about how drunk driving is the leading cause of deaths for kids and how everyone has a responsibility to do something. I was pretty sure the guy was drunk—or at least acting like it— so I decided that when we got to the stop sign, I was going to see what was going on. Maybe he was drunk, but then again, what if he was sick, like having a heart attack or something? I knew I had to act, but I didn’t want to get involved if I didn’t have to. Still, I made up my mind. When we pulled up to the stop sign, there happened to be a sheriff’s car parked across the road. I motioned for the officer to come over, and they quickly drove across. I got out of my car, walked over to the deputy, and said, ""The guy behind me is either sick or drunk, but he’s got a problem. He can't stay in his lane."" I told him, ""Something’s definitely wrong."" So they headed toward the guy. As soon as he saw me get out and walk to the police car, he stopped way back from the intersection, put his car in reverse, and started backing up. When the cops went to check on him, he kept backing down the road. Eventually, they caught up, and he started driving forward again. The officers made a U-turn to follow him, and now he was driving real slow and carefully. Ha ha, it was kind of funny... I don’t know if they ever caught him.",31.42,36.7,10.58,17.59,30.65,12.04,0.03,3.29,17.58,3.73,14.81,6.71,7.68,14.32,15.83,7.73,1.3,7.08,7.78,9.41,0.19,8.05,3.68,-0.39,14.37,6.67,23.1,3.63,13.92,7.9,-2.14,2.92,13.62,7.7,9.59,4.47,2.35,8.83,7.26,1.21,7.42,27.96,9.7,1.17,7.84,3.22,14.47,-2.32,0.75,13.98,4.41,-0.17,0.8,-2.09,-1.65,2.31,4.08,2.08,12.01,3.56,8.15,5.85,2.2,11.21,5.45,1.19,7.04,5.38,18.56,10.59,0.13,3.25,1.65,11.75,2.06,5.43,5.97,10.25,11.72,14.5,6.75
