They were driving up 22 and were about to make a turn near Egg Ranch (?) when a guy pulled across into the median and started blocking the 24. They noticed that the guy must have a problem. They first thought he must be drunk but then thought he might be sick - having a heart attack or something. They didn't want to read in the paper that a guy had died of a heart attack when they could have done something by checking so they decided they would check out what was happening even though they didn't want to get involved. They said to Lisa who was in the car that the guy behind them had some problem and couldn't stay on one side of the road. They made a decision to stop at the stop sign a mile or 2 down the road and get out the car and see what was happening in the car behind. When they got to the stop sign a police patrol car pulled up on the opposite side at the same time so they waved the Deputy over. They explained to the Deputy that the guy in the car behind seemed to either be drunk or sick as they were unable to keep their vehicle on one side of the road. When they got out the car to speak to the Deputy they noticed the other car had stopped a ways back and was now slowing reversing back down the road away from them.

At that moment, I noticed a sheriff on the opposite side of the street, so I halted and gestured for him to approach. I informed the sheriff that the man tailing me was driving unpredictably and was unable to adhere to a single lane, suggesting he was either intoxicated or suffering a medical crisis, but definitely experiencing some sort of issue. As I halted to speak with the sheriff the other driver came to a stop further down the road. The sheriff set off in pursuit as the motorist began to reverse along the road. Eventually, the driver executed a U-turn and commenced driving in the correct direction, with the sheriff in pursuit. His speed was notably reduced and the entire scene was quite amusing to observe. I remain uncertain whether the sheriff ultimately intercepted the vehicle's driver.",1777,0.07240955956471583

The guy who was blocking the lane starts following them and Lisa the friend said, ""This guy is on your tail."" He starts weaving back and forth and this lead him to thinking the guy could be a drunk driver and how it is the number 1 killer of kids and that it is everyone's responsibility to report drunk driving. Then he thinks maybe they were having a heart attack and that he would feel guilty if he read the paper and saw a man had died of a heart attack and then he motioned at the police to come towards him.

Exasperated, they exclaimed, 'You jerk!' and managed to overtake him. The man who had been blocking traffic began to tail them and Lisa, the companion, remarked, 'This guy is right on our bumper.' He began to zigzag across the road leading to the suspicion that he might be intoxicated and considering that drunk driving is the leading cause of youth fatalities and that reporting suspected drunk drivers is a collective duty. Then he wondered if perhaps they were suffering a medical emergency and he would be remorseful if he later read in the newspaper that a man had succumbed to a heart attack so he gestured for the police to approach.

18,"We were going to the baseball diamond, and the High School. And we were driving up 25th, and we come to an intersection where this guy is coming from 24th. And he tries to get in right in the median, where people turn from you know. And I think ""you jerk"" but I manage to get in front of him. Then we head up 25th, up the hill, by Egg Ranch. And this guy, looks to be middle fifties, is right on my tail. Lisa looked back there and said ""He's right on your tail!"" And sure enough, we're basically bumper to bumper. And he can't keep his truck straight, in and out of the lane. So I think he must be drunk. And all I can think is how drunk driving is the number one killer on the roads. And how it's everyone's responsibility. That or maybe he's having a medical problem, like a heart attack. I just know it would kill me if I read in the papers the next day about a guy dying from a heart attack on the road. He could be having a heart attack and here I am thinking he's drunk. So I feel like I have to do something. We're coming up to a stop sign and I decide that when I stop, I'm going to get out and go see what's going on. Either he's drunk or having a medical problem, and I decided I needed to help. I don't really want to get involved but I feel like I have to. So I stop at the stop sign. And across the intersection, a police car has pulled up. So I wave him over, and I get out of the car. And I tell the deputy that either this guy behind me is drunk or having a definite medical problem because he's swerving across the lanes. But the driver saw me get out and talk to the deputy, and now he's stopped way back, far back from my car. Ha ha. Then as the deputy is walking down there to talk to him, he starts backing up. And then he pulls a u turn, and the police car follows him. But he's going real slow and careful down the road. It was quite comical. I don't know if they ever managed to pull him over.",1918,0.12,"Our destination was the baseball field, along with the High School. We took our route along 25th street, approaching a crossroad where a man was arriving from 24th street. He attempted to merge abruptly into the median, the area designated for turning, as you might be aware. I thought to myself, ""What a nuisance"", yet I succeeded in maneuvering ahead of him. Continuing our journey on 25th street, we ascended the incline, passing by the Egg Ranch. This individual, appearing to be in his mid-fifties, was tailgating me closely. Lisa glanced rearward and exclaimed, ""He's tailgating you!"" Indeed, our vehicles were nearly touching, practically bumper to bumper. He struggled to maintain his truck in a straight line, veering from side to side within the lane. My suspicion was that he might be intoxicated. All that crossed my mind was the grim reality that drunk driving leads in road fatalities. And that it's a collective duty to prevent it. Alternatively, he could be experiencing a medical emergency, such as a cardiac arrest. The thought that I might discover in tomorrow's newspaper about someone succumbing to a heart attack on the road was unbearable. The possibility of him suffering a heart attack was there, and yet I suspected intoxication. I felt compelled to intervene in some way. As we neared a stop sign, I made up my mind that upon stopping, I would exit my vehicle and investigate the situation. Whether he was inebriated or in the midst of a health crisis, I resolved that I had to offer assistance. Involvement was not my preference, but it seemed like an obligation. Thus, I halted at the stop sign. Directly across the junction, a patrol car had arrived. I gestured for the officer to come over, and stepped out of my vehicle. I informed the officer that the man trailing me was either impaired by alcohol or experiencing a serious health issue given his erratic lane changes. Noticing me exit and converse with the officer, the driver halted at a considerable distance from my car. Quite amusing, indeed. As the officer began to approach him, he commenced reversing. Subsequently, he executed a U-turn, with the police vehicle in pursuit. Yet, he proceeded down the road with exaggerated caution and slowness. The situation was rather humorous. Whether they ultimately managed to stop him remains unknown to me.",2338,0.06936438619698886

We saw a deputy and I approached him and told him that driver is maybe drunk or sick. And when the man saw me walk up to the deputy, he reversed and went backwards and the deputy followed.
