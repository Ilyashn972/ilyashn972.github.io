1,"A man was in the car with a woman named Lisa, going to watch a softball game driving down the Twenty-Four. A man in his mid fifties was pulling in from somewhere blocking the road with his car on the Twenty-Four when the driver in the car with Lisa drove in and overtook him. The man in his mid fifties began following their car bumper to bumper, swaying between the two lanes on the road. The driver and Lisa thought the man was either drunk, which led him to think about how drunk driving is a major killer of young people on the roads, or the man was either sick having a heart attack or something similar. The driver didn't want to somehow read the papers the next day and find out the mid fifties man had actually suffered a heart attack and died as a result, thinking he was actually just drunk driving. Soon they see a Sheriff nearby while driving and so he waves to the sheriff to get his attention and pull over and tells him about the mid fifties man following them and that he's either sick or drunk and to go check on him. As soon as the deputy approaches the mid fifties man's car he begins to put his car in reverse and go backwards as quickly as possible. The driver and Lisa appear humoured and not knowing whether the police had ever caught or reached the man in his fifties.",1292,32,79.15,128.71

I was driving down Twenty-Four and was waiting to turn, but a car started going for the spot at the same time. I quickly drove past him and he just stayed stopped blocking the highway. Then the driver started following us. I was with my friend Lisa and she said the vehicle was right on my tail, like almost bumper to bumper. And he was driving all over the place and not staying in his lane. I thought for sure he was drunk, and that I should turn around and confront him. But then I thought that he could also have a medical problem, like maybe he was having a heart attack, and I didn't want to read the news the next day and see that someone died while having a heart attack and I could have done something to help them. Part of me also didn't want to do anything but by then, I had already made up my mind to confront him. Then I saw a sheriff on the other side of the road, so I stopped and motioned for him to come over. I told the sheriff that the man behind me was driving erratically and couldn't stay on one side of the road, and that he was either drunk or having a heart attack, but was having some kind of problem. When I stopped to talk to the sheriff the driver of the vehicle stopped a ways down the road. Then when the sheriff drove after him, he started driving the road in reverse. Then the driver turned the car around and started driving the right way, with the sheriff following. He was driving really slow and it was such a funny thing to witness. I'm not sure if the sheriff ever stopped the driver of the vehicle.",1630,34,171.19,189.87

And is bumper to bumper with them. They notice he is also swerving between lanes. They consider the idea he is possibly drunk. The driver thinks of the amount of teenagers that die due to drink driving. And also considers the driver may be having a medical issue. They decide at the next stop sign they will stop and see what the guy's issue is. As he would feel bad if tomorrow he found out the guy passed due a medical issue. And they could have checked and helped. They find a sheriff's car parked opposite the road when they stop. And so they approach the sheriff. And inform them of the driver's driving. And that they believe he may be having a medical issue or may be drunk. The second driver (the one who may be drunk) hasn't reached the same point as their car. But sees them talking to the police.

The deputy starts driving towards the man and the driver starts driving backwards down the hill. When the deputy gets near him, the driver starts going forward slowly. HAHA, it's pretty comical.

90,"We were driving to a little league baseball game at Homestead High on the 24 highway. I was expecting to turn at Ranch Eggs. I pulled to the median to wait for my turn and just then another guy in a car wanted to turn as well. There was no room for him on the median so I took my chance and made the turn ahead of him onto Aboite Road. For some reason, he followed me too closely, weaving behind me and staying close on my tail. Even my wife Lisa commented on this. There was obviously something wrong with him. Maybe he was ill, or drunk and he could be a danger to other people. I made up my mind to stop at the next Stop intersection coming up and get out of the car to try and discuss this with him. When I stopped, I noticed a police car on the other side of the road, and I motioned to them and expressed my concern. When the other driver saw the police, he started to back down the highway. The police followed him, saw him reverse again and progress very slowly ahead again. They followed him again and they all eventually disappeared.

He was blocking the highway. Eventually he moved and I was able to turn right onto Twenty Four. Lisa was in the car with me, in the backseat, and she said ""He's tailing you!"" So I looked back, and sure enough, the man was behind me, bumper to bumper. I kept driving, while looking back to make sure the man didn't slam into me. The man was weaving left and right, he couldn't stay in one direction. So I thought, ""drunk driving is the number one killer of kids!"" I thought that the man might be drunk. I figured that when I reached the next stop sign, I would turn around and go back to see what that man's problem was. Because I wasn't sure if he was drunk or just sick. Maybe he was having a heart attack or something. I would've felt really bad if I saw in the news that a man died of a heart attack while driving and I didn't do anything to help even though I was there. When I reached the intersection I saw a police car parked at the other side of the street. I waved to the police car, and it drove over to me. I told the deputy, ""There's a man driving behind me, I don't know what his deal is, but I think he might be drunk or sick or something. Because he can't stay in one direction, he keeps driving into the opposite lane."" The deputy went down the street to look for the man.

He was driving really close behind me and I thought that he might be drunk. I know drink driving is one of the biggest killers of kids and I knew I had to do something. But then I started to wonder if maybe he wasn't drunk but sick, that he might have a heart attack or something and I'd see in the papers he'd died. So I thought I had to do something.
