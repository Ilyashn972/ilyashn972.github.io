"(1, 3)",About a month ago see we were going to a church league softball game... They'd had the games all scheduled for the diamond at Homestead High School. You know where that's at?,We were heading to a softball game at Homestead High
"(4, 7)","Well we're going up Twenty­-four, and getting ready to turn there, at Ranch Eggs, and I was slowing down, got my turn signal on,",I prepared to turn at Ranch Eggs with my signal on
"(8, 11)","and as I was slowing down, there's this guy sitting over here to the right, coming on to Twenty­-four. Looked like he's about in his middle fifties.",I noticed a man in his fifties creeping onto the road
"(12, 14)","And he starts creeping out onto Twenty-four and he's blocking off the lane, and he's heading for the same spot that I'm going.","He blocked the lane, heading to the same spot"
"(15, 20)","You know how you sit there and wait for the traffic to get by? Right there in the median? This guy starts, pulls out in the lane, I thought ""you jerk""... but I hurried up and got in there ahead of him.","I hurried ahead of him, thinking he was a jerk"
"(21, 24)",And he sits there and waits on. Mean he's got Twenty­-four blocked. He's sitting there right in the middle of the highway. Got it blocked.,"He blocked the highway, sitting in the middle"
"(25, 27)","So we went on across as soon as traffic cleared, and we're headed up there towards that diamond, and it's about ... maybe mile, two miles... north of Twenty­-four on Aboite Center,","We continued towards the diamond, a mile or two away"
"(28, 32)","and this guy's following us see, as we're going up there this little hill right there. At Ranch Eggs. We're going up this hill, and this guy's right on my tail.",The man followed us closely up the hill
"(33, 37)","And Lisa was with me, and she said “That guy is right on your tail!” I looked in the mirror and sure enough he's right up there practically bumper to bumper, and I'm trying to keep an eye on him, make sure he doesn't slam into me or anything.","Lisa noticed him tailgating, I kept an eye on him"
"(38, 40)","He starts weaving back and forth, couldn't keep it in one lane. Really ...bad news.","He weaved dangerously, unable to stay in one lane"
"(41, 44)",And all the time this is going on... I'm thinking how drunk driving is the number one killer of kids and all this business. How it's everybody's responsibility. So I was trying to make up my mind what to do.,I thought about drunk driving and my responsibility
"(45, 49)","I was pretty sure he was drunk... at least he appeared that way... so I figured that when we get up to this stop sign I'm going to go back and find out what his problem is, 'cause I'm thinking he's drunk, and I know I oughta do something about it,",I suspected he was drunk and considered confronting him
"(50, 55)","but at the same time if he's sick, like maybe he's having a heart attack or something, you know. You gotta do something. I'd really feel bad if I read the papers the next day that the guy, some guy died with a heart attack and there I was thinking he was drunk.","I worried he might be sick, not drunk"
"(56, 59)","And I didn't really want to get involved to be honest with you. But I had made up my mind that I was going to, so we pulled up to the stop at this sign, and right across the road stopped a sheriff's car.","I decided to act, then saw a sheriff's car"
"(60, 67)","So I motion for him to come over, and they whip across the road, and I got out the car, walked over there, and said to this deputy “This guy behind me is either sick or he's drunk, but he's got a problem. He can't keep his car on one side of the road.” And I said “He's got a definite problem...”",I informed the deputy about the man's erratic driving
"(68, 73)","So they started down there. And as soon as he sees me get out of the car and walk over there to the police car, the guy stops way far away from the intersection. He stops, and he throws his car into reverse, and starts backing up.",The man reversed when he saw me approach the police
"(74, 79)","When the cops went down there to check him out, he starts backing up going backwards down that road. Pretty soon they catch up with him, and he starts forward again, and they make a U­-turn in the road and start following him, and he's just driving real slow and careful.",Police chased him as he drove slowly and carefully
"(80, 81)",Ha ha it's pretty comical... I don't know if they ever stopped him or not.,"It was comical, unsure if they stopped him"
