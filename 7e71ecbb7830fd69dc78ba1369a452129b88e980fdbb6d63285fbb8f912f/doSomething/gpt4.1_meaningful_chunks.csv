"(45, 49)","I was pretty sure he was drunk... at least he appeared that way... so I figured that when we get up to this stop sign I'm going to go back and find out what his problem is, 'cause I'm thinking he's drunk, and I know I oughta do something about it,",I suspected he was drunk and planned to confront him at the stop sign
