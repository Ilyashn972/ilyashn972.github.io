I saw the sheriff and told a deputy that the guy behind me is either sick or drunk but he has a problem. He can't keep his car in the lane. The deputy starts driving towards the man and the driver starts driving backwards down the hill. When the deputy gets near him, the driver starts going forward slowly. HAHA, it's pretty comical.
