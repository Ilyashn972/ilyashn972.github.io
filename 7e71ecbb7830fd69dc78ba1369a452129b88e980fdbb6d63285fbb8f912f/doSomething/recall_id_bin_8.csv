I was driving down Twenty-Four and was waiting to turn, but a car started going for the spot at the same time. I quickly drove past him and he just stayed stopped blocking the highway. Then the driver started following us. I was with my friend Lisa and she said the vehicle was right on my tail, like almost bumper to bumper. And he was driving all over the place and not staying in his lane. I thought for sure he was drunk, and that I should turn around and confront him. But then I thought that he could also have a medical problem, like maybe he was having a heart attack, and I didn't want to read the news the next day and see that someone died while having a heart attack and I could have done something to help them. Part of me also didn't want to do anything but by then, I had already made up my mind to confront him. Then I saw a sheriff on the other side of the road, so I stopped and motioned for him to come over. I told the sheriff that the man behind me was driving erratically and couldn't stay on one side of the road, and that he was either drunk or having a heart attack, but was having some kind of problem. When I stopped to talk to the sheriff the driver of the vehicle stopped a ways down the road. Then when the sheriff drove after him, he started driving the road in reverse. Then the driver turned the car around and started driving the right way, with the sheriff following. He was driving really slow and it was such a funny thing to witness. I'm not sure if the sheriff ever stopped the driver of the vehicle."

Whilst driving near the church, a man is driving erratically, blocking the highway. They overtake him, but he starts to tailgate them, weaving in and out of lanes. They think he might be drunk but are not 100% sure. They flag a police patrol car, when the driver of the erratic car notices, he reverses and takes a minor road to try to escape. The police car heads in pursuit, but the behaviour of the car changes and it stops driving erratically."

They were driving up 22 and were about to make a turn near Egg Ranch (?) when a guy pulled across into the median and started blocking the 24. They noticed that the guy must have a problem. They first thought he must be drunk but then thought he might be sick - having a heart attack or something. They didn't want to read in the paper that a guy had died of a heart attack when they could have done something by checking so they decided they would check out what was happening even though they didn't want to get involved. They said to Lisa who was in the car that the guy behind them had some problem and couldn't stay on one side of the road. They made a decision to stop at the stop sign a mile or 2 down the road and get out the car and see what was happening in the car behind. When they got to the stop sign a police patrol car pulled up on the opposite side at the same time so they waved the Deputy over. They explained to the Deputy that the guy in the car behind seemed to either be drunk or sick as they were unable to keep their vehicle on one side of the road. When they got out the car to speak to the Deputy they noticed the other car had stopped a ways back and was now slowing reversing back down the road away from them. The police car then drove towards them and they pulled a U-turn and drove away faster. The story narrator never found out what happened to them.

I carried on my way along 24 when I noticed this guy was now following me only he was weaving from lane to lane and driving very erratically. He got me worried now and I commented on this to Lisa and figured the guy could be drunk and that’s pretty dangerous as the main cause of deaths among kids is drunk drivers. I saw a stop sign up ahead and thought to myself I’m going to stop here and see what’s going on with this guy. My first thought was that he was drunk but he could be having a heart attack or be really sick and I’d feel pretty bad if I didn’t check on this guy and then read the news that a guy had collapsed and died and I could have done something to help him. So I stop at the stop sign and get out of my car and notice a sheriff’s vehicle on the other side of the intersection. I go over to the sheriff and explain the situation and tell him he needs to go and check on the guy behind me who is acting strange and is either drunk or sick. Meanwhile the guy behind saw me going to talk to the cop and starts backing down the road away from the cop, the cop keeps heading toward him and the guy keeps backing has car really slowly and carefully away from the cop. I never did find out what happened and if the cop ever managed to catch up with him."

It's his responsibility to report it. The driver then considers he may be sick. Possibly having a heart attack. The driver fears he will regret not doing anything if the man is sick. He hears about it after-the-fact. He decides to stop and confront him. When only a few miles from the baseball diamond, the driver spots a sheriff. He stops to speak with him.

He is concerned this person may be drunk or possibly sick, maybe even a heart attack. When coming across a sheriff car he informs them. The sheriff attempts to follow as the suspect drives slowly and true. The man did not ever find out what the situation was."

He was sitting right there in the middle of the highway, so when the traffic cleared, I went ahead and was getting near diamond close to twenty-four, then we noticed he was following us bumper to bumper. I didn't notice at first but my friend Lisa drew my attention to it. I kept my eye on him so that he doesn't bump into me. He kept driving crazy, moving from one lane to another. I had a lot of thoughts about drunk driving and how it can cause accidents and I thought he is definitely drunk. However, my mind kept bugging me and I thought again, he could be ill or having a heart attack. Either way, I need to check on him to prevent any mishap. I didn't want to feel guilty if something happened so I made up my mind to truly check. Suddenly, I saw the sheriff's car and I signaled them to come over. When they did, I told them that something was wrong with the guy behind me, like he was drunk or ill. Apparently, when I stopped, he also stopped a few miles behind me. When they were approaching him, he reversed, they kept following him and he kept reversing until they had him backed in a corner. When he realized he was being cornered, he started driving forward, they had to do a U-turn and start a pursuit of him. Till date I don't know if they stopped or caught him."

After realizing the drunk driver blocked the road, the storyteller then indicates they and their passenger, Lisa, waited for it to clear a bit before getting out of there from the situation with the drunk driver. As they were going along their way, Lisa indicates that the drunk driver is following them, to which the storyteller confirms. The suspected drunk driver started driving erratically. This was where the storyteller started suspecting the drunk driver to be drunk and made a comment about drunk driving needs to be the responsibility of all of us. The storyteller then starts to question if the person is truly a drunk driver and not someone who is in medical duress. The storyteller then chooses to intervene to ensure that if the other driver was indeed in medical duress, they did not deny them help through hasty judgement. The storyteller pulls up to the stop sign where there was a sheriff signaled the sheriff car over, got out of their car and made their way to the sheriff car to tell them what has been happening with the erratic driving behind them. As soon as the suspected drunk driver saw this, he stops far away from them and starts reversing away from the cops. The cops went for him and soon caught up with him. The drunk driver then threw his car into drive and started going very slow, causing the cops to make a U-turn and go after him. The storyteller says it was comical and does not know if the cops ever stopped the suspected drunk driver."
