10,coming on to Twenty­-four.,8,37,1,60,-7,23
11,Looked like he's about in his middle fifties.,26,46,9,100,-17,54
12,And he starts creeping out onto Twenty-four,13,54,6,80,-7,26
13,"and he's blocking off the lane,",35,69,8,100,-27,31
14,and he's heading for the same spot that I'm going.,6,22,1,20,-5,-2
15,You know how you sit there and wait for the traffic to get by?,4,12,0,0,-4,-12

21,And he sits there and waits on.,3,6,0,10,-3,4
22,Mean he's got Twenty­-four blocked.,10,58,4,90,-6,32
23,He's sitting there right in the middle of the highway.,10,66,3,90,-7,24
24,Got it blocked.,12,53,3,50,-9,-3
25,"So we went on across as soon as traffic cleared,",8,35,0,0,-8,-35
26,"and we're headed up there towards that diamond,",6,29,0,10,-6,-19
27,"and it's about ... maybe mile, two miles... north of Twenty­-four on Aboite Center,",8,38,1,10,-7,-28
28,"and this guy's following us see,",20,69,4,90,-16,21
29,as we're going up there this little hill right there.,4,32,0,40,-4,8
30,At Ranch Eggs.,9,31,0,30,-9,-1
31,"We're going up this hill,",5,29,0,30,-5,1

33,"And Lisa was with me,",35,49,0,0,-35,-49
34,and she said “That guy is right on your tail!”,24,47,0,40,-24,-7
35,"I looked in the mirror and sure enough he's right up there practically bumper to bumper,",20,61,2,100,-18,39
36,"and I'm trying to keep an eye on him,",7,23,0,10,-7,-13
37,make sure he doesn't slam into me or anything.,7,23,0,10,-7,-13
38,"He starts weaving back and forth,",39,82,9,100,-30,18
39,couldn't keep it in one lane.,34,80,7,100,-27,20
40,Really ...bad news.,3,15,0,20,-3,5
41,And all the time this is going on...,2,12,0,10,-2,-2
42,I'm thinking how drunk driving is the number one killer of kids and all this business.,23,64,3,100,-20,36
43,How it's everybody's responsibility.,7,17,0,30,-7,13
44,So I was trying to make up my mind what to do.,5,42,2,90,-3,48
45,I was pretty sure he was drunk...,29,81,6,90,-23,9
46,at least he appeared that way...,11,79,5,90,-6,11
47,"so I figured that when we get up to this stop sign I'm going to go back and find out what his problem is,",18,42,0,60,-18,18
48,"'cause I'm thinking he's drunk,",7,37,4,30,-3,-7
49,"and I know I oughta do something about it,",4,23,1,20,-3,-3
50,"but at the same time if he's sick,",25,74,7,80,-18,6
51,"like maybe he's having a heart attack or something,",26,73,4,80,-22,7
52,you know.,2,16,0,10,-2,-6
53,You gotta do something.,7,39,0,30,-7,-9
54,"I'd really feel bad if I read the papers the next day that the guy,",9,47,0,10,-9,-37
55,some guy died with a heart attack and there I was thinking he was drunk.,20,36,0,10,-20,-26
56,And I didn't really want to get involved to be honest with you.,4,32,3,50,-1,18
57,"But I had made up my mind that I was going to,",8,38,1,50,-7,12
58,"so we pulled up to the stop at this sign,",10,55,7,100,-3,45
59,and right across the road stopped a sheriff's car.,41,81,6,100,-35,19
60,"So I motion for him to come over,",23,76,8,100,-15,24
61,"and they whip across the road,",4,44,0,50,-4,6
62,"and I got out the car,",6,58,0,80,-6,22
63,"walked over there,",4,51,0,70,-4,19
64,"and said to this deputy “This guy behind me is either sick or he's drunk,",56,78,7,90,-49,12
65,but he's got a problem.,22,60,6,70,-16,10
66,He can't keep his car on one side of the road.”,9,55,2,50,-7,-5
67,And I said “He's got a definite problem...”,1,44,2,10,1,-34
68,So they started down there.,7,59,1,60,-6,1
69,"And as soon as he sees me get out of the car and walk over there to the police car,",9,32,4,50,-5,18
70,the guy stops way far away from the intersection.,24,49,7,90,-17,41
71,"He stops,",12,21,6,30,-6,9
72,"and he throws his car into reverse,",36,69,9,100,-27,31
73,and starts backing up.,26,61,6,90,-20,29
74,"When the cops went down there to check him out,",10,54,2,80,-8,26
75,he starts backing up going backwards down that road.,12,51,7,60,-5,9
76,"Pretty soon they catch up with him,",5,49,1,90,-4,41
77,"and he starts forward again,",21,57,1,70,-20,13
78,"and they make a U­-turn in the road and start following him,",28,67,6,80,-22,13
79,and he's just driving real slow and careful.,31,58,5,60,-26,2
80,Ha ha it's pretty comical...,16,33,2,60,-14,27
