35,"I looked in the mirror and sure enough he's right up there practically bumper to bumper,",22.22,64.21,20.0,100.0,-2.22,35.79

41,And all the time this is going on...,2.22,12.63,0.0,10.0,-2.22,-2.63
42,I'm thinking how drunk driving is the number one killer of kids and all this business.,25.56,67.37,30.0,100.0,4.44,32.63
43,How it's everybody's responsibility.,7.78,17.89,0.0,30.0,-7.78,12.11
44,So I was trying to make up my mind what to do.,5.56,44.21,20.0,90.0,14.44,45.79
45,I was pretty sure he was drunk...,32.22,85.26,60.0,90.0,27.78,4.74
46,at least he appeared that way...,12.22,83.16,50.0,90.0,37.78,6.84

48,"'cause I'm thinking he's drunk,",7.78,38.95,40.0,30.0,32.22,-8.95
49,"and I know I oughta do something about it,",4.44,24.21,10.0,20.0,5.56,-4.21
50,"but at the same time if he's sick,",27.78,77.89,70.0,80.0,42.22,2.11
51,"like maybe he's having a heart attack or something,",28.89,76.84,40.0,80.0,11.11,3.16
52,you know.,2.22,16.84,0.0,10.0,-2.22,-6.84
53,You gotta do something.,7.78,41.05,0.0,30.0,-7.78,-11.05
54,"I'd really feel bad if I read the papers the next day that the guy,",10.0,49.47,0.0,10.0,-10.0,-39.47
55,some guy died with a heart attack and there I was thinking he was drunk.,22.22,37.89,0.0,10.0,-22.22,-27.89
56,And I didn't really want to get involved to be honest with you.,4.44,33.68,30.0,50.0,25.56,16.32
57,"But I had made up my mind that I was going to,",8.89,40.0,10.0,50.0,1.11,10.0
58,"so we pulled up to the stop at this sign,",11.11,57.89,70.0,100.0,58.89,42.11
59,and right across the road stopped a sheriff's car.,45.56,85.26,60.0,100.0,14.44,14.74
60,"So I motion for him to come over,",25.56,80.0,80.0,100.0,54.44,20.0
61,"and they whip across the road,",4.44,46.32,0.0,50.0,-4.44,3.68
62,"and I got out the car,",6.67,61.05,0.0,80.0,-6.67,18.95
63,"walked over there,",4.44,53.68,0.0,70.0,-4.44,16.32
64,"and said to this deputy “This guy behind me is either sick or he's drunk,",62.22,82.11,70.0,90.0,7.78,7.89
65,but he's got a problem.,24.44,63.16,60.0,70.0,35.56,6.84
66,He can't keep his car on one side of the road.”,10.0,57.89,20.0,50.0,10.0,-7.89
67,And I said “He's got a definite problem...”,1.11,46.32,20.0,10.0,18.89,-36.32
68,So they started down there.,7.78,62.11,10.0,60.0,2.22,-2.11
69,"And as soon as he sees me get out of the car and walk over there to the police car,",10.0,33.68,40.0,50.0,30.0,16.32
70,the guy stops way far away from the intersection.,26.67,51.58,70.0,90.0,43.33,38.42
71,"He stops,",13.33,22.11,60.0,30.0,46.67,7.89

73,and starts backing up.,28.89,64.21,60.0,90.0,31.11,25.79
74,"When the cops went down there to check him out,",11.11,56.84,20.0,80.0,8.89,23.16
75,he starts backing up going backwards down that road.,13.33,53.68,70.0,60.0,56.67,6.32
76,"Pretty soon they catch up with him,",5.56,51.58,10.0,90.0,4.44,38.42
77,"and he starts forward again,",23.33,60.0,10.0,70.0,-13.33,10.0
78,"and they make a U­-turn in the road and start following him,",31.11,70.53,60.0,80.0,28.89,9.47
79,and he's just driving real slow and careful.,34.44,61.05,50.0,60.0,15.56,-1.05
