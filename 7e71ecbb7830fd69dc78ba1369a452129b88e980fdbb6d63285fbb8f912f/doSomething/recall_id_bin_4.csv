I'm going right there in the median. But I hurried up and got there ahead of him. Sitting there right in the middle of the highway. North of twenty-four, about centre at Ranch. Eggs were going up this hill. And this guy's on my tail. I looked in the mirror. And sure enough, he's right up it. Make sure he doesn't slam into me or anything. I'm thinking how drunk driving is the number one killer of kids. So I was trying to make my mind up what to do. So I figured when we get up to this stop sign, I'll ask him what his problem. Like maybe he's having a heart attack or something. Some guy died with a heart attack. And there I was thinking he was drunk. But I had made up my mind that I was going to. So we pulled up at the stop sign. And seen the sheriff. So I told him this guy behind me can't keep his car on the road. His got a problem. And as soon as he sees me call the sheriff, he drives off. When the cops went down there to check him out. He starts backing up. Going backwards down the road. And then starts forward again. And just driving real slow. I don't know if they ever stopped him or not."
