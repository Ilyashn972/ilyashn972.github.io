1,About a month ago see we were going to a church league softball game...," Roughly a month back, we were on our way to a church league softball match..."
2,They'd had the games all scheduled for the diamond at Homestead High School., The fixtures were all set to take place at the diamond at Homestead High School.
3,You know where that's at?, Are you familiar with that location?
4,"Well we're going up Twenty­-four,"," We were driving along Route Twenty-four,"
5,"and getting ready to turn there, at Ranch Eggs,"," preparing to make a turn at Ranch Eggs,"
6,"and I was slowing down,"," and I began to decelerate,"
7,"got my turn signal on,"," activating my turn signal,"
8,"and as I was slowing down,"," and as I was reducing speed,"
9,"there's this guy sitting over here to the right,"," there was this man to my right,"
10,coming on to Twenty­-four., merging onto Route Twenty-four.
11,Looked like he's about in his middle fifties., He appeared to be in his mid-fifties.
12,And he starts creeping out onto Twenty-four, He started inching forward onto Route Twenty-four
13,"and he's blocking off the lane,"," and began to obstruct the lane,"
14,and he's heading for the same spot that I'm going., aiming for the same exit I was.
15,You know how you sit there and wait for the traffic to get by?, You know the way you pause and wait for the traffic to pass?
16,Right there in the median?, Right there in the center divider?
17,"This guy starts,"," This man began to move,"
18,"pulls out in the lane,"," edging out into the lane,"
19,"I thought ""you jerk""..."," and I thought to myself, ""What a nuisance""..."
20,but I hurried up and got in there ahead of him., but I quickly maneuvered ahead of him.
21,And he sits there and waits on., And he continued to wait there.
22,Mean he's got Twenty­-four blocked.," I mean, he had Route Twenty-four jammed up."
23,He's sitting there right in the middle of the highway.," He was just sitting there, smack in the middle of the road."
24,Got it blocked., Completely blocking it.
25,"So we went on across as soon as traffic cleared,"," So, as soon as we could, we crossed over,"
26,"and we're headed up there towards that diamond,"," continuing towards the diamond,"
27,"and it's about ... maybe mile, two miles... north of Twenty­-four on Aboite Center,"," which is about a mile or two north of Route Twenty-four on Aboite Center,"
28,"and this guy's following us see,"," and this man was still trailing behind us,"
29,as we're going up there this little hill right there., as we ascended the small hill near there.
30,At Ranch Eggs., Right by Ranch Eggs.
31,"We're going up this hill,"," As we ascended the hill,"
32,and this guy's right on my tail., this man was closely following me.
33,"And Lisa was with me,"," Lisa was in the car too,"
34,and she said “That guy is right on your tail!”," and she remarked, “That guy is really close behind you!”"
35,"I looked in the mirror and sure enough he's right up there practically bumper to bumper,"," Glancing in the rearview mirror, I could see he was indeed very close, almost touching our bumper,"
36,"and I'm trying to keep an eye on him,"," so I kept watching him,"
37,make sure he doesn't slam into me or anything., trying to ensure he didn’t crash into us.
38,"He starts weaving back and forth,"," He began to swerve from side to side,"
39,couldn't keep it in one lane., unable to stay within a single lane.
40,Really ...bad news., Definitely troubling.
41,And all the time this is going on..., Throughout this ordeal...
42,I'm thinking how drunk driving is the number one killer of kids and all this business., thoughts about how drunk driving is the leading cause of youth fatalities and such issues crossed my mind.
43,How it's everybody's responsibility., It's a concern for everyone.
44,So I was trying to make up my mind what to do., I was debating what action to take.
45,I was pretty sure he was drunk..., I was fairly certain he was intoxicated...
46,at least he appeared that way..., he certainly seemed to be...
47,"so I figured that when we get up to this stop sign I'm going to go back and find out what his problem is,"," so I decided that once we reached the stop sign, I would confront him to see what was wrong,"
48,"'cause I'm thinking he's drunk,"," convinced he was under the influence,"
49,"and I know I oughta do something about it,"," and feeling a responsibility to intervene,"
50,"but at the same time if he's sick,"," yet considering the possibility that he might be ill,"
51,"like maybe he's having a heart attack or something,"," perhaps suffering from a medical emergency like a heart attack,"
52,you know., you understand.
53,You gotta do something., Something had to be done.
54,"I'd really feel bad if I read the papers the next day that the guy,"," It would be awful to discover in the news the next day that the man,"
55,some guy died with a heart attack and there I was thinking he was drunk., some man had succumbed to a heart attack while I assumed he was intoxicated.
56,And I didn't really want to get involved to be honest with you.," Honestly, I was reluctant to get involved."
57,"But I had made up my mind that I was going to,"," However, I resolved to do so,"
58,"so we pulled up to the stop at this sign,"," and as we reached the stop sign,"
59,and right across the road stopped a sheriff's car., a sheriff’s car was stationed directly across the street.
60,"So I motion for him to come over,", I signaled for the officer to come over.
61,"and they whip across the road,"," swiftly crossing the street,"
62,"and I got out the car,"," I exited my vehicle,"
63,"walked over there,"," approached the scene,"
64,"and said to this deputy “This guy behind me is either sick or he's drunk,"," and informed the deputy, ""The individual in the car behind me is either unwell or intoxicated,"
65,but he's got a problem., and he's definitely facing some issues.
66,He can't keep his car on one side of the road.”," He struggles to maintain his vehicle on one side of the road."""
67,And I said “He's got a definite problem...”," I added, ""There's clearly something wrong with him..."""
68,So they started down there., The deputies then proceeded towards him.
69,"And as soon as he sees me get out of the car and walk over there to the police car,"," Observing me leave my car and approach the sheriff's vehicle,"
70,the guy stops way far away from the intersection., the man halted quite a distance from the crossroads.
71,"He stops,"," He came to a stop,"
72,"and he throws his car into reverse,"," shifted his vehicle into reverse,"
73,and starts backing up., and began to back away.
74,"When the cops went down there to check him out,"," As the officers approached to investigate,"
75,he starts backing up going backwards down that road., he continued reversing along the road.
76,"Pretty soon they catch up with him,"," Eventually, they reached him,"
77,"and he starts forward again,"," at which point he resumed driving forward,"
78,"and they make a U­-turn in the road and start following him,"," prompting the officers to execute a U-turn and follow him,"
79,and he's just driving real slow and careful., with him now driving slowly and cautiously.
80,Ha ha it's pretty comical..., It was rather amusing...
81,I don't know if they ever stopped him or not., I'm not sure if they ultimately pulled him over or not.
