1,About a month ago see we were going to a church league softball game...,"Roughly four weeks back, we were on our way to a church league softball match..."
2,They'd had the games all scheduled for the diamond at Homestead High School.,The fixtures were all set to take place at the field of Homestead High School.
3,You know where that's at?,Are you familiar with that location?
4,"Well we're going up Twenty­-four,","Anyway, we were driving along Route Twenty-four,"
5,"and getting ready to turn there, at Ranch Eggs,","preparing to make a turn at Ranch Eggs,"
6,"and I was slowing down,","and I began to decelerate,"
7,"got my turn signal on,","activating my indicator,"
8,"and as I was slowing down,","and while I was reducing speed,"
9,"there's this guy sitting over here to the right,","I noticed a man to my right,"
10,coming on to Twenty­-four.,merging onto Route Twenty-four.
11,Looked like he's about in his middle fifties.,He seemed to be in his mid-fifties.
12,And he starts creeping out onto Twenty-four,He started inching forward onto Route Twenty-four
13,"and he's blocking off the lane,","and obstructed the lane,"
14,and he's heading for the same spot that I'm going.,aiming for the same direction I was headed.
15,You know how you sit there and wait for the traffic to get by?,You're aware of how you pause and wait for the traffic to pass?
16,Right there in the median?,Right there in the center divider?
17,"This guy starts,","This man begins,"
18,"pulls out in the lane,","driving out into the lane,"
19,"I thought ""you jerk""...","and I thought to myself, ""What a nuisance""..."
20,but I hurried up and got in there ahead of him.,but I quickly maneuvered ahead of him.
21,And he sits there and waits on.,And he continued to wait there.
22,Mean he's got Twenty­-four blocked.,"I mean, he's got Route Twenty-four jammed."
23,He's sitting there right in the middle of the highway.,He's just sitting there in the middle of the road.
24,Got it blocked.,Blocking it completely.
25,"So we went on across as soon as traffic cleared,","So we proceeded across as soon as we could with the traffic gone,"
26,"and we're headed up there towards that diamond,","making our way towards the field,"
27,"and it's about ... maybe mile, two miles... north of Twenty­-four on Aboite Center,","which is about a mile or two north of Route Twenty-four on Aboite Center,"
28,"and this guy's following us see,","and this fellow is tailing us, you see,"
29,as we're going up there this little hill right there.,as we ascend this small incline right there.
30,At Ranch Eggs.,Near Ranch Eggs.
31,"We're going up this hill,","We're climbing this hill,"
32,and this guy's right on my tail.,and this guy is right behind me.
33,"And Lisa was with me,","And Lisa was accompanying me,"
34,and she said “That guy is right on your tail!”,"and she remarked, ""That man is right behind you!"""
35,"I looked in the mirror and sure enough he's right up there practically bumper to bumper,","I glanced in the rearview mirror and indeed he was almost touching my bumper,"
36,"and I'm trying to keep an eye on him,","and I'm trying to watch him,"
37,make sure he doesn't slam into me or anything.,ensuring he doesn't crash into us or anything.
38,"He starts weaving back and forth,","He begins to zigzag,"
39,couldn't keep it in one lane.,unable to stay within a single lane.
40,Really ...bad news.,Truly...troubling.
41,And all the time this is going on...,And throughout this ordeal...
42,I'm thinking how drunk driving is the number one killer of kids and all this business.,I'm reflecting on how drunk driving is the leading cause of youth fatalities and such.
43,How it's everybody's responsibility.,How it's a collective responsibility.
44,So I was trying to make up my mind what to do.,So I was contemplating what action to take.
45,I was pretty sure he was drunk...,I was fairly certain he was intoxicated...
46,at least he appeared that way...,at least that's how he seemed...
47,"so I figured that when we get up to this stop sign I'm going to go back and find out what his problem is,","so I decided that once we reached the stop sign, I would go back to see what was wrong with him,"
48,"'cause I'm thinking he's drunk,","since I suspected he was inebriated,"
49,"and I know I oughta do something about it,","and I felt I should intervene,"
50,"but at the same time if he's sick,","but then again, if he was ill,"
51,"like maybe he's having a heart attack or something,","perhaps suffering from a cardiac event or something similar,"
52,you know.,you understand.
53,You gotta do something.,One has to act.
54,"I'd really feel bad if I read the papers the next day that the guy,","I would have been remorseful if I had read in the newspaper the following day about a man,"
55,some guy died with a heart attack and there I was thinking he was drunk.,someone succumbing to a heart attack while I assumed he was intoxicated.
56,And I didn't really want to get involved to be honest with you.,"And to be frank, I didn't really want to get involved."
57,"But I had made up my mind that I was going to,","But I had resolved that I would,"
58,"so we pulled up to the stop at this sign,","so we arrived at the stop sign,"
59,and right across the road stopped a sheriff's car.,and directly across the street was a sheriff's patrol car.
60,"So I motion for him to come over,","So I gestured for him to approach,"
61,"and they whip across the road,","and they quickly crossed the street,"
62,"and I got out the car,","and I exited the vehicle,"
63,"walked over there,","approached them,"
64,"and said to this deputy “This guy behind me is either sick or he's drunk,","and informed the deputy, ""The man behind me is either unwell or intoxicated,"
65,but he's got a problem.,but he's definitely having trouble.
66,He can't keep his car on one side of the road.”,"He's unable to maintain his vehicle on one side of the road."""
67,And I said “He's got a definite problem...”,"And I mentioned, ""He's clearly in trouble..."""
68,So they started down there.,So they headed down there.
69,"And as soon as he sees me get out of the car and walk over there to the police car,","And as soon as he saw me step out of the car and approach the police vehicle,"
70,the guy stops way far away from the intersection.,the man stopped a good distance from the crossroads.
71,"He stops,","He halted,"
72,"and he throws his car into reverse,","shifted his car into reverse,"
73,and starts backing up.,and began backing up.
74,"When the cops went down there to check him out,","When the officers went down to investigate him,"
75,he starts backing up going backwards down that road.,he continued reversing down that road.
76,"Pretty soon they catch up with him,","Eventually, they caught up with him,"
77,"and he starts forward again,","and he resumed driving forward,"
78,"and they make a U­-turn in the road and start following him,","and they executed a U-turn on the road to follow him,"
79,and he's just driving real slow and careful.,and he drove very slowly and cautiously.
80,Ha ha it's pretty comical...,"Ha ha, it was quite amusing..."
81,I don't know if they ever stopped him or not.,I'm not sure if they ever pulled him over or not.
