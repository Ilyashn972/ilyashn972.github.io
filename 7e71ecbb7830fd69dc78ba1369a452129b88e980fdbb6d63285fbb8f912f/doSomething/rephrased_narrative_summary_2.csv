105,I was going to a church league softball game about a month ago. The games were scheduled at Homestead High School. I was driving up Twenty-four with my turn signal on. A guy in his fifties was blocking the lane. He looked like he intended to go to the same spot as me. I managed to get in front of him. He blocked Twenty-four while waiting. We crossed as soon as traffic cleared. We headed towards the softball diamond. The guy followed us on Aboite Center road. Lisa noticed he was right on my tail. I saw he was close bumper to bumper in the mirror. He was weaving and couldn't stay in one lane. I thought about how drunk driving is dangerous. I considered his condition as drunk or sick. I decided to check on him at the stop sign. I felt responsible for potential issues. I planned to do something at the stop sign. We stopped and saw a sheriff's car across the road. I motioned for the deputy to come over. I informed the deputy about the guy's problem. I said the guy couldn't keep his car steady. The deputy started towards him. The guy saw me talking to the police. He stopped far from the intersection. He reversed his car down the road. The police caught up with him. He started driving slowly and carefully. I found it comical to watch. I'm not sure if they eventually stopped him. The guy's behavior seemed suspicious. I worried he might have health issues. I didn't want to ignore and regret later. I was reluctant to get involved initially. I was determined to act responsibly. I took action by alerting the deputy. The situation felt surreal and amusing.,1569,270.82,275.83,37,38,1
