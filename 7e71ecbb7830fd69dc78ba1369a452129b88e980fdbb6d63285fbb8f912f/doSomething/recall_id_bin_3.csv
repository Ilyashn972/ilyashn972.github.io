The guy is on my tail bumper to bumper I'm watching him to make sure he doesn't back on me and he is stuck really bad. All of the time this is happening I was trying to make up my mind and I was going to go back and figure his mind because he seemed drunk. I really felt bad reading that the guy had to die with a heart attack, I walked out of the car and reported that this guy was drunk and he couldn't keep his car.
