I was expecting to turn at Ranch Eggs. I pulled to the median to wait for my turn and just then another guy in a car wanted to turn as well. There was no room for him on the median so I took my chance and made the turn ahead of him onto Aboite Road. For some reason, he followed me too closely, weaving behind me and staying close on my tail. Even my wife Lisa commented on this. There was obviously something wrong with him. Maybe he was ill, or drunk and he could be a danger to other people. I made up my mind to stop at the next Stop intersection coming up and get out of the car to try and discuss this with him. When I stopped, I noticed a police car on the other side of the road, and I motioned to them and expressed my concern. When the other driver saw the police, he started to back down the highway. The police followed him, saw him reverse again and progress very slowly ahead again. They followed him again and they all eventually disappeared. I never found out whether they caught up with him."

Somehow the driver of this car ended up behind the first driver and he was weaving in and out. The first driver was concerned that the other driver was drunk, or ill, and he was concerned about an accident happening. He pulled up by some police officers (sheriffs) and told them what had happened. They then went back down the road to speak to this other driver but he then reversed his car back down the road, did a u-turn and then proceeded to drive very slowly. The first driver found this funny and wondered whether the police ever got to speak to the other driver."

While trying to turn at Ranch Egg, there was a guy sitting there. He's about his middle fifties and he blocks the lane. I thought you jerk and he got twenty four blocked. While the traffic cleared about a mile or 2 north of twenty four, this guy is following us as we're going up this little hill and my friend Lisa said this guy is on your tail and I looked in the mirror and saw him and he's following bumper to bumper and I make sure he doesn't hit me. He sways from one lane to the other and I think of how drunk driving is the number one killer of kids. I tried to make up my mind on what to do. He appeared drunk. When I get to the stop sign, I'll try to find out. He may be drunk or having a heart attack. I knew I will feel bad if I saw the news that a man died in a heart attack while I thought he was drunk. We saw a deputy and I approached him and told him that driver is maybe drunk or sick. And when the man saw me walk up to the deputy, he reversed and went backwards and the deputy followed. Then he turned and the deputy did a U-turn. Then he started driving slowly. I don't know if he was caught but it was really comical to watch."

So we wait for him to turn but he gets about half way across before the lights change and he's stuck in the middle of the road, right on the median. Anyways we drive through quickly to get ahead of him and when the traffic starts again he begins to follow us real close up Twenty-Four. Lisa was in the car with me and she says ""that guy is following real close"", and I look back in the rear-view mirror and she's right. He's weaving this way and that across the lanes and sticking real close to us all the way up Twenty-Four. We go a mile, maybe two and I'm starting to think about drunk drivers and how they're the biggest cause of death to kids and whatnot, because I'm thinking this guy must be drunk to be driving like this. I think I'll stop at the next light and get out and go back there and see what's up, give him a piece of my mind, but then I wonder if he's actually sick and if I want a confrontation after all. I'd hate it to read the paper the next day and hear about a guy dying of a heart attack on the highway and I had done nothing about it. Anyway, my mind was made up and I was going to go back there when we pull up at a stop sign and there's a police car on the other side of the road, so I call them over. They swing across the road and I get out and say ""that guy back there is either drunk or sick, but he can't keep his car in his lane at all"". They turn the cruiser around and head over to him, and he has stopped a ways up the road. He starts to back up slowly when he sees the police coming towards him, then he starts forward again and drives real slow like back along the road. I don't know whether they ever caught him or what was what haha but it sure was a strange thing."

Whilst driving there, a gentleman from the side road tries to jump in by pulling out. But their car goes ahead filling the gap. Meaning the other guy's car is blocking opposing traffic on the 29th street. This guy then proceeds to follow their car very closely. And is bumper to bumper with them. They notice he is also swerving between lanes. They consider the idea he is possibly drunk. The driver thinks of the amount of teenagers that die due to drink driving. And also considers the driver may be having a medical issue. They decide at the next stop sign they will stop and see what the guy's issue is. As he would feel bad if tomorrow he found out the guy passed due a medical issue. And they could have checked and helped. They find a sheriff's car parked opposite the road when they stop. And so they approach the sheriff. And inform them of the driver's driving. And that they believe he may be having a medical issue or may be drunk. The second driver (the one who may be drunk) hasn't reached the same point as their car. But sees them talking to the police. And starts to reverse back down the road. The police car follows down. And follows the car which has now slowed down. And is driving at a suitable speed and in a sensible manner."

They were in the car on their way to the game when they had issues on the road with an elderly man who seemed to have been drunk driving or sick. The man could not stay in one lane and was going over towards their car. The narrator talks about trying to get away from the man by going up a hill. The man seems to follow them to the point he was bumper to bumper with them. The narrator talks to the passenger called Lisa and tells her that they suspect that the man is drunk or might be experiencing a heart attack. The narrator thinks of ways to help this man as they did not want the man to get hurt or appear in the headlines as someone who got hurt. They look around and see a sheriff's car not too far. They try to go towards the sheriff. The narrator gets out of the car and tells the sheriff what is going on. They see the car of the man slowing down, the sheriff goes into their car and chases after the man and the story ends there."
